{"title": "Dreams Come True (band)", "body": " is a music duo from Japan, formed in 1988 that has sold more than 50 million records worldwide.\\n\\nDreams Come True was started by Bassist Masato Nakamura, and is fronted by Miwa Yoshida, who is the band's main singer-songwriter. They were originally a three-piece band with Takahiro Nishikawa on keyboards, until he departed in 2002. The band is commonly known as DCT (Dreams Come True) and sometimes referred to as  by their fans. Dreams Come True released their self-titled debut album in 1989, which sold more than one million copies. Their 1992 release, The Swinging Star, was the first Japanese album to sell over three million copies, and for several years held the title of the best-selling Japanese-language album of all time. \\n\\nIn 1993, they recorded \"Winter Song\" for the opening theme of the TriStar Pictures film Sleepless in Seattle and the following year recorded the song \"Eternity\" for the animated film The Swan Princess by New Line Cinema. In Japan, they recorded theme songs for TBS television shows, and it wasn't long before they caught the attention of the Walt Disney company, and were hired to create musical-tunes for their television shows, and attractions at the Tokyo Disney Resort. In 2001, they composed \"Crystal Vine,\" the theme song for the Japanese release on the Disney film Atlantis, and Miwa was hired to be the voice actor for the character Audrey Rocio Ramirez in the Japanese version.\\n\\nMiwa Yoshida started a solo music career in 1995, and the following year appeared on the cover of Time Magazine. She has also appeared in advertisements for Sony, Visa, Honda, Shiseido, Lotte, Vodafone, and Coca Cola. Meanwhile Masato was hired to compose the music for television commercials, and around the same time compiled various \"Dreams Come True\" songs for Konami to be used in their game series Dance Dance Revolution. He had previously been hired to compose the music for the first two Sonic the Hedgehog video games on the Sega Mega Drive.\\n\\nOn April 1, 1996, they released Love Unlimited, which would be their final album for Sony Music. News of their departure would cause Sony Music shares to drop severely on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They later signed with Virgin Music America and Toshiba-EMI in Japan, due to that label's promises to break the group into the American market—something Sony was unwilling to do. Their first album under the new contract, Sing Or Die (a title that half-jokingly described the band's relationship with their former label, according to Nakamura), was released in an English-language version, but received very little promotion and even less airplay. It would be the band's final album as a trio, and Takahiro Nishikawa would depart the band shortly after its release. Sing or Die was Virgin's only attempt to penetrate the American market, and its failure would taint the band's future relationship with that label. \\n\\nPart of the failure of the Virgin-DCT relationship can be laid at the label's attempt to renovate the band into something the American audiences could relate to. Miwa dropped her last name, Nakamura became \"King Masa,\" but Nishikawa remained the same, and only received a passing mention on Sing or Die's liner notes. Musically, the album veered away from the classic DCT formula and deeper into the hip-hop dance theme begun on Delicious and Love Unlimited. The combination was not well-received by American audiences, nor DCT's legion of loyal Japanese fans.\\n\\nThere are conflicting accounts concerning Nishikawa's departure. Nishikawa himself states both he and longtime DCT producer Mike Pela were forced out by Virgin because they didn't fit into the label's makeover for the band. However, he also adds that prior to that, he hadn't been touring with DCT for some time, which supports the official account. At present, there seems to be little chance of Nishikawa playing with his former bandmates ever again.\\n\\nFollowing Nishikawa's departure from DCT, he was arrested for assault and drug possession, but received a suspended sentence. However, a second arrest for possession in 2006 netted the musician prison time. Both Yoshida and Nakamura have declined to comment on their former bandmate's legal problems, other than to wish him well.\\n\\nFollowing 2001's Monkey Girl Odyssey, DCT severed all ties with Virgin and Toshiba-EMI, and set up shop with Universal Music Japan. More recent albums such as The Love Rocks and And I Love You have returned to the classic DCT sound, and have been received more warmly.\\n\\nThe band would release one more English-language album on Universal called Love Overflows, which were re-recorded versions of songs from as far back as Love Goes On to monkey girl odyssey.\\n\\nThey have also been involved in charity events. Including the collaboration \"Zero Landmine\" with Ryuichi Sakamoto in 2001 to help raise funds for land mine removal agencies, and taking part in the Live 8 benefit concert in 2005.\\n\\nOn November 12, 2008, their single \"Tsuretette Tsuretette\" was released. \"Tsuretette Tsuretette\" debuted a top on the Oricon weekly charts, nine years ten months since their last number-one single \"Asa ga Mata Kuru\". The song also appears on the band's most recent album, Do You Dreams Come True?. The album is available in three versions: A single disc version, containing the main album; a second that adds Greatest Hits: The Soul 2, a sequel to their 2000 greatest-hits package; and a third that adds a live DVD, \"Winter Fantasia 2008.\"\\n\\nTheir DVD and Blu-Ray of their 20th Anniversary tour is one of the first concert videos to be filmed with the RED One high-definition camera.\\n\\nIn 2010, they will be releasing their download only single \"Godspeed\", where as the title is meant to be an even stronger wish of \"Good Luck\" for everyone to listen to it. In November of that same year, they released their 23rd album, Love Central, their second on Universal Music Japan's Nayutawave label.\\n\\nIn a 2006 survey of people between 10 and 49 years of age in Japan, Oricon Style found the number one selling song Love Love Love (2,488,630 copies) to be the second most popular Valentine's Day song in Japan. The most popular song was Sayuri Kokushō's 1986 debut single Valentine Kiss, which sold only 317,000 copies. The other songs in the top five were Valentine's Radio from Yumi Matsutoya (1,606,780 copies), Happy Happy Greeting from Kinki Kids (608,790 copies), and My Funny Valentine by Miles Davis.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Drinking straw", "body": "rightthumb\\n\\nA drinking straw is a short tube intended for transferring a beverage from its container to the mouth of the drinker by use of suction. The earliest drinking straws were hollow stems of grass, literally made of straw. A thin tube of plastic (such as polypropylene and polystyrene) or other material, straight or with an accordion-like living hinge, it is employed by being held with one end in the mouth and another end in the drink. Muscular action reduces air pressure in the mouth, whereupon atmospheric pressure forces the drink up the straw. The first straws were made by the Sumerians, and used for drinking beer (as to avoid the solid byproducts of fermentation). Argentines and their neighbors use a similar metallic device called bombilla that acts as both a straw and sieve for drinking mate tea. The modern drinking straw was patented in 1888 by Marvin C. Stone.\\n\\nEarly paper straws had a narrow bore similar to that of the grass stems then in common use. It was common to use two of them, to reduce the effort needed to take each sip. Modern plastic straws are made with a larger bore, and only one is needed for ease of drinking.\\n\\nOne particular advantage of using a straw when drinking is the reduction of tooth decay. Many soft drinks have acidic properties, and using a straw reduces the liquid contact with the teeth, reducing tooth decay and the risk of cavities.\\n\\nDrinking straws are a form of plastic consumption when made, and become a landfill item when discarded. Made from polypropylene, they are strong and can be reused rather than recycled into other products. Waste straws in Uganda are collected from beer and soft drink depots, cleaned, and woven into mats for picnics and prayers or joined to form bags.\\n\\nNicholson Baker's 1988 novel The Mezzanine includes a detailed discussion of various types of drinking straw experienced by the narrator and their relative merits.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Drude model", "body": "thumb\\n\\nThe Drude model of electrical conduction was proposed in 1900 by Paul Drude to explain the transport properties of electron in materials (especially metals). The model, which is an application of kinetic theory, assumes that the macroscopic behavior of electrons in a solid may be treated classically and looks much like a table football machine, with a sea of constantly jittering electrons bouncing and re-bouncing off heavier, relatively immobile positive ions. \\n\\nThe two most significant results of the Drude model are an electronic equation of motion,\\n\\nand a linear relationship between current density  and electric field ,\\n\\nHere  is the time and , ,  and , and  are respectively an electron's momentum, charge, number density, mass, and mean free time between ionic collisions. The latter expression is particularly important because it explains in semi-quantitative terms why Ohm's Law, one of the most ubiquitous relationships in all of electromagnetism, should be true.\\n\\nThe model was extended in 1905 by Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (and hence is also known as the Drude–Lorentz model) and was supplemenetd with the results of quantum theory in 1933 by Arnold Sommerfeld and Hans Bethe.\\n\\nThe Drude model considers the metal to be formed of a mass of positively-charged ions from which a number of \"free electrons\" were detached. These may be thought to have become delocalized when the valence levels of the atom came in contact with the potential of the other atoms.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the origin of such free electrons from the contact of different potentials, the Drude model neglects any long-range interaction between the electron and the ions and assumes that the electrons do not interfere with each other. The only possible interaction is the instantaneous collision between a free electron and an ion, which happens with a fixed probability per unit time.\\n\\nThe Drude model is a purely classical model, and treats both electrons and ions as solid spheres.\\n\\nThe simplest analysis of the Drude model assumes that electric field  is both uniform and constant, and that the thermal temperature of electrons is sufficiently high such that they accumulate only an infinitesimal amount of momentum  between collisions, which occur on average every  seconds.\\n\\nThen an electron isolated at time  will on average have been traveling for time  since its last collision, and consequently will have accumulated momentum \\n\\nDuring its last collision, this electron will have been just as likely to have bounced forward as backward, so all prior contributions to the electron's momentum may be ignored, resulting in the expression\\n\\nSubstituting the relations\\n\\nresults in the formulation of Ohm's Law mentioned above:\\n\\nThe dynamics may also be described by introducing an effective drag force. At time  the average electron's momentum will be\\n\\nbecause, on average,  electrons will not have experienced another collision, and the ones that have will contribute to the total momentum to only a negligible order.\\n\\nWith a bit of algebra, this results in the differential equation \\n\\nwhere  denotes average momentum, m the effective mass and q the charge of the electrons. This, which is an inhomogeneous differential equation, may be solved to obtain the general solution of \\n\\nfor p(t). The steady state solution () is then\\n\\nAs above, average momentum may be related to average velocity and this in turn may be related to current density,\\n\\nand the material can be shown to satisfy Ohm's Law with a DC-conductivity :\\n\\nthumbThe Drude model can also predict the current as a response to a time-dependent electric field with an angular frequency , in which case\\n\\nHere it is assumed that\\n\\nIn other conventions,  is replaced by  in all equations. The imaginary part indicates that the current lags behind the electrical field, which happens because the electrons need roughly a time  to accelerate in response to a change in the electrical field. Here the Drude model is applied to electrons; it can be applied both to electrons and holes; i.e., positive charge carriers in semiconductors. The curves for  are shown in the graph.\\n\\nThis simple classical Drude model provides a very good explanation of DC and AC conductivity in metal, the Hall effect, and thermal conductivity (due to electrons) in metals near room temperature. The model also explains the Wiedemann-Franz law of 1853. However, it greatly overestimates the electronic heat capacities of metals. In reality, metals and insulators have roughly the same heat capacity at room temperature. Although the model can be applied to positive (hole) charge carriers, as demonstrated by the Hall effect, it does not predict their existence.\\n\\nOne note of trivia surrounding the theory is that in his original paper Drude made a conceptual error, estimating electrical conductivity to in fact be only half of what it classically should have been.\\n\\n"}

Araceae have numerous druse, multi-crystal druse and needle shaped raphide crytals of CaOx present in the tissue. Druse are also found in leaves and bud scales of Prunus, Roses,  Allium, Vitus, Morus and Phaseolus. , . The poisonous substances in druse are thought to be a prevention from herbivorage.\\n\\nA number of biochemical pathways for calcium oxalate biomineralization in plants have been proposed. Among these are the cleavage of isocitrate, the hydrolysis of oxaloacetate, glycolate/glyoxylate oxidation, and/or oxidative cleavage of L-ascorbic acid. The cleavage of ascorbic acid appears to be the most studied pathway. The specific mechanism controlling this process is unclear but it has been suggested that a number of factors influence crystal shape and growth, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids or macromolecular membrane structures. Druse may also have some purpose in calcium regulation.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dry valley", "body": "A dry valley is a valley found in either karst (limestone) or chalk terrain that no longer has a surface flow of water. There are many examples of the latter along the North and South Downs in southern England. Notably the National Trust-owned Devil's Dyke near Brighton covers some  of downland scarp, and includes the deepest dry valley in the world - created when melting water eroded the chalk downland to the permafrost layer after the last ice age. The three-quarter mile long curved dry valley is around  in height and attracts tourists with its views of Sussex, Hampshire and Kent.\\n\\nOther examples include the Alkham Valley near Dover, and the Hartley Bottom and Fawkham valleys near Dartford in north Kent.\\n\\nThere are two theories as to how they were made, the first that the water table was once much higher, while the other is that during the ice age the area had tundra like conditions. The normally permeable chalk would have been made impervious by permafrost, thus allowing rivers to flow without carving into it. Today these valleys don't have any rivers because water sinks through into the limestone and flows underground in caverns.\\n\\nThere are many examples in the Peak District and the Yorkshire Wolds. A notable example is the valley of the River Manifold which is dry, except in spate, from Wetton south for several miles.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dryandra ser. Ilicinae", "body": "thumbDryandra ser. Ilicinae is an obsolete series within the former genus Dryandra (now ''Banksia'' ser. ''Dryandra''). It was first published by Carl Meissner in 1856, but was discarded by George Bentham in 1870. It was reinstated with a new circumscription by Alex George in 1996, but was ultimately discarded again in 2007 when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele sunk Dryandra into Banksia.\\n\\nThis taxon was first published by Meissner in his 1856 chapter on the Proteaceae in A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis.. Meissner's arrangement followed that of Robert Brown in segregating a single species into the genus Hemiclidia, and dividing the remaining species into three sections according to what were perceived to be variations in the number of seed separators. Meissner then further divided ''D.''&nbsp;sect. ''Eudryandra'' into eight unranked groups signified by the symbol \"§\". The first of these, Dryandra § Ilicinae, was defined as comprising four species with leaves resembling those of Ilex (Holly). The placement and circumscription of D. § Ilicinae in Meissner's arrangement thus looks like this:\\n\\nAlong with many of Meissner's infrageneric taxa, which were overly reliant on leaf characters, Bentham discarded D. § Ilicinae in his 1870 arrangement. The species that Meissner placed there were placed together in ''D.''&nbsp;ser. ''Armatae'', except for D. floribunda (now Banksia sessilis) which Bentham placed in ''D.''&nbsp;ser. ''Floribundae''.\\n\\nWhen Alex George published his revision of Dryandra in 1996, he recycled number of previously published infrageneral names, including Meissner's Ilicinae. George gave it series rank and placed it within ''D.''&nbsp;subg. ''Dryandra''. It was circumscribed as containing three species: D. praemorsa (now B.&nbsp;undata), D. quercifolia (now B.&nbsp;heliantha) and D. anatona (now B.&nbsp;anatona).\\n\\nGeorge's placement and circumscription of D. ser. Ilicinae, as amended in 1999 and 2005, may be summarised as follows:\\n\\nSince 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses have provided compelling evidence of the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra; that is, it seems that Dryandra arose from within the ranks of Banksia. Early in 2007, Mast and Kevin Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by sinking Dryandra into it as ''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Dryandra''. This transfer necessitated the setting aside of George's infrageneric arrangement of Dryandra; thus D. ser. Armatae is no longer current. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete.\\n\\nIlicinae\\n\\n"}

The city used the federal government's slum clearance dollars to renovate the mostly-19th century housing stock instead, and also to plant street trees, bury utility wires underground, and to widen sidewalks and narrow streets. With its now-mature trees and rejuvenated homes, the Duboce Triangle's distinctly residential and yet urbane feel is more remarkable given its proximity to busy Market Street, the city's main thoroughfare.\\n\\nThe official Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association map excludes the point of the triangle at Market and Waller.

{"title": "Duke Blue Devils football", "body": "The Duke Blue Devils football program is a college football team that represents Duke University (or \"Duke\"). The team is currently a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), which is a Division I Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Blue Devils compete in the Coastal Division of the ACC. The program has 17 conference championships (7 ACC championships and 10 Southern Conference titles), 53 All-America, 10 ACC Players of the Year (the most in the ACC), and have had three Pro Football Hall of Fame come through the program (second in the ACC to only Miami's four). The team is currently coached by David Cutcliffe and play their home games at Wallace Wade Stadium in Durham, North Carolina.\\n\\nleft\\n\\nIn 1930, Wallace Wade shocked the college football world by leaving Alabama for Duke, later rationalizing the move by saying that Duke shared his belief that a school should provide its athletes with a strong academic background. Wade's success at Alabama (three national championships) translated well to Duke's program. The team won 7 Southern Conference championships in the 16 years that Wade was coach. He also led the team to 2 Rose Bowls. Wade's achievements placed him in the College Football Hall of Fame. \\n\\nThe most famous Duke football season came in 1938, when the \"Iron Dukes\" went unscored upon for the entire regular season. Duke reached their first Rose Bowl appearance, where they lost 7-3 when Southern California scored a touchdown in the final minute of the game on a pass from a second string quarterback to a third string tight end. \\n\\nDuke would be again invited to make the trip to Passedena for the 1942 Rose Bowl, this time to play Oregon State in 1942. Due to fears of additional west coast attacks by the Japanese in the wake of Pearl Harbor, the decision was made to move the game to Durham. As Duke's stadium was significantly smaller than the regular venue, bleachers were borrowed from North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina, which boosted capacity from 35,000 to 55,000. Despite being 3 to 1 favorites, the Iron Dukes would lose the game 20 to 16. \\n\\nThe football program also proved successful in the 1950s and 1960s, winning six of the first ten ACC football championships from 1953 to 1962 under coach Bill Murray. From 1943 until 1957, the Blue Devils were ranked in the AP Poll at some point in the season.\\n\\nThe football program also had a string of successful years in the late 1980s when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier. Spurrier led the Blue Devils to a share of the ACC title in 1989. The 1989 ACC Title was the last title won by a school in the state of North Carolina until Wake Forest won their second ACC Title in 2006.\\n\\nThe team rose to prominence again in 1994, the first season under coach Fred Goldsmith. The team raced out to an 8-1 record, and was briefly ranked as high as #13 in the country before losing the last two games of the season 24-23 to North Carolina State and 41-40 to arch-rival North Carolina. The 1994 team played in the program's first New Years Day Bowl game since 1962, falling to Wisconsin 34-21 in the Hall Of Fame Bowl, now known as the Outback Bowl.\\n\\nSince 1994, however, Duke's football program has declined, with the team lacking a winning season since. From 1999 to 2007, Duke's football win-loss record was at 13-90; from 2005 to 2007 Duke suffered a 22-game losing streak. In 2008, a judge ruled in favor of Duke after they pulled out of a four-game contract with the University of Louisville; the judge stated that it was up to Louisville to find a suitable replacement as he wrote, in the ruling, that any Division I team would be equivalent or better. Duke's 2009 season gave them five wins and seven losses, the closest the school has come to bowl eligibility since 1994.\\n\\nDuke is consistently ranked at or near the top of the list of Division I-A schools which graduate nearly all of their football players.

{"title": "Duke of Norfolk", "body": "The Duke of Norfolk is the premier duke in the peerage of England, and also, as Earl of Arundel, the premier earl. The Duke of Norfolk is, moreover, the Earl Marshal and hereditary Marshal of England. The seat of the Duke of Norfolk is Arundel Castle in Sussex, although the title refers to the county of Norfolk. The current Duke of Norfolk is Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk. The dukes have historically been Roman Catholic, a state of affairs known as recusancy in England. Despite this apparent handicap however, for Protestant England to have its highest-ranking peer remain a Roman Catholic carried certain undeniable diplomatic benefits that may have protected the dukes from further religious persecution after the reign of Elizabeth I. \\n\\nAll past and present dukes have been descended from Edward I; see Dukes of Norfolk family tree.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nBefore the Dukes of Norfolk, there were the Bigod Earls of Norfolk, starting with Roger Bigod from Normandy (died 1107). Their male line ended with Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who died without an heir in 1307, so their titles and estates reverted to the crown. Edward II then created his brother Thomas of Brotherton earl in 1312. It passed to Thomas's daughter Margaret, and then to her grandson Thomas Mowbray.\\n\\nWhen King Richard II created Thomas Mowbray duke in 1397, he conferred upon him the estates and titles (including Earl Marshal) that had belonged to the earls. His elderly grandmother Margaret was still alive, and so at the same time she was created Duchess of Norfolk for life. Mowbray died in exile in 1399, some months after his grandmother, and his dukedom was repealed. His widow took the title countess of Norfolk.\\n\\nBetween 1401 and 1476, the Mowbray family held the title and estates of the Duke of Norfolk. John Mowbray, the 4th duke, died without male issue in 1476, his only surviving child being the 3-year-old Anne Mowbray. At the age of three, a marriage was arranged between Anne and Richard, Duke of York, the four-year-old son of King Edward IV of England. She remained Richard's child bride until she died at the age of 8.\\n\\nIn accordance with the marriage arrangements, Richard inherited the lands and wealth of the Mowbray family. He was also made Duke of Norfolk. However, upon the death of Edward IV, controversy over the legitimacy arose, as evidence of an earlier marriage on the part of Edward IV emerged. Soon after their father's death Richard, and his brother Edward, were declared illegitimate. Richard was sent to the Tower of London by the new king, Richard III, in mid-1483, thus ending his claim to both York and Norfolk.\\n\\nFor his support of Richard III's claim to the throne, John Howard, the son of Thomas Mowbray's elder daughter Margaret, was created 1st Duke of Norfolk in 1483, in the title's third creation. From this point to the present, the title has remained in the hands of the descendants of John Howard.\\n\\nThe current Duke of Norfolk is Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk, who succeeded his father, Miles Stapleton-Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk, in 2002.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIn addition to the title of Duke of Norfolk, the Dukes of Norfolk also hold the hereditary position of Earl Marshal, which has the duty of organizing state occasions such as the state opening of parliament. For the last five centuries, save some periods when it was under attainder, both the Dukedom and the Earl-Marshalship have been in the hands of the Howard family. According to The House of Lords Act 1999, due to his duties as Earl Marshal, Norfolk is one of only two hereditary peers automatically admitted to the House of Lords, without being elected by the general body of hereditary peers (the other being the Lord Great Chamberlain).\\n\\nAdditionally, the Duke of Norfolk participates in the ceremony of the State Opening of Parliament. He is among the four individuals who precede the monarch, and one of the two of these who walks always facing the sovereign (thus backwards).\\n\\nAs the Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk is head of the College of Arms, through which he regulates all matters connected with armorial bearings and standards, in addition to controlling the arrangements for state functions.\\n\\nHe is one of three claimants to the title Chief Butler of England.\\n\\nThe Duke of Norfolk currently holds the following subsidiary titles: \\n\\nAll titles are in the Peerage of England, save for the Barony of Howard of Glossop which is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. All descend to heirs male except the Barony of Beaumont, which can pass in the female line. The style Earl of Arundel is used as a courtesy title by the Duke's eldest son, the present one of which is Henry Fitzalan-Howard, Earl of Arundel. The style Lord Maltravers is used as a courtesy title by the eldest son of the Duke's eldest son (the Duke's grandson).\\n\\nthumb150px150pxThe coat of arms of the Duke of Norfolk consist of four different elements: the arms (or shield), the crest(s), the supporters, the motto, and the batons of the Earl Marshal. Each will be addressed in turn:\\n\\nOften, the coat of arms of the Duke of Norfolk appears with the garter of the Order of the Garter surrounding the shield, as seen in the arms of Miles Stapleton-Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk. However, this is by no means hereditary. His Grace, the 17th Duke of Norfolk did not become a Knight of the Garter until 22 April 1983. The current Duke of Norfolk, His Grace Edward William Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk, has not (yet) been awarded the Order of the Garter. Thus, the Order of the Garter, or any order of knighthood for that matter, is not necessarily a component of the coat of arms of the Duke of Norfolk.\\n\\nThe shield on the bend in the first quarter of the arms (shown to the right) was granted as an Augmentation of Honour by Henry VIII to Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk to commemorate his victory at the Battle of Flodden Field. It is a modification of the Royal coat of arms of Scotland. Instead of its normal rampant position, the lion is shown with an arrow through its mouth.\\n\\nThe main residences commonly associated with the Dukes of Norfolk are: Framlingham Castle, Bungay Castle, as well as Clun Castle in Shropshire, which are now largely ruins; Worksop Manor, Carlton Towers, Norfolk House in London, and most notably Arundel Castle.\\n\\nFramlingham Castle was originally a part of the properties of the Earls of Norfolk, but when the title fell from use, the castle was administered by the crown. In 1397, it was given to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, by King Richard II. And when the Mowbray line became extinct, it passed eventually to the Howard family. Major repairs to this castle were carried out in 1485 by John Howard. The castle would remain in the Howard family, and thus the Dukes of Norfolk, for a while, but would eventually pass from their possession. In 1553, for example, Framlingham was given to Mary Tudor, sister of King Edward VI.\\n\\nBungay Castle was also originally a part of the properties of the Earls of Norfolk. In 1483, it passed into the possession of the Howards, Dukes of Norfolk, and the family continued to own it, apart from brief periods, until the late 20th century. However, the castle has been in a state of decay for quite some time. And for this reason, the 17th Duke of Norfolk, in 1987 presented the castle to the town, which had already begun restoration attempts on their own, with an endowment towards its preservation. It is now owned and administered by the Castle Trust.\\n\\nCarlton Towers is in Carlton (near Goole), Yorkshire, England. It is a Victorian gothic country house designed by Edward Welby Pugin. It is the Yorkshire home of the Duke of Norfolk. Though the Duke of Norfolk's family still live in part of the house, it is now largely used for wedding receptions and similar events.\\n\\nThe principal seat of the Dukes of Norfolk and their ancestors for over 850 years is Arundel Castle. Built in the 11th Century by Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Arundel, the castle was seized by the crown in 1102. King Henry II, who added on to the castle, in 1155 confirmed William d'Aubigny as Earl of Arundel, with the honour and the castle of Arundel. Arundel Castle is still to this day the home of The Duke and Duchess of Norfolk and their children. The Fitzalan Chapel, founded in 1390 by the 4th Earl of Arundel, is located on the western grounds outside the castle, and has been the burial place of the most recent Dukes of Norfolk. \\n\\nGlossop as an occasional residence is situated in the High Peak District of Derbyshire. As the family became closely connected with Sheffield, The Farm in Glossop became increasingly used, particularly when Henry Howard lived there in the 1760s; when the fourteenth Duke, enlarged The Farm as an occasional residence; and during the time of the fifteenth Duke, Henry Granville Fitzalan-Howard, who had interest in the activities of the City. The Glossop estate was sold by the family in 1925.\\n\\nThe dukedom of Norfolk has gone through three creations: in 1397, when it was the possession of the Mowbray family; in 1477 when it was a duchy of the Duke of York; and in 1483, when it came into possession of the Howard family. Notable members of the Howard Family were Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, second and fifth wives of Henry VIII. Both women were nieces of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, who played a major role in the machinations behind their relationships, and eventually marriages to Henry VIII. Also they were the granddaughters of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. He was the father of Anne's mother Lady Elizabeth Howard, later Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire and Ormond and Catherine's father Lord Edmund Howard, making the queens first cousins. \\n\\nThe following are the men who have held the title of Duke of Norfolk:\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nMany of the Dukes of Norfolk have also been knights of the Order of the Garter. The following list is of those Dukes of Norfolk, along with their year of investiture, that were also Knights of the Order of the Garter across all creations of the title.\\n\\n*\\n\\n"}

The loch provides water power for the Tummel hydroelectricity power station and has the reputation as one of the best wild trout fishing locations in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nDunalastair Water lies at the approximate grid reference of  it has an area of 165 hectares, being 2.5 km long and 800 metres wide at its broadest point. It was formed by the damming of the River Tummel by the Grampian Electric Supply Company in 1933 as part of the Tummel hydro-electric power scheme. The reservoir is narrow at its head, taking the form of a slender wooded glen with the Dunalastair estate situated on the northern bank. The reservoir has roads running on both its northern and southern shores, the B846, which is the road between Pitlochry and Rannoch railway station runs on the northern shore while a minor road from Kinloch Rannoch runs on its southern side. The Water is hemmed in by high ground to the north and south, with Beinn a' Chuallaich to the north and Schiehallion to the south.\\n\\nThe dam itself is 65 metres wide and has two floodgates and several spillways due to the quantity of water which sometimes needs to be released Into the River Tummel. The main purpose of the dam is to act as an intake which supplies water to an open 15 metre wide concrete aqueduct that runs to the south of the River Tummel. The aqueduct flows for five km losing very little height, keeping to the 200 metre contour before feeding the Tummel hydroelectricity power station at the head of Loch Tummel through two large pipes.\\n\\nDunalastair Water is a shallow reservoir, having an average depth of only 1.5 metres and this provides unique biological conditions for birds with the site around the Water being declared a SSSI over an area of 241.6 hectares. Among the birds which can be seen on the site are Old World warbler, Willow Warbler, Bittern, Grey Heron, Egret, Kinglet and Goldcrest. Dunalastair Water is a first-rate venue for fishing with the shallow waters warming quickly and generating good feeding for the fish and providing a huge variety of insect life. There are some very large Brown trout which inhabit the water and feed mainly at night . Fishing is strictly from boats and outboard motors are banned. The dam incorporates a fish ladder this is of the pool and weir design and consists of 18 pools.\\n\\n"}

He is a son of the Horsfall and David-West group of houses in Buguma, in the Asaritoru Local Government Area of Rivers State.Dokiwari is the fifth of eight children raised by their mother and grandmother. As a child Dokiwari played different sports ranging from track and fields, soccer, badminton, powerlifting, to volleyball which has been evident in his agility and strength as a boxer.The young Dokiwari obtained his primary education at Port Harcout Primary School in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. On a successful completion of his primary education, Dokiwari attended Akpor Grammar School Ozuoba, where he completed his secondary education. Duncan Dokiwari graduated with degrees in criminal justice and Advertising from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in the summer of 2008. Dokiwari is an avid reader whose reading interest include philosophy, history, English literature, law and justice, as well as religious literature.\\n\\nDokiwari came out of the same Nigerian amateur boxing program that produced the likes of Peter Konyegwache, David Izon, Richard Igbeneghu, Ike Ibeabuchi, and Friday Ahunanya.As a boxer Dokiwari was a late comer to the sport. He did not lace a pair of gloves until months after his eighteenth birthday. Within a span of 5 short years from 1991 through 1996 Dokiwari rose from a virtually unknown in Nigerian boxing circle to become the country's foremost amateur boxing star. Dokiwari won the prestigious Eagle Belt champion of champions title consecutively between 1994 and 1995 in Lagos, Nigeria. Between 1993 through 1996 Duncan was Nigerian super heavyweight champion.In 1994, Dokiwari won the gold medal at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada. A year later he defeated the Cubans in Cuba by winning the gold medal at the Guama Cup International Boxing Championships. Also in 1995, he was proclaimed the African Boxer of the Year after winning the title at the African Games in Harare, Zimbabwe, where he knocked out all his opponents in the first round.\\n\\nDokiwari's boxing career has been plagued with disputes with promoters and managers since turning professional in July 1997. Dokiwari's boxing skill has been horned by reputable trainer such as Eddie Futch, Thell Torrence, and Mike McCallum. Duncan dropped a decision to Fres Oquendo early in his career, and after running off 10 consecutive victories, dropped a unanimous decision to Dominick Guinn. A year after the loss to Guinn, Dokiwari was stunningly TKO'd in the first by unknown Stacy Frazier. Despite the loss, he continued his boxing career recording impressive wins against tough opposition. In December 2006 Dokiwari won the WBC USNBC Heavyweight title with an impressive 4th round knockout of strong and durable Wllie Palms in Laughlin, Nevada. With the victory Dokiwari became the first man to stop Palms.Speculations about Dokiwari's retirement has been greatly exaggerated. Dokiwari has been deligently practicing in anticipation of a return to the ring in the fall.

{"title": "Dundee Historic District", "body": "The Dundee Historic Village is a historic district located in Dundee, Michigan. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 20, 1990 and was also declared a Michigan Historic Site. This area is commonly referred to as the downtown area of Dundee and was settled almost concurrently with the Old Village Historic District in nearby Monroe. Both were built in their respective locations due to the River Raisin. Originally, the buildings within the district were small, wood buildings, but these were eventually replaced with two story, brick storefronts. Most of the surviving buildings were built between 1866–1900, although the district traces its origins to Dundee's establishment in 1825. \\n\\nThe district itself is located about one mile east of US-23 along M-50 (known locally as West Monroe Street east of the river and Tecumseh Street to the west of the river) at the bend of the River Raisin. The majority of the district is on the north side of the river— including Riley, Ypsilanti, East Main, and Tecumseh Streets. South of the river includes a small portion of West Monroe and Toledo Streets. The district is colloquially known as the “Triangle District” for the unique shape of the grid plan where Riley and Tecumseh streets intersect at a 45° angle to produce a triangular piece of land cut off by Park Place on the west. The original owners of this triangular plot of land donated it to the village with the promise that it remain undeveloped as a park in the center of the growing community. Today, the triangle is known as Memorial Park, complete with a naval cannon and bandstand.\\n\\nthumbThe most notable building within the district is the Old Mill Museum at 242 Toledo Street on the opposite side of the river from the majority of the district. While the facility itself was not built until the 1850s, the dam upon which it is located was first constructed in 1827 and rebuilt in 1846. The facility first served as a gristmill for the growing milling industry in Dundee. Later, the building was converted to produce hydroelectricity as the village's only source of power around 1910. Automotive magnate Henry Ford purchased the building and restored it at great cost in 1934. He used it as a small factory to produce welding tips for his industry, and he was known to make many visits to Dundee. His interest in Dundee was an experiment to see if small towns could be used for his massive, global industry. After Ford's death in 1947, support for this small factory diminished, and it was sold in 1954 to the Wolverine Manufacturing Company, where the building was converted once more to produce paper products. The Wolverine Manufacturing Company used the facility until 1970. The village purchased and revamped the structure and its surrounding 13.8 acres (5.6 ha) for public use as a museum and park. Although the property is praised for its historical nature, it is not listed on the National Register of Historic Places in its own right.\\n\\n"}

The episode was written by Michael Schur, who also acts in the show, and directed by Craig Zisk. It first aired in the United States on October 4, 2007 on NBC.\\n\\nIn this episode, Ryan returns to his old office and reveals his plan to bring technology to Dunder Mifflin. Michael and Dwight try to prove that the personal touch is better than technology. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam reveal their relationship to the rest of the office. Kelly attempts to get back together with Ryan, and Dwight and Angela's relationship continues to plummet.\\n\\nthumbRyan Howard (B. J. Novak) returns to the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of Dunder Mifflin for the first time since his promotion to the corporate headquarters. Although he sports a much more urbane look and attitude, he garners little respect from his former peers. Ryan introduces \"Dunder Mifflin Infinity,\" his initiative to revitalize the company with new technology. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is initially excited about the prospect of getting a BlackBerry, but is warned by Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) that the program is a ploy to get rid of older workers. Creed dyes his hair black with printer ink in an attempt to convince everyone that he's much younger. Michael holds a conference room meeting on the subject of ageism. To show that personal interaction is more effective than new technology, Michael and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) decide to go out and win back the clients they lost in the past year with gift baskets. Each manager they encounter refuses to consider returning to Dunder Mifflin unless the company improves its technology. While driving back to the office, Michael misinterprets his rental car's GPS map system's directions and ends up driving into Lake Scranton. He takes this as further proof that new technology is useless because it \"tried to kill him\". After the lake incident, he and Dwight walk back to one of the former clients to awkwardly get back their gift basket, causing a scene.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) are exposed as a couple when Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) circulates a memo about public displays of affection.

Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) tries to restart her relationship with Ryan, an effort he ignores until she tells him she's pregnant. After going out to dinner, Ryan learns that Kelly's pregnancy claim was a lie that Kelly used in attempt to get them back together. Back at the office, Ryan asks Pam to create a logo for Dunder Mifflin Infinity. Pam is excited about the opportunity to use her art background, but Ryan uses the logo as an excuse to ask her out, which he does in front of Jim. Pam responds that she's dating Jim, which leaves the new boss thoroughly embarrassed.\\n\\nThe episode was the first episode of the series directed by Craig Zisk.

J. Novak grow a goatee. Show runner and executive producer Greg Daniels decided to have Novak lose the goatee, because according to Novak \"a goatee would make Ryan a flat-out chump. And we wanted it to be more subtle.\" In addition to his five o'clock shadow, Ryan was also seen wearing black clothes. Novak explained that \"We wanted him to dress as obnoxious as possible. As much black as possible.\" \"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\" went along with a website that had been created with the same name.

{"title": "Dunderberg Mountain", "body": "Dunderberg Mountain stands at the so-called southern gate of the Hudson Highlands where the region's namesake Hudson River enters a dramatic gorge. It rises about  from the river's west bank above Jones Point, New York, within Bear Mountain State Park and the town of Stony Point in Rockland County, New York. \\n\\nThe bulk of Dunderberg projects into the Hudson River, which describes an arc about its eastern side. Tidal marshes of the river, Snake Hole Creek and Iona Island, lie to the north. On the northwestern side is the abandoned hamlet of Doodletown. At Dunderberg's immediate southern slope is the Hudson River, while to the southwest are outlying neighborhoods of Tomkins Cove, a community or segment of Stony Point.\\n\\nThe mountain as labeled on current U.S. Geological Survey maps and a widely used hiking map, extends about a mile and a half from its easternmost footing on the river at Jones Point. But several summits lying still farther to the west and southwest are evidently part of the Dunderberg formation, or massif, as described by at least some editions of an influential area hiking guidebook. These include Bald Mountain or Bockberg (1,130 feet (344 m)), as well as the Timp (984 feet (300m)), each of which are, however, separately named by the USGS. The Boulderberg, labeled as such on certain maps of historical interest, lies a short distance to the south of the Timp. \\n\\nAs Dunderberg's crest runs inland latitudinally from the river, Timp Brook splits it into northerly and southerly ridges; Bald Mountain lies at the end of the northerly ridge, while the Timp terminates the southerly ridge about two-and a half miles southwest of Jones Point. Timp Brook emerges from a small swamp between the two ridges to flow down steeply to the north around Bald Mountain and thence to the northeast, into the valley known as Doodletown Clove between West Mountain and Dunderberg. \\n\\nClosely following the upper course of Timp Brook was once the main route into Doodletown from the southwest. A half-mile farther west, an old farm road, later used as a fire road and now a foot-path, also enters Doodletown valley, through a narrow gap known as Timp Pass between the Timp and West Mountain. However, since the late 19th century, the main road up the Hudson (now 9W) has circled around the base of Dunderberg near the river.\\n\\nDunderberg was a landmark for British forces during the American Revolutionary War, as troops moved over a pass to the west of the mountain while marching to attack Forts Clinton and Montgomery in 1777. In a report to General William Howe several days after the Oct. 6, 1777 attack, the British commander Sir Henry Clinton wrote that at daybreak, 2,100 troops disembarked from vessels at Stony Point:\\n\\nSir Henry's \"Pass of Thunder Hill\" apparently stood between what is now called Bald Mountain and the Timp, about a mile southwest of the westerly summit of Dunderberg. It lies about a half-mile east of what is now called Timp Pass.The modern 1777 Trail commemorates Sir Henry's route, and was built in 1974–75 as a joint project of the Rockland County Boy Scouts, the Palisades Interstate Park, the Rockland County Cooperative Extension and the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference. The route was determined by Jack Mead of the Trailside Museum at Bear Mountain from British military records and maps drawn by Major Robert Erskine, Surveyor General of the Continental Army.\\n\\nAnthony Wayne, in his successful attack on Stony Point in 1779, used a route that entirely avoids the Dunderberg area, passing nearly two miles to the west of the Timp. A contemporary trail commemorates Wayne's route and is mapped by the New York/New Jersey Trail Conference.\\n\\nIn 1889, the Dunderberg Spiral Railway Corporation formed with the goal of building a hotel at the top of Dunderberg. Tourists were to reach the hotel by means of a steam-powered railway. For the descent, the cars would be powered simply by gravity as the  track wound its way back to the base of the mountain, like a roller coaster, affording scenic views of the Hudson and reaching speeds of up to . \\n\\nDirectors of the Dunderberg corporation included Henry J. Mumford, who with his brother H.L. Mumford, operated the former Mauch Chunk Railroad of similar design as a successful and well-known tourist attraction during the 1870s in what is now Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. The Mauch Chunk Railroad, originally designed for a coal mine, became the inspiration for modern amusement park roller coaster.\\n\\nFunding for the Dunderberg project ran out in 1891 and the system was never completed; the reasons for the failure remain unclear.\\n\\nOne theory holds that the facility was planned as part of the Columbian Exposition of 1893. Verplanck's Point (south of Peekskill) is said to have been considered as a possible location during the planning stage of the Exposition, and it is possible that the funding for the hotel and the railway collapsed after Congress awarded the location to Chicago instead. Although the theory is persistent, no clear documentation has been found to support it.\\n\\nToday, ruins and some signs of the Spiral Railway construction are still visible. The graded areas can be accessed from the Ramapo-Dunderberg and the Timp-Torne trails, and became somewhat popular for walking following publication of William Howell's two volumes of hiking diaries called \"The Hudson Highlands\" in 1933 and 1934, and reprinted by \"Walking News\" in 1982.\\n\\nIn 1890 Thomas Edison began to establish an iron mine by acquiring nearly  on the north slope of Dunderberg and the base of Bald Mountain. Two years earlier, the inventor had created a method for using electromagnets to separate and refine iron ore.\\n\\nThe remains of Edison's mine lie southeast of Doodletown Reservoir south of the abandoned \"Old Turnpike,\" between the Cornell Mine Trail and the Doodletown Bridle Path. A tailings pile is on the hillside. The land was eventually acquired by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission on December 31, 1938. \\n\\nOther abandoned iron mines in the immediate vicinity predate Edison's project, and include those on Bald Mountain and West Mountain.\\n\\nA  so-called upper level section of 9W blasted into the side of Dunderberg was opened to traffic in 1931. The lower section of highway had been constructed in 1911 as a  roadway. The upper-level project was compared in the 1930s with Storm King Highway and the southeastern approach to Bear Mountain Bridge two other mountainside highways along the Hudson built in the same era.\\n\\nFor  the new highway averaged an elevation above the river of between 200 and . The project was undertaken because it reportedly required less excavation and backfilling than that required to widen the lower roadway to four lanes. Funds for the project had been allocated by the state in 1924. Over a period of years the road was temporarily blocked by landslides on a number of occasions. \\n\\nWith the opening of the upper level, the lower highway was to be widened to  and carry only northbound traffic, while the upper level, also  wide, would carry southbound traffic.\\n\\nToday the lower roadway appears on maps as a minor secondary road labeled \"Old Route 9W.\" More than a mile of this route is now called the Jones Point Greenway and is used solely for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. The upper roadway is three lanes and additional blasting has evidently been completed in recent years.\\n\\n"}

They accused each other of various misdeeds, and filed a lawsuit against each other through the office of the Xining prefect. The Judge decided not to issue a ruling on which group was superior to the other in matters of all Islamic affairs, and urged them to behave. \\n\\nMa Yonglin aroused crowds of Hui, Dongxiang, Baoan, and Salars to overthrow Qing in Xunhua, Qinghai. Brigadier General Tang Yanhe sent troops to destroy the rebels. Ma Dahan formed a pact with the fellow Dongxiang Ma Wanfu when rebelling against the Qing dynasty.

{"title": "Dunlop, East Ayrshire", "body": "Dunlop is a village and parish that lies on the A735, north-east of Stewarton, seven miles from Kilmarnock, in East Ayrshire, Scotland. The road runs on to Lugton and the B706 enters the village from Beith.\\n\\nThe name, first recorded in 1260, may be derived from the Gaelic words Dun - a castle and luib - a bend. Therefore it is the fortified hill by the bend in the river. The old local pronunciation was Dulop or Delap without an 'n' and this has led to suggestions of other origins. leftIn the 1600s Dunloppe had two fairs a year for the sale of dairy stock, one on the second Friday of May; and the other called Hallowday, on the 12th. of November. The Estate was erected into the Barony of Dunlop in 1688. Dunlap, Dunlapp, Dunlape, Dunlopp, Dunlope, Dunloup, Downlop, Dalape, Delap, DeLap, Delappe, Dulop, Dulap, Dulape, Dullope, Donlop, Donlap, Dounlap, Dunlip, Dewlap are all recorded variations of today's Dunlop.\\n\\nDunlop cheese, a sweet milk cheese, was first made by Barbara Gilmour who went to Ireland to escape the covenanting prosecutions. Her stone cheese press was said to be preserved at 'The Hill' Farm in the 1860s, but the existing press is dated after her death. The cheese became World famous and created a cottage industry with cheese merchants from Kirktoun buying up the cheeses and taking them to Glasgow for sale. The cheese making used up excess fresh milk and the coming of the railways reduced the need for cheese manufacture. Dunlop cheeses are still made at Clerkland Farm (2010).\\n\\nTam Giffen was reputed to be a warlock from the Dunlop Parish and many anecdotes are told of his marvellous doings in the 1860s. Tam could not get over the flood swollen Lugton Waster so he just ....came through below it. On another occasion he was prevented from helping the Devil blow a man off the thatched roof he was repairing by the man uttering God save me and had to make do with blowing off the man's wig and bonnet; finally he once entered a blacksnith's house by flying down the chimney. Tam died in odd circumstances, supposedly being murdered by the fairies for giving away their secrets.\\n\\nIn 1791 Dunlop is recorded as having six masons, twelve weavers, three smiths, three shoemakers, four tailors and three inn-keepers; by 1874 the village had 10 shoemakers, 8 masons, 6 weavers, 6 smiths, 5 wrights and 1 taylor, but no baker or flesher and the people's health was such that no surgeon was need or writer (lawyer). 1823 saw 'Mackie's Mill', producing woolen blankets, being set up on the banks of the Glazert Water and by 1939 Mackie's Mill was producing carpet yarn and had also branched out to establish two more manufacturing sites. In 1849 a Mr. Wilson set up shop as a ham curer. By the 1930s this ham curing business had diversified, and branched out into Ireland and had factories in Barrhead and at Eglinton in Irvine; the original curing house, known as the 'Burnhouse' has been landscaped and transformed into a local park thanks to funding from the Barcapel Foundation, previously the Clement Wilson Foundation. Robert Howie and sons started a small meal-mill in 1857, and then established a sawmill. They moved closer to the railway, where they remained until recently (2010).\\n\\nThe railway finally came to Dunlop in 1871 and because of the improved connection with Glasgow the farmers were able to send their milk directly into Glasgow, resulting in the decline and finally the cessation of cheese making in Dunlop. The population of the village in 1871 was 380 and 357 in 1881, whilst the parish was 1160 and 1361 persons respectively. In 1876 the town had acquired a butcher, a baker, a branch of the Clydesdale Bank, as well as a Free Church (1845), but still no writer or doctor was needed. By the 1950s Dunlop had a post office, four grocers, a baker, a newsagent, a hotel, and a public House.\\n\\nleftA tradition states that the De Ross first held Boarland or Dunlop Hill (NS 4019 4940) as their seat and a well fortified structure existed there, later their seat was moved to Corsehill in Stewarton. A Celtic hillfort may have existed here, as suggested by the etymology of the placename.thumbIn 1848 the Scottish Journal records that a number of years ago the foundation of a ruin of considerable extent was removed by the late proprietor. In 1853 Mr. Dobie recorded that There can still be traced the meiths (boundary line) of a building of considerable extent on the top of the Hill of Borland. Mr. G. Howie, of Dunlop in 1856, stated that he remembered seeing a small portion of what was said to be one of the walls about 70 or 80 years ago. It was a sort of bank, quite crumbled down and overgrown with grass. Since then, the ruins of a building of considerable extent have been removed and the ground cultivated. On the southern side of the hill there are the remains of a wide ditch or fosse, locally known as the 'Cuckoo slide.' Paterson in 1866 states that the foundation of a ruin was removed some years ago by a late proprietor.\\n\\nPont states that the ancient strong Dunlop Castle situated by the Clerkland Burn (NS 42737 49312) was protected by a moat or fosse of water and had 'goodly' orchards. Smith records that the 'Airn Yett' of the old castle was still preserved and its details published (see Wikimedia). It was also called Hunt Hall because the Dunlops were huntsmen to the De Ross family (Paterson 1866). The whole estate was sometimes referred to as Hunt Hall. This castle was situated at the site of the present day Dunlop House.\\n\\nThe De Ross family were vassals to the De Morvilles, Overlords of Cunninghame. The De Morvilles backed John Balliol's claim to the crown and forfeited their lands to the Boyds, and in 1570 the lands were held by the Cassillis family. In 1600 it is noted that David Dunlop of Hapland excambied his lands with Patrick Cunninghame for his portion of the lands of Borland.\\n\\nThe native chiefs, although displaced from Boarland Hill do not appear to have been exiled, instead they established themselves at what is now Dunlop House. The name Boarland also survives in the names of Borlandhill, Over Borland, North Borland and Low Borland. The name Boarland could refer to the presence of wild boar, however a 'Boor' also meant a serf and Norman lords often apportioned lands near their castles for their servants. The Borland or Bordland also meant the land that was granted to the feudal superior specifically to be used to furnish food for his castle or dwelling.\\n\\nThere has been a modern day military use of Dunlop Hill, for in the 20th-century, between the two World Wars, a Royal Observer Corps post was built into the west facing side of the hill. The personnel tracked enemy aircraft movement up the Clyde towards Glasgow. Development of more sophisticated radar tracking techniques after World War 2 made the facility redundant.\\n\\nleftThe first recorded Dunlop is William de Dunlop of 1260, followed by a supporter of Edward I, Neil Fitz-Robert de Dulap of 1306. His estates were forfeited due to his support for John Balliol, as were those of the De Rosses. The family regained their lands by the mid 15th. Century and by that time we have 'of that Ilk' replacing the Norman 'de'. Sir James Dunlop of that Ilk held the estate in 1596 and married Jean, daughter of Somerville of Cambusnethan, descended from Lord Somerville. This may go some way to explaining why the Somerville family came to purchase lands at Montgomery-Crivoch and Bollingshaw in the 1800s to establish the Kennox Estate.\\n\\nFrancis Dunlop was a witness to the disposition of the Scottish Regalia in Edinburgh Castle after the Union of the Crowns. James Dunlop of 1634-1670 married Elizabeth, daughter of Cunninghame of Corsehill and was an outstanding leader of the covenanters. John Dunlop 1748-1784 married the daughter of Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie. thumb was the patron of Burns already referred to. John Dunlop Esq. MP was resident at Dunlop House in 1837 and Pigot describes it as one of Ayrshires' handsomest mansions, with the Ogrestone or Thurgatstane lying within its estate boundaries. The house was designed in 1831-34 by David Hamilton for Sir James Dunlop of Dunlop. The house is an unusual Scottish-Jacobean style, but the gate lodge is more typical of Hamilton, with strap work, classical and manorial features (Milligan). The last Baronet was Major Sir James Dunlop of 1839-1858 who died unmarried. \\n\\nThe last of the Dunlops to be born at Dunlop were John (1904) and Alexander (1906) Houison Crawfurd. Mrs Houison Crawfurd is remembered for producing the first tubercular-free cattle in Ayrshire. The house was let to a number of tenants, the Henderson family of the Anchor Line being the most notable. In 1933 the house was sold to Ayrshire County Council as a home for mentally defective children. \\n\\nThe Clerkland Burn rivulet runs past the Dunlop House mansion, forming the boundary between the parishes of Stewarton and Dunlop.\\n\\nThe Brechna Braes area lies close to Dunlop and has been developed as the Templehouse Community Woodland to celebrate the 2000 Millennium. The Brackenheugh is a wooded slope overlooking Aiket Castle. It is said to be the site of the death of one of the Cunninghames of Aiket, killed by a Montgomerie during the times of the feuds between these families.\\n\\nIn 1516 John Major or Mair, said to be the instructor of John Knox held the post of vicar, mostly absentee as he was a professor of theology. By 1566 the vicar was was John Houston, who held the manse, garden and an acre of land adjoining the manse. The rest of the Kirkland-Dunlop lands passed from the Abbots of Kilwinning to William Cunninghame of Aiket and remained with the Cunninghames until the latter half of the 17th century. The Earl of Eglinton held the right of patronage when it was abolished in 1875.leftthumbThe church (NS 40474 49414) was probably built in around 1766, however by 1834 it was dilapidated and demolition followed, resulting in the construction of the Dunlop parish church, opened in December 1835, that we see today. This was took place under the ministry of Mathew Dickie, who left to join the Free Church at Beith in 1843. Parts of the original building are in use as tomb stones. Barbara Gilmour, famous for introducing the production of Dunlop cheese, is buried in the churchyard. Major McAlester of Kennox, then a heritor, obtained the 1792 bell and Miss McAlester and Charles G. S. McAlester returned it to the Kirk Session in 1935 to honour the centenary of the present church. son of Hans Hamilton, first Protestant minister of Dunlop Parish. In 1839 a new school was opened.\\n\\nThe Rev William Gebbie was the last minister to come into the parish under the old system of patronage, in this case that of the Earl of Eglinton. William was a fervent evangelist and the 'Dunlop Revival' shook the whole parish until the reverend was charged with heresy in the early 1860s. He remained as minister until 1883.\\n\\nThe old manse was sold and a new manse and offices were built by the heritors under the incumbency of Thomas Brisbane in 1781. This manse adjoined the 7 acres of the glebe and was extended by the Revd Dickie. The Kirktoun of Dunlop composed the manses and a row of cottages dated 1644, 1765, 1773, etc.\\n\\nJohn or Hans Hamilton (1535/6–1608), son of Archibald Hamilton of Raploch, was the first Protestant vicar and exhorter of Dunlop Church. One of his sons, James Hamilton was created Viscount Claneboye for his many services to James VI in establishing and maintaining Protestantism in Ireland; his son James was in turn created Earl Clanbrassil by Charles I. His five brothers also established estates in Ireland. A handsome mausoleum (NS 40486 49398) was constructed over their graves by James in 1641, when he was in his eighties, and this was so ornately painted and gilded in the Roman Catholic manner that it attracted the sobriquet of 'The Picture House'. The flat tombstone of Hans Hamilton was originally on the floor, but this was later removed and placed on the south wall. It was much neglected and vandalised even in 1699, but in 1734 it was given some much needed repairs. Around 1849 Colonel Mure of Caldwell had further repairs carried out. The marble statues of Hans and his wife have now been removed to a place of safety for their protection (2005).\\n\\nJean Hamilton, the daughter of Hans Hamilton, had a dowary of 5000 merks in 1613.\\n\\nViscount Claneboye also built and invested a school, now known as Clandeboye Hall (Claneboye in his title was spelt differently from the placename Clandeboye) and used by the church for events. Carved above the door was the date 1641 with the statement This school is erected and endowed by Iames Clandeboyes, in love to this parish in which his father Hans Hamilton was pastor 45 years in King Iames the sixt his raigne. The carving was removed when the school was sold as a private dwelling. The school had been condemned by 1876 and was in use as a shoemaker's shop and a dwelling.\\n\\nthumbAiket Castle itself was originally a square tower typical of the residences of the lesser feudal Norman barons, originally surrounded by a moat. The name is derived from 'Oak Wood'. The family were descended from the Cunninghames of Bedland, who were cadets of the family of Glencairn. Alexander Cunninghame is the first recorded as living at Aiket. Three Aiket daughters were married to participants in the tale of the murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton.'\\n\\nOn top of the Commoncraigs or Common Crags overlooking Dunlop and the Glazert is a large procumbent boulder known on the OS map as the ‘Carlin’s Stone or Stane’. A Carl is a commoner, a husband or in a derogatory sense, a churl or male of low birth. More commonly the name Carlin was used as a derogatory term for a woman meaning an 'old hag'. It is also said to be a corruption or Scots equivalent of the Gaelic word “Cailleach”, meaning a witch or the 'old Hag', the Goddess of Winter. This would therefore be the Witch’s or Hag's Stone, one of several in Scotland with this name. Near Kirkhill outside Stewarton are several farms having the name 'Kilbride' in their title. Bride - an anglicization of Brìghde, Brìd or Saint Brigid- was originally the Celtic Goddess linked with the festival of Imbolc, the eve of the first of February. Carlin's Tooth is the name of a rock outcrop in the borders between Knocks Knowe and Carter Fell. Three farms named 'Carlingcrags' are to be found above Darvel in East Ayrshire.\\n\\nleftThe Thurgartstone is just outside of Dunlop on the Lugton Road in the valley of the Black Burn. It is in a sheltered spot, with ample running water and well hidden from immediate view. In the middle of a field near the Chapel Crags is the Thurgatstane or Ogrestane, also known as the Thorgatstane, Field Spirit Stane, T'Ogra Stane, Thugart Stane, Ogirtstane, Ogart stane, Horgar Stane, Fiend's Stane or Thougritstane. It is a glacial erratic stone, composed of blue augitic porphyrite and is quite unlike the 'native' stone of the district, weighing about 25 tons and measuring about twelve feet by eight feet as measured above ground. It is set near the site of the pre-reformation St.Mary's Chapel and has long been associated with pagan ritual practices. right\\n\\nFew places have so many different names attached to them. One explanation is that the stone is 'Thor's Great Stone', another is that is \"Thou Great Stone\" or just '\"grit stane\", whilst 'The Stone of the Ogre' may reflect some forgotten legend of how the stone came to be in this position. Some names may be spelling errors perpetuated by or from Ordnance Survey and other maps. Another explanation of the name is that it is derived from 'Tagairtstane,' meaning the priest's stone. This 'Druidical' stone may have been a 'rocking or logan' stone at one time, but it is now firmly set in the 'rubbish' and soil.\\n\\nIt is recorded that even as late as \"the time of Popery\" the devotees of that religion, in doing penance, used to crawl on their knees round this stone and cry, O thou grit stane from a belief that the Deity was in a peculiar manner present at that hallowed relic. Farmers from Brandleside Farm were bound to protect, by not removing it or ploughing within a set distance of the stone, possibly because of a tradition of pagan burials around this monument. Some recollections of May Day events being held at the site are current and the site is listed and protected by Historic Scotland. A fine view of Dunlop or Borland Hill, the site of Dunlop Castle once held by the De Ross family, can be seen from the stone.\\n\\nThe history of the monastic settlement and the chapel of Saint Mary (NS 4080 5032) at the Thurgartstone is a parallel example to the Chapel Hill site at Chapeltoun, where a Christian centre was established to supplant the pagan significance of the site. Monastic cells, a chapel and a graveyard are all lost to view, constructed by the monks of Kilwinning, only the name 'Saint Mary's' given to the nearby 'modern' dwellings, built on the site of the chapel record past significance. Chapelhouse Farm is located beside the road nearby. The Holy Well still exists, the nearby houses pumping water up from its source. The water from the well used to run under the road and emerge in a trough surrounded by a metal fence. Only a concrete manhole indicates this trough now (2006). In 1856 the water for baptism in Dunlop Kirk was still drawn from this Holy Well.thumb\\n\\nThe small chapel had an endowment for the support of a chaplain. It was abandoned at the time of the Reformation in Scotland led by the ex-Roman Catholic priest John Knox (1514 to 1572). The stones were robbed / mined by locals and the last remaining stones were taken away by a farmer in the 1830s. It stood on a rock from which a beautiful stream of water gushed into a small rivulet, this originally being crossed by steps, called the Lady's steps before the Chapelhouse Bridge was built. A carved relic of the old chapel, supposed to have been the font for holy water, was for some years used a trough for the pigs until it was finally broken up and used as building material. The Lady's Steps still existed in the late 1880s as they were on the path that ran from here to the Kirktoun of Dunlop Steps cut out of the rock face led up to the hill behind the chapel where the monk's graveyard was apparently located.\\n\\nThe 1858 OS map locates the Lady's Steps near Hapland Mill on the Stewarton side of the town, crossing the Glazert. Patterson and Bayne, both local people writing in 1866 and 1935 respectively, place the steps at Chapel Crags. The first Statistical Account of Ayrshire also places the steps at Chapel Crags. It seems odd to name these steps after a chapel that is a significant distance away in another valley; a cartographers error explains the situation as recorded in the first OS Name Book. A field near the 'Druid Stone' is called Templecroft and the first Celtic ‘Culdee’ church may have been situated here, later replaced by the Roman Catholic Chapel. Ironically the pagan or Druidical stone is still there, but no sign of the Christian sites are visible, apart from the inconspicuous holy well in the field bordered by the burn.\\n\\nthumbThis Lea or Law hill,  high, in the Lugton area of Dunlop Parish is supposed to be a 'moot' or trial hill. The arrangement of stones on its summit does not appear to be accidental and a grass covered cairn is very noticeable. A farmer from East Halket (pronounced 'whoreket') removed one of these to facilitate his ploughing. One stone on the summit has a vertical hole drilled to the depth of four feet or so, presumably to be used for ‘slot’ for a flagpole for flying a standard, a similar arrangement to that which existed at the Borestone at Greenhills near Beith. Near Aiket Castle is another Court Hill. Halket is called Hawkhead by Thomson on his map of 1832. Halket Loch covered about  and was drained in the 1840s. It is shown on the early maps of Ayrshire.\\n\\nA monastic Grange, probably belonging to Kilwinning Abbey may have existed here before the Reformation as suggested by the numerous placenames evidence, with Grangehill, Townhead of Grange, Mid Grange, South Grange, etc. A glebe field was also located here and an old drove road which ran passed Carswell Farm and up to Paisley.\\n\\nCraignaught Hill lies in the north-east area of the Parish of Dunlop, the Clerkland Burn running beneath and on to Dunlop House. On the lower slopes of Craignaught Hill was fought a singularly unusual battle between the Boyds of Kilmarnock and the Stewarts of Darnley. Sir Alan Stewart had been treacherously slain by Sir Thomas Boyd; his son Alexander Stewart, was determined to take revenge.\\n\\nSir Thomas Boyd was surprised on the night of 9 July 1439, whilst riding past Craignaught on his way north and although outnumbered, he and his followers fought on, even taking agreed rest periods indicated by the sounding of a horn. The remaining Boyds placed themselves back to back, they closed up their ranks, and, forming a circle, they grimly set themselves to beat back the Stewarts or else die where they fought. Eventually and inevitably Sir Thomas Boyd was killed, whilst fighting Sir Alexander Stewart himself, stabbed in the back by a Stewart soldier, and a large number of his followers were also killed. The name is given as Sir Robert Boyd in at least one version of the tale.The results of this encounter led to killings and counter killings which involved a great part of the West of Scotland. Boyd's wife had previously dreamed all of that which came to pass and died of grief within days of her husband death. The 1860 OS marks 'Boyd's Hill' and 'Boyd's slack', Scots for a narrow pass, to the north of Craignaught on the old lane to Grange Farm, now named South Grange.\\n\\nBoyd's Hill has been left undamaged (2007) by the quarrying and domestic waste disposal operations at Craignaught and the Boyd's slack is also clearly identifiable.\\n\\nThe Knights Templar are remembered in the name of this property, which since 1570 was in the hands of the Gemmill or Gemmell family. In 1596 Patrick Gemmill resigned the Templelands of Dunlop Hill into the hands of the Superior, Lord Torphichen, in favour of his eldest son. The Sandilands, Lords Torphichen are remembered elsewhere, such as Sandilands Farm near Kennox, although the farm name has now been changed to Bankend. The Gemmells still held Templehouse in the 1860s.\\n\\nPrior to 1549 Hapland was part of the estate of Dunlop. David Dunlop exchanged or 'excambied' Hapland for the lands of Borland and in 1612 Patrick Cunninghame sold these lands to Gabriel Porterfield, son of Alexander Porterfield of that Ilk. Gabriel Porterfield of Porterfield in 1618 married Mariot Crawfurd and inherited the lands of Gills, Lothrihill, the Templeland and Maynes (Mains) of Hapland, including the mansion house. Gabriel Porterfield also took possession of Dunlop Hill, Wattirland (Waterland) and Halketh, with the loch (now drained). Dobie relates that On 31 May 1638, Gabriel Porterfield purchased from Neil Ryburn of that Ilk the 13s 4d. land of old extent of Ryburn, commonly called Temple-Ryburn. The estate of Hapland consisted of Brokwelmure (Brockwellmuir), Dunlophill-Montgomerie and Ryburn; later part of Lainshaw was purchased as well. \\n\\nThe Laird of Hapland was the ruling elder in the Parish of Dunlop in 1649 and was a captain in the Scots army when Cromwell was in Scotland, for which his lands were sequestrated. The last of the male line died when he fell off his horse when returning from Stewarton about 1765 or 1770. Lillias Porterfield married William Somerville of Kennox. Their youngest child, a daughter, married Colonel McAlester, Laird of Loup, in Kintyre. A descendent built Chapelton House near Stewarton. Hapland is near Dunlop. In 1820 the estate was of  and the proprietor was Lieutenant-General Alexander Trotter. The old mansion house was demolished around 1876 as it was not in keeping with the modern age. A new steading was built at the site, possibly the 'Newhouse' marked on the OS maps. Some of the old tree wind-breaks and policies of the estate can still be made out. It seems likely that Temple-Ryburn had its name changed to Hapland at around this time as the OS of 1858 shows Ryburn in the same position as later maps (1897, etc.) show Hapland.\\n\\nthumbDunlop had a cricket club near Mains of Aiket beside the railway.\\n\\nIn 1820 Dunlop had only two people qualified to vote by right as freeholders.\\n\\nA new gravitational water supply was opened for Dunlop in 1896, fed from a spring at Sidehead, the old water supply having been condemned.\\n\\nDunlop and Stewarton both stand on the old turnpike, completed from Glasgow by Lugton, to Kilmarnock, Irvine and Ayr in 1820 at the cost of £18,000.\\n\\nDunlop Cattle are said to have originated within the parish, bred by Dunlop of that Ilk from improved stock from Holland in around 1550 to 1700 or later. The breed, also known as Cunninghame or Ayrshire cattle are pied, white and brown, short in leg, long in the horn, straight in the back: the bulls are fiery in temper. The cows are peculiarly placid and docile, producing milk which is very high in butterfat.\\n\\n"}

It was formerly an incorporated town encompassing the surrounding area with a total population of 12,000. It is located near the mouth of the Grand River in Haldimand County, Ontario, near the historic Talbot Trail.\\n\\nOriginally built as the entrance to the Welland \"feeder\" canal, the town once boasted several water-powered mills and a once-bustling canal port. The feeder canal closed in the late 1880s and the last mill was destroyed and replaced with a condominium complex about 10 years ago.\\n\\nThere is an impassable dam at Dunnville which regulates the level of the Grand River at Port Maitland which, in the 19th century, also helped regulate the level of the Welland Canal (from 1829 until 1887 when the (3rd) canal began to intake its water directly from lake Erie).\\n\\nDunnville was incorporated as a village in 1860 and then as a town in 1900. In 1974, the town amalgamated with the townships of Dunn, Canborough, Moulton and Sherbrooke when the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk was formed. In 2001, Dunnville and all other municipalities within the region were dissolved and the region was divided into two single tier municipalities with city-status but called counties. What was the incorporated town of Dunnville now consists of Wards 5 and 6 in Haldimand County. \\n\\nOnly a few kilometres from Lake Erie, Dunnville has many private vacation properties. \\n\\nThere are many events and natural attractions. In June the annual Mudcat Festival is held to celebrate one of the Grand River s most well-known inhabitants. The festival includes a parade, strongman contests, midway, fireworks and more. Another popular event is the Dunnville Agricultural Fair, held in late August which includes heavy, light and miniature horse shows; sheep and goat shows and much more.\\n\\nDunnville has tennis, golf, lawn bowling and swimming facilities and many Bed & Breakfasts to stay in while enjoying these activities. The community s camping experience is also second to none. Tuesday and Saturday are Farmers Market days. \\n\\nThe former World War II RCAF Training Base, the Dunnville Airport, offers a unique window on history with its massive hangars and runways now used for recreational flying and skydiving. The airport is also home to Haldimand County's newest museum, the No. 6 RCAF Dunnville Museum.\\n\\nThe Grand River and nearby Lake Erie offer a host of aquatic activities from swimming, sailing, wind-surfing, canoeing and feature prime locations for fishing. \\n\\nHike through Byng Island Conservation Area or Rock Point Provincial Park or enjoy a stroll along Port Maitland's beautiful, brand-new pier. In the fall, Rock Point hosts thousands of Monarch butterflies heading south. Dunnville is also the site of one of the largest expanses of provincially significant wetlands in Ontario and is perfect for bird watching and nature photography.\\n\\nSmuckers Foods of Canada Co., which operates the Bick's Pickle Plant (Dunnville's largest factory), provides employment for a small percentage of the town's population, mainly students. The Bick's facility is scheduled to close in 2011, which had moved from Scarborough, Ontario to Dunnville in 2001.\\n\\nOn February 13, 2009 the Grand River flooded when the river ice thawed, damaging Cayuga and Dunnville.On February 14, 2009, the CCGC ''Griffin'' proceeded up the river to help clear ice.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dura mater", "body": "The dura mater (), or dura, is the outermost of the three layers of the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The other two meningeal layers are the pia mater and the arachnoid mater. The dura surrounds the brain and the spinal cord and is responsible for keeping in the cerebrospinal fluid. The name \"dura mater\" is derived from the Latin \"hard mother\" or \"tough mother\", and is also referred to by the term \"pachymeninx\" (plural \"pachymeninges\"). The dura has been described as \"tough and inflexible\" and \"leather-like\".\\n\\nthumbThe dura mater has several functions and layers. The dura mater is a sac (aka thecal sac) that envelops the arachnoid mater. It surrounds and supports the dural sinuses (also called dural venous sinuses, cerebral sinuses, or cranial sinuses) and carries blood from the brain toward the heart.\\n\\nThe dura mater has two layers, or lamella: The superficial layer, which serves as the skull's inner periosteum, called the endocranium; and a deep layer, the actual dura mater.\\n\\nthumbThe dura separates into two layers at dural reflections (also known as dural folds), places where the inner dural layer is reflected as sheet-like protrusions into the cranial cavity. There are two main dural reflections:\\n\\nOther two dural infoldings include the cerebellar falx and the sellar diaphragm\\n\\nThe two layers of dura mater run together throughout most of the skull. Where they separate, the gap between them is called a dural venous sinus. These sinuses drain blood and cerebrospinal fluid from the brain and empty into the internal jugular vein.\\n\\nThey drain via the arachnoid villi, which are outgrowths of the arachnoid mater (the middle meningeal layer) that extend into the venous sinuses. These villi act as one-way valves.\\n\\nMeningeal veins, which course through the dura mater, and bridging veins, which drain the underlying neural tissue and puncture the dura mater, empty into these dural sinuses.\\n\\nMany medical conditions involve the dura mater. A subdural hematoma occurs when there is an abnormal collection of blood between the dura and the arachnoid, usually as a result of torn bridging veins secondary to head trauma. An epidural hematoma is a collection of blood between the dura and the inner surface of the skull, and is usually due to arterial bleeding.\\n\\nThe middle meningeal artery supplies most of the blood for the dura mater, though the meningeal branches of the posterior and anterior ethmoidal artery also contribute.\\n\\nSensory innervation of the supratentorial dura mater is via small meningeal branches of the trigeminal nerve (V1, V2 and V3). The innervation for the infratentorial dura mater are upper cervical nerves.\\n\\nThe American Red Cross and some other agencies accepting blood donations consider dura mater transplant, along with receipt of pituitary-derived growth hormone, a risk factor due to concerns about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\\n\\nDural ectasia is the enlargement of the dura and is common in connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.\\n\\nSpontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak is the fluid and pressure loss of spinal fluid due to holes in the dura mater.\\n\\n<gallery><gallery><gallery>\\n\\n"}

Due to similarities in culture and language with the Kadazan ethnic group, a new unified term called \"Kadazan-Dusun\" was created. Collectively, they form the largest ethnic group in Sabah. A small minority of Dusuns can also be found in Brunei where they are defined by the constitution to be one of the seven Bumiputera groups.\\n\\nFor the majority of Dusuns, the word Dusun just means as it is i.e. Dusun people, without any references and implied meaning to any other words, be it from the Dusun language itself or any other languages. Coincidentally, Dusun is the Malay word that means \"orchard\" and is derived from \"Orang Dusun\" or \"men of the orchards\" as their houses are surrounded with fruit trees. A popular misconception is that the Dusun people named themselves (or were named) according to the Malay definition of the word Dusun. In actuality, even before the Malay language or British colonists had arrived in Sabah, the Dusun had long since called themselves by the name 'Dusun'. \\n\\nThe ethnic group, makes up, at one time, 30% of Sabah population and are broken down into more than 30 sub-ethnic, or dialectical groups, or tribes each speaking a slightly different dialect of the Dusunic family language. They are mostly mutually understandable.\\n\\nThe Dusun traded with the coastal people by bringing their agricultural produce to exchange for salt, salted fish, and other products. The name 'Dusun' was popularized by the British colonial masters who borrowed the term from the Brunei Malays.\\n\\nMost Dusuns have converted to mainstream religions such as Christian and Islam although animism is still being practiced by a small group of Dusun. The vast majority of Dusuns live in the hills and upland valleys and have a reputation for peacefulness, hospitality, hard work, frugality, drinking, and are averse to violence. Now they have very much been modernised and absorbed into the larger framework of the Malaysian society, taking up various occupations as government servants, and employees in the private sector, as well as becoming business owners. Many have achieved tertiary education both locally and overseas (in America, England, Australia and New Zealand).\\n\\nIn their old traditional setting they use various methods of fishing, including using the juice of the roots of a plant they call \"tuba\" to poison fish in rivers. \\n\\nDusuns are known as the Latin artists of the East, being famous in the state for love and passion for music. Their traditional dances appear attractive and gentle full of passion for life, making the Dusun culture a popular and beautiful one, and much sought by tourists to Sabah.\\n\\nEven though Dusuns are known for their peaceful nature, they are also well known for their bravery and defiant nature towards oppression and foreign rule. Warriors in the Marudu district (the most fearsome being Kulindod), and in Tuaran fought off attacks of enemies—Irranuns in Marudu, and Bruneians and Irranuns in Tuaran.\\n\\n"}

Nicknamed \"The Man with the Thousand-Watt Stare,\" and \"The Man of a Thousand Deaths,\" he specialized in the portrayal of mentally unbalanced characters, including his signature role, the madman Renfield in Tod Browning's 1931 version of Dracula. Later that same year he also played the hunchbacked assistant in the film Frankenstein. (This character, named Fritz, is often mistakenly referred to as Ygor, a character originated by Bela Lugosi in the later film Son of Frankenstein.) \\n\\nFrye had a prominent role in the 1933 horror film The Vampire Bat, starring Lionel Atwill, Melvyn Douglas, and Fay Wray, in which he played Herman, a half-wit suspected of being a killer. He also had a memorable role in the classic Bride of Frankenstein, in which he played Karl. The part of Karl was originally much longer and many extra scenes of Frye were shot as a sub plot but were edited out of the final version to shorten the running time as well as to appease the censor boards. The most memorable of these \"cut scenes\" was that of Karl killing the Burgomaster portrayed by E. E. Clive. No known prints of these scenes survive today, but photographs of the scene were used to illustrate the scene's synopsis and are included in the recent Universal DVD release of the film.\\n\\nDuring the early 1940s, Frye alternated between film roles and appearing on stage in a variety of productions ranging from comedies to musicals, as well as appearing in a stage version of Dracula. In 1924 he played the Son in a translation of Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author. There was a Dwight Frye Fan Club at one time, but it is currently dormant. He also made a contribution to the war effort by working nights as a tool designer for Lockheed Aircraft. Frye's strong resemblance to former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker helped land him what would have been a substantial role in the biographical film Wilson, based on the life of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, but he died of a heart attack while riding on a bus in Hollywood a few days before filming was to have begun.\\n\\nFrye was interred in Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dynamo", "body": "A dynamo (from the Greek word dynamis; meaning power), originally another name for an electrical generator, generally means a generator that produces direct current with the use of a commutator. Dynamos were the first electrical generators capable of delivering power for industry, and the foundation upon which many other later electric-power conversion devices were based, including the electric motor, the alternating-current alternator, and the rotary converter. They are rarely used for power generation now because of the dominance of alternating current, the disadvantages of the commutator, and the ease of converting alternating to direct current using solid state methods. \\n\\nThe word still has some regional usage as a replacement for the word generator. A small electrical generator built into the hub of a bicycle wheel to power lights is called a Hub dynamo, although these are invariably AC devices.\\n\\nThe dynamo uses rotating coils of wire and magnetic fields to convert mechanical rotation into a pulsing direct electric current through Faraday's law. A dynamo machine consists of a stationary structure, called the stator, which provides a constant magnetic field, and a set of rotating windings called the armature which turn within that field. The motion of the wire within the magnetic field causes the field to push on the electrons in the metal, creating an electric current in the wire. On small machines the constant magnetic field may be provided by one or more permanent magnet; larger machines have the constant magnetic field provided by one or more electromagnet, which are usually called field coils. \\n\\nThe commutator was needed to produce direct current. When a loop of wire rotates in a magnetic field, the potential induced in it reverses with each half turn, generating an alternating current. However, in the early days of electric experimentation, alternating current generally had no known use. The few uses for electricity, such as electroplating, used direct current provided by messy liquid batteries. Dynamos were invented as a replacement for batteries. The commutator is essentially a rotary switch. It consists of a set of contacts mounted on the machine's shaft, combined with graphite-block stationary contacts, called \"brushes\", because the earliest such fixed contacts were metal brushes. The commutator reverses the connection of the windings to the external circuit when the potential reverses, so instead of alternating current, a pulsing direct current is produced.\\n\\nthumbThe first electric generator was invented by Michael Faraday in 1831, a copper disk that rotated between the poles of a magnet. This was not a dynamo because it did not use a commutator. However, Faraday's disk generated very low voltage because of its single current path through the magnetic field. Faraday and others found that higher, more useful voltages could be produced by winding multiple turns of wire into a coil. Wire windings can conveniently produce any voltage desired by changing the number of turns, so they have been a feature of all subsequent generator designs, requiring the invention of the commutator to produce direct current. \\n\\nthumbthumbIn 1827, Hungarian Anyos Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic rotating devices which he called electromagnetic self-rotors. In the prototype of the single-pole electric starter, both the stationary and the revolving parts were electromagnetic. He formulated the concept of the dynamo about six years before Siemens and Wheatstone but did not patent it as he thought he was not the first to realize this. His dynamo used, instead of permanent magnets, two electromagnets opposite to each other to induce the magnetic field around the rotor.It was also the discovery of the principle of dynamo self-excitation.\\n\\nThe first dynamo based on Faraday's principles was built in 1832 by Hippolyte Pixii, a French instrument maker. It used a permanent magnet which was rotated by a crank. The spinning magnet was positioned so that its north and south poles passed by a piece of iron wrapped with insulated wire. Pixii found that the spinning magnet produced a pulse of current in the wire each time a pole passed the coil. However, the north and south poles of the magnet induced currents in opposite directions. To convert the alternating current to DC, Pixii invented a commutator, a split metal cylinder on the shaft, with two springy metal contacts that pressed against it.\\n\\nthumbThese early designs had a problem: the electric current they produced consisted of a series of \"spikes\" or pulses of current separated by none at all, resulting in a low average power output. As with electric motors of the period, the designers did not fully realize the seriously-detrimental effects of large air gaps in the magnetic circuit. Antonio Pacinotti, an Italian physics professor, solved this problem around 1860 by replacing the spinning two-pole axial coil with a multi-pole toroid one, which he created by wrapping an iron ring with a continuous winding, connected to the commutator at many equally spaced points around the ring; the commutator being divided into many segments. This meant that some part of the coil was continually passing by the magnets, smoothing out the current.\\n\\nThe first practical designs for a dynamo were announced independently and simultaneously by Dr. Werner Siemens and Charles Wheatstone. On January 17, 1867, Siemens announced to the Berlin academy a \"dynamo-electric machine\" (first use of the term) which employed self-powering electromagnetic field coils rather than permanent magnets to create the stator field. On the same day that this invention was announced to the Royal Society Charles Wheatstone read a paper describing a similar design with the difference that in the Siemens design the stator electromagnets were in series with the rotor, but in Wheatstone's design they were in parallel. The use of electromagnets rather than permanent magnets greatly increases the power output of a dynamo and enabled high power generation for the first time. This invention led directly to the first major industrial uses of electricity. For example, in the 1870s Siemens used electromagnetic dynamos to power electric arc furnace for the production of metals and other materials.\\n\\nthumbthumbZénobe Gramme reinvented Pacinotti's design in 1871 when designing the first commercial power plants, which operated in Paris in the 1870s. Another advantage of Gramme's design was a better path for the magnetic flux, by filling the space occupied by the magnetic field with heavy iron cores and minimizing the air gaps between the stationary and rotating parts. The Gramme dynamo was the first machine to generate commercial quantities of power for industry. Further improvements were made on the Gramme ring, but the basic concept of a spinning endless loop of wire remains at the heart of all modern dynamos.\\n\\nCharles F. Brush assembled his first dynamo in the summer of 1876 using a horse-drawn treadmill to power it. U.S. Patent #189997 \"Improvement in Magneto-Electric Machines\" was issued April 24, 1877. Brush started with the basic Gramme design where the wire on the sides and interior of the ring were outside the effective zone of the field and too much heat was retained. To improve upon this design, his ring armature was shaped like a disc rather than the cylinder shape of the Gramme armature. The field electromagnets were positioned on the sides of the armature disc rather than around the circumference. There were four electromagnets, two with north pole shoes and two with south pole shoes. The like poles opposed each other, one on each side of the disc armature. In 1881 one of The Brush Electric Company dynamos was reported to be; 89 inches long, 28 inches wide, and 36 inches in height, and weighs 4,800 pounds, and ran at a speed of about 700 revolutions per minute. It was believed to be the largest dynamo in the world at that time. Forty arc lights were fed by it, and it required 36 horse power.\\n\\nWhile not originally designed for the purpose, it was discovered that a dynamo can act as an electric motor when supplied with direct current from a battery or another dynamo. At an industrial exhibition in Vienna in 1873, Gramme noticed that the shaft of his dynamo began to spin when its terminals were accidentally connected to another dynamo producing electricity. Although this wasn't the first demonstration of an electric motor, it was the first practical one. It was found that the same design features which make a dynamo efficient also make a motor efficient. The efficient Gramme design, with small magnetic air gaps and many coils of wire attached to a many-segmented commutator, also became the basis for the design of all practical DC motors. \\n\\nLarge dynamos producing direct current were problematic in situations where two or more dynamos are working together and one has an engine running at a lower power than the other. The dynamo with the stronger engine will tend to drive the weaker as if it were a motor, against the rotation of the weaker engine. Such reverse-driving could feed back into the driving engine of a dynamo and cause a dangerous out of control reverse-spinning condition in the lower-power dynamo. It was eventually determined that when several dynamos all feed the same power source all the dynamos must be locked into synchrony using a jackshaft interconnecting all engines and rotors to counter these imbalances.\\n\\nAfter the discovery of the AC Generator and that alternating current can in fact be useful for something, the word dynamo became associated exclusively with the commutated DC electric generator, while an AC electrical generator using either slip ring or rotor magnets would become known as an alternator.\\n\\nAn AC electric motor using either slip rings or rotor magnets was referred to as a synchronous motor, and a commutated DC motor could also be called an electric motor though with the understanding that it could in principle operate as a generator.\\n\\nAfter dynamos and motors were found to allow easy conversion back and forth between mechanical or electrical power, they were combined in devices called rotary converters, rotating machines whose purpose was not to provide mechanical power to loads but to convert one type of electric current into another, for example DC into AC. They were multi-field single-rotor devices with two or more sets of rotating contacts (either commutators or sliprings, as required), one to provide power to one set of armature windings to turn the device, and one or more attached to other windings to produce the output current.\\n\\nThe rotary converter can directly convert, internally, any type of electric power into any other. This includes converting between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC), three phase and single phase power, 25 Hz AC and 60 Hz AC, or many different output voltages at the same time. The size and mass of the rotor was made large so that the rotor would act as a flywheel to help smooth out any sudden surges or dropouts in the applied power. Typical rotary converters were still used for the West Side IRT subway in Manhattanin the late 1960s, and possibly some years later. They were powered by 25 Hz AC, and provided DC at approx. 600 volts for the trains.\\n\\nThe technology of rotary converters was replaced in the early 20th century by mercury-vapor rectifiers, which were smaller, did not produce vibration and noise, and required less maintenance. The same conversion tasks are now performed by solid state power semiconductor device.\\n\\nDynamos still have some uses in low power applications, particularly where low voltage DC is required, since an alternator with a semiconductor rectifier can be inefficient in these applications. Hand cranked dynamos are used in clockwork radio, hand powered flashlights, mobile phone rechargers, and other human powered equipment to recharge batteries.\\n\\n"}

It is formed by Manuel de la Calva and Ramón Arcusa, singers, songwriters, record producers and actors. They were the main precursors of pop music in Spain.\\n\\nManolo and Ramón met when they were 16 years old, working as aeronautical engineering apprentices. The duo officially formed on December 28, 1958 in Barcelona. Their first performance before a live audience was on Radio Barcelona; they wanted to be called The Dynamic Boys, but the show host, Enrique Fernández, said he didn't speak English and introduced them as Dúo Dinámico, a name the musicians accepted. After that came more radio performances and a contract to sing at \"La Masía\", a famous restaurant in Barcelona, all while they still worked as engineers. Finally, in the summer of 1959 they quit their day jobs to dedicate themselves to their nascent music career.\\n\\nThey recorded their first EP in the fall of 1959, and it was a sales success. From then on, their ascent was spectacular, and they frequently topped the Spanish charts throughout the 60s with hits like \"Quince años tiene mi amor\", \"Quisiera ser\", \"Perdóname\", \"Bailando el twist\", \"Mari Carmen\", \"Esos ojitos negros\", \"Amor de verano\" or \"Mi chica de ayer\". They also starred in four films. Their popularity among Spanish music fans was comparable, if not superior, to the one achieved by The Beatles.\\n\\nThe Duo often participated in the various music festivals that took place in Spain at the time. They won the Mediterranean Song Festival in Barcelona in 1966 with \"Como Ayer\"; the Costa Verde Festival in Gijón with \"Somos Jóvenes\"; and they were twice second in the Benidorm International Song Festival, in 1962 and 1966, with \"Quisiera ser\" and \"Amor Amargo\". But their greatest achievement came as composers, when their song \"La, la, la\" won the 1968 Eurovision Song Contest, performed by Massiel. This was the first time that Spain won this festival, and the only time that Spain has been the sole winner (Spain won again in 1969, but tied with other three countries). The song was originally going to be performed by the duo's friend Joan Manuel Serrat, but he insisted in singing in Catalan, something that Franco's regime would not allow.\\n\\nAfter the sales failure of their 1972 album Mejor Que Nunca, recorded in London with the collaboration of George Martin, the duo decides to retire, but they keep composing for other artists such as Camilo Sesto and Nino Bravo, and producing for Julio Iglesias, Miguel Gallardo or José Vélez.\\n\\nDue to the continuing popularity of their songs, included in the soundtracks of many popular Spanish films and TV shows, and the insistence of various entrepreneurs, the duo made a comeback in 1978. A greatest hits album was released in 1980, and in 1986, they start to record new songs under a new contract with Sony Music. In 1987, one of them, \"Resistiré\", was included in the soundtrack of Pedro Almodóvar's film Átame. \\n\\nAs of 2007, the duo are still active, performing their hits in yearly live tours throughout Spain. \\n\\nOn September 21, 2007, the musical play Quisiera Ser, featuring 24 hits of the Dúo Dinámico, premiered at the Teatro Nuevo Apolo in Madrid.\\n\\n"}

It was followed by three sequels: Dōkyūsei 2 (Nanpa 2) and Kakyūsei (下級生, meaning Lower classmates), both of which were also very successful. There was a four-episode OAV made from Dōkyūsei, a 12-episode OAV was made from Dōkyūsei 2, and both an OAV and TV series from Kakyūsei. In 2004, ELF released the next in the series of games, Kakyūsei 2.\\n\\nA Game Boy Color mahjong game with Dōkyūsei 1 characters called Jankyusei (雀級生) was also created.The Dōkyūsei 2 expansion disk (Nanpa 2 Special), Dōkyūsei 2 SP, was also made into an OVA, this expansion is also referred to as Sotsugyōsei (卒業生, meaning The Graduate).\\n\\nThere is a persistent rumor of a Dōkyūsei 3 being planned by ELF, and a large fan demand for it. According to tinamix's review, Dōkyūsei 3 planning appeared on several eroge magazines after they had released Kakyusei. However, ELF seems to have no concern for it as of 2006, and Masato Hiruda, the great scenario writer of Dōkyūsei sequels, retired as CEO of ELF as well in 2000.\\n\\n\"Dokyusei\" is a Japanese word which means \"classmate\".

The ship is owned by the third-largest wind turbine manufacturer, Germany's Enercon GmbH. It will be used to transport wind turbine components. The E-Ship 1 is a Flettner ship: four large rotorsails that rise from its deck are rotated via a mechanical linkage to the ship's propellors. The sails, or Flettner rotors, aid the ship's propulsion by means of the Magnus effect—the perpendicular force that is exerted on a spinning body moving through a fluid stream.\\n\\nThe hull of E-Ship 1 was built by German shipbuilder Lindenau Werft in Kiel. The ship's launch took place on August 2, 2008, with the delivery date estimated for the first half of 2009. In September 2009, Lindenau-Werft declared insolvency. On January 25, 2009, it was announced that E-Ship 1 would be towed to and completed by German shipyard Cassens Werft in Emden.\\n\\nSteel construction work was completed in 2010, and the ship was docked at North Sea Works, where final construction took place with the ship in the water. In April 2010, the E-Ship 1 returned to Cassens Werft, where preparations were made for sea trials. The ship set off for a first sea trial from Emden to Bremerhaven on 6 July 2010. Three trial runs were completed until the end of July. The ship made its first voyage with cargo in August 2010, carrying nine turbines for Castledockrell Wind Farm from Emden to Dublin, Ireland.\\n\\nThe ship's bridge is located at the bow, and has three decks and two port-related long-boom cranes with payload capabilities of 80 and 120 tonnes. The ship has a rear ramp, and can function as a RoLo cargo ship. The vessel is 130 meters in length and 22.5 meters wide, with tonnage 12 800 dwt gt/10.000 approx. It is equipped with fore and aft maneuvering thrusters and has an Ice class GL E3 hull rating.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe E-Ship 1 is equipped with nine Mitsubishi marine diesel engines with a total output of 3.5 MW. The ship's exhaust gas boilers are connected to a Siemens downstream steam turbine, which in turn drives four Enercon-developed Flettner rotors. These rotors, resembling four large cylinders mounted on the ship's deck, are 27 meters tall and 4 meters in diameter. The Flettner drive allows for projected fuel savings of 30-40% at a speed of 16 knots. \\n\\n"}

Not only such a management facilitates detailed land records, it also has other direct and indirect gains like facilitating in decision-making processes in today's fast moving pace of corporatization of economic activities. In the absence of this, one faces high land-related litigation cases and issues of land ownerships along with other challenges. Such land management practices are still being explored in India and of late computerization of land records has emerged as a vital area wherein ICT can be deployed to enhance governance in administrative processes.\\n\\nSeveral such projects like the Bhoomi project in Karnataka are already being implemented in select cases. Dharitree is one such computerized land records management project being implemented in Sonitpur district of Assam. The project has gone beyond the pilot phase and is replicated gradually in the entire state. While Dharitree has facilitated governance pertaining to land related services, the pace of public participation is what further needs to be expedited.\\n\\nMain Objectives of Dharitree are i. To provide a Web-based land records computerization system for automation of land-based services, ii. Online mutation processes, iii. Up-to-date correction and maintenance of land records, iv. Online access to up-to-date land records for citizens, v. Quality and prompt delivery of citizen-centric services, vi. Maintaining land records data in the Chitha, and Jamabandi registers correctly, timely, and up-to-date, vii. Providing the land and revenue administration all the necessary MIS reports for faster monitoring, planning and decision making, viii. Making the land mutation processes faster, correct, automatic, and up-to-date through online mutations, ix. Supporting agriculture census by providing up-to-date crop/horticulture cultivation information, x.

These include: ectodermal dysplasia (systemic malformations of ectodermal tissues), ectrodactyly (\"lobster claw\" deformity in the hands and feet), macular dystrophy (a progressive eye disease), syndactyly (webbed fingers or toes),<refname=e01/> hypotrichosis (a type of hair-loss), and dental abnormalities (hypodontia).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nEEM syndrome is caused by mutation in the P-cadherin gene (CDH3). Distinct mutations in CDH3 (located on human chromosome 16) are responsible for the macular dystrophy and spectrum of malformations found in EEM syndrome, due in part to developmental errors caused by the resulting inability of CDH3 to respond correctly to the P-cadherin transcription factor p63. \\n\\nThe gene for p63 (TP73L, found on human chromosome 3) may also play a role in EEM syndrome. Mutations in this gene are associated with the symptoms of EEM and similar disorders, particularly ectrodactyly.\\n\\nEEM syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene - one from each parent - are required to inherit the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.\\n\\n"}

Environmental NGOs are organizations that are not run by federal or state governments but rather have funds issued to them by governments, private donors, corporations, and other institutions . In order to fully understand the social, economic, and environmental effects an organization can have on a region, it is important to note that the organization can act outside the formal processes that state governments and other government institutions must comply with.\\n\\nThe funds issued by various parties inevitably influence the way their efforts will be put out, the different kinds of environmental policy-making, and the activities pursued to challenge and put pressure on the states to cooperate in environmental protection . It is clear that private and non-private funding influences and affects the way environmental NGOs view and report environmental conditions.\\n\\nThe concept of what is local is crucial to the kinds of efforts and objectives environmental NGOs will carry out. This aim will aid how environmental NGOs will “facilitate, fund, promote, and provide planning and organizational assistance to so called grass roots organizations\" . Their efforts come in many forms such as: launching campaigns against nuclear weapons testing, protesting whale hunting, and \"international campaigns against the degradation of environmental goods caused by practices like \"clearing of timber, and criticize states for their ineffective policies or transnational corporations for environmentally damaging production\" . With political backup, environmental NGOs receive considerable amounts of assets and resources through government sponsors such as UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and CSD (Commission on Sustainable Development) among many others, who supersede environmental policies. Environmental NGOs have become increasingly aware of the loss of biodiversity in Africa and operate on conserving wild and domesticated animals and plants. By the 1980s, most of Zimbabwe's best land had been taken control of by European settlers which have been divided into categories of \"(1) large-scale commercial farm land.

In 2003, it became the first undergraduate degree to hold both EQUIS and AACSB accreditations.\\n\\nThe curriculum is 4 years long, and divided into two \"cycles\", of two years each. It allows for extensive professional exposure, and is concluded by a thesis.\\n\\nDuring the first two years, students take classes in subjects grouped into \"modules\": \"Management Science and Techniques\", \"Marketing and International Trade Development\", \"Economic and Legal Environements\", \"Personal Development and Entrepreneurship\" and \"Languages\". In the first year, students must spend 6 to 12 weeks interning in a position of customer service/ relation. At the end of their second year, they are required to spend at least 3 months interning in the company and position of their choice.\\n\\nAt the end of the First Cycle, students are matched with tutors who accompany them until they graduate. These tutors are volunteers, and are either Professors at ESSEC or alumni of the school. Their goal is to help students find their way through the career planning process.\\n\\nAlthough still based on the module system, the second and final half of the BBA is more flexible than the first, and is tailored to fit the needs and interests of each individual student. Three main paths are possible:\\n\\nDuring the Second Cycle, students have a choice of various electives, so as to pursue specific interests they may have.\\n\\nAfter original research is produced during the final months at EPSCI, the program is concluded by the defense of a senior thesis.\\n\\nMany EPSCI faculty members are also ESSEC MBA faculty members, and some teach at other top schools such as the Sorbonne, Université Paris-Dauphine, or Sciences Po Paris. Additionally, sixty professionals lead classes at EPSCI, giving valuable insight to students in their respective fields. Language teachers are all native speakers of the language they teach, and make up for 10 different nationalities.\\n\\nOver 30 years of existence, the program has distinguished itself by its exceptional international orientation. Students who graduate will have spent at least 1 year abroad, including at least a semester in one of the foreign partner schools, and at least a semester of work experience abroad.\\n\\nEPSCI has 77 partner universities in 30 different countries.\\n\\nSome of the most recognizable partners for exchanges are McGill University, Emory University, Keio University, Queen's University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, IE Business School, UNC Chapel Hill, Bocconi Milan, and UNSW Sydney.\\n\\nSeven dual-degrees are offered: Sheffield Hallam University, Hogeschool van Amsterdam, International Business School Groningen, Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics Moscow, ESIC Madrid, Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, and Tongji University Shanghai.\\n\\nEPSCI's partners are among the best institutions in their countries, and choosing a school in a country where one would want to start his or her professional career is a good way to further enhance a young graduate's competitiveness in the target job market.\\n\\nOne of the school's ambitions is to develop multilingual leaders. A total of nine different languages are taught at EPSCI.\\n\\nThree languages are mandatory: they include English for all students, either German or Spanish as second languages, and a choice between Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, Chinese and Japanese as third languages. A score of 850/990 points on the TOEIC is a pre-requisite for graduation. The TOEIC is taken on campus during the second year.\\n\\nThe German \"WIDaF\" and Spanish \"Bulats\" tests are also taken during the 2nd year of studies, but there is no minimal score required to obtain the degree. During the third year of studies, EPSCI students take several management courses in English with international exchange students.\\n\\nSome partner universities (especially those in the US and Canada) require students to obtain certain minimum scores on the TOEFL. Adequate preparation for this test is provided by EPSCI.\\n\\nESSEC has a very rich student culture, and EPSCI students are an integral part of it. From entrepreneurial to humanitarian, from cultural to sports-related, there are more than 100 student clubs at ESSEC, among which:\\n\\nThe work experience time required for graduation is typically 11 to 18 months. The extensive work experience required by the school allows students to find out what they really enjoy doing, start orienting their career paths, and be more competitive on the job market than graduates with lessprofessional experience under their belts.\\n\\nAfter graduation, 65% of alumni work abroad or in an international context, and 45% work in a position requiring three languages.\\n\\n30% continue their studies, of which 12% choose to join an MBA.\\n\\nOf all BBA students who apply for a Specialized Master program at ESSEC after EPSCI, 70% are admitted. Naturally, students may also apply to enter the ESSEC MBA program.\\n\\nEPSCI students seeking postgraduate education outside ESSEC have historically joined prestigious French schools such as Université Paris-Dauphine, EM Lyon, Sciences-Po, or the Ecole des Mines de Paris, and major foreign schools like the London School of Economics, the Bocconi Milan, the London Business School, or McGill University.\\n\\nAmong French undergraduate business programs, EPSCI was ranked:\\n\\nIt is indeed most often ranked as the best Bachelor-level business program in France.\\n\\nIn field-specific rankings, EPSCI is sometimes ranked higher than traditionally more prestigious \"Grandes écoles\" (master-level, and accessible after preparatory classes).\\n\\nFor example, in 2009 it was ranked the 6th best business school in France for Marketing, higher than EM Lyon, EDHEC and Audencia, among others.\\n\\nIn the same ranking, its research in the Marketing field obtained marks much higher than those of the top Grandes écoles, including HEC Paris and the ESCP.\\n\\nThe admission process is primarily carried out right out of secondary school. Admissions to the ESSEC BBA program are made through the competitive Concours SESAME, an examination common to 7 different French business schools.\\n\\nThe test first evaluates language skills, logic (quantitative and general), and capacity for analysis during an 8-hour written session. If the candidate is successful, (s)he then has to pass a series of graded interviews conducted at the school (conversations in the chosen foreign languages, and a general interview).\\n\\nAdmissions to EPSCI are highly selective: in 2008, the acceptance rate was slightly over 4.2% (~185 students admitted out of ~4,800 candidates).\\n\\nIt is also possible to join EPSCI later on in one's studies, as a transfer student, although this is much rarer.\\n\\nEPSCI is part of the ESSEC Business School network, which boasts 32,000 alumni.

{"title": "Earlobe", "body": "The earlobe is composed of tough areolar and adipose (fatty) connective tissue, lacking the firmness and elasticity of the rest of the pinna. Since the earlobe does not contain cartilage it has a large blood supply and may help to warm the ears and maintain balance. However earlobes are not generally considered to have any major biological function.\\n\\nEarlobes average about 2 cm long, and elongate slightly with age. Whether the earlobe is free or attached is a classic example of a simple genetic dominance relationship; freely hanging earlobes are the dominant allele and attached earlobes are recessive. Therefore, a person whose genes contain one allele for free earlobes and one for attached lobes will display the freely hanging lobe trait. It is a common misconception that this implies a precise 3-to-1 ratio between free and attached lobes in the human population. Such a ratio would require that the allele frequency for free lobes were precisely 50%, which there is no reason to assume. The frequency of attached earlobes among Japanese subjects is 67.1%, and in Chinese it is 64.3%.\\n\\nright are normally smooth, but occasionally exhibit creases. Creased earlobes are associated with genetic disorders, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Earlobe creases are also associated with an increased risk of heart attack and coronary heart disease; however, since earlobes become more creased with age, and older people are more likely to experience heart disease than younger people, age may account for the findings linking heart attack to earlobe creases. however, this correlation proved to be untrue in persons of Asian descent (Chinese and Japanese) and Native American Indians. See Frank's Sign.\\n\\nThe earlobe contains many nerve ending, and for some people is an erogenous zone.\\n\\nleftAround the world and throughout human history, the earlobe is the most common location for a body piercing. It is common to tear the earlobe with the weight of very heavy earring, or a traumatic pull of an earring. Some cultures practice earlobe stretching, using piercing ornaments to stretch and enlarge the earlobes. Sailors used to believe that piercing one earlobe gave greater acuity in the opposite ear. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Early modern France", "body": "Early modern France is the early modern period of French history from the end of the 15th century to the end of the 18th century (or from the French Renaissance to the climax of the French Revolution). During this period France evolved from a feudal regime to an increasingly centralized state (albeit with many regional differences) organized around a powerful absolute monarchy that relied on the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings and the explicit support of the established Church.\\n\\nthumbIn the mid 15th century, France was significantly smaller than it is today, and numerous border provinces (such as Roussillon, Cerdagne, Calais, Béarn, Navarre, County of Foix, Flanders, Artois, Lorraine, Alsace, Trois-Évêchés, Franche-Comté, Savoy, Bresse, Bugey, Gex, Nice, Provence, and Brittany) were autonomous or foreign-held (as by England); there were also foreign enclaves, like the Comtat Venaissin. In addition, certain provinces within France were ostensibly personal fiefdoms of noble families (like the Bourbonnais, Marche, Forez and Auvergne provinces held by the House of Bourbon until the provinces were forcibly integrated into the royal domaine in 1527 after the fall of the Charles III, Duke of Bourbon).\\n\\nThe late 15th, 16th and 17th centuries would see France undergo a massive territorial expansion and an attempt to better integrate its provinces into an administrative whole. During this period, France expanded to nearly its modern territorial extent through the acquisition of Picardy, Burgundy, Anjou, Maine, Provence, Brittany, Franche-Comté, French Flanders, Navarre, Roussillon, the Duchy of Lorraine, Alsace and Corsica.\\n\\nFrench acquisitions from 1461-1789:\\n\\nOnly the Duchy of Savoy, the city of Nice and some other small papal (e.g., Avignon) and foreign possessions would be acquired later. (For a map of historic French provinces, see Provinces of France). France also embarked on exploration, colonisation, and mercantile exchanges with the Americas (New France, Louisiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Haiti, French Guiana), India (Puducherry), the Indian Ocean (Réunion), the Far East, and a few African trading posts.\\n\\nAlthough Paris was the capital of France, the later Valois kings largely abandoned the city as their primary residence, preferring instead various châteaux of the Loire Valley and Parisian countryside. Henry IV made Paris his primary residence (promoting a major building boom in private mansions), but Louis XIV once again withdrew from the city in the last decades of his reign and Versailles became the primary seat of the French monarchy for much of the following century.\\n\\nThe administrative and legal system in France in this period is generally called the Ancien Régime.\\n\\nThe Black Death had killed an estimated one-third of the population of France from its appearance in 1348. The concurrent Hundred Years' War slowed recovery. It would be the early 16th century before the population recovered to mid-14th century levels. \\n\\nWith an estimated population of 11 million in 1400, 20 million in the 17th century, and 28 million in 1789, until 1795 France was the most populated country in Europe (even ahead of Russia and twice the size of Britain or the Netherlands) and the third most populous country in the world, behind only China and India.\\n\\nThese demographic changes also led to a massive increase in urban populations, although on the whole France remained a profoundly rural country. Paris was one of the most populated cities in Europe (estimated at 400,000 inhabitants in 1550; 650,000 at the end of the 18th century). Other major French cities include Lyon, Rouen, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Marseille. \\n\\nThese centuries saw several periods of epidemics and crop failures due to wars and climatic change. (Historians speak of the period 1550–1850 as the \"Little Ice Age\".) Between 1693 and 1694, France lost 6% of its population. In the extremely harsh winter of 1709, France lost 3.5% of its population. In the past 300 years, no period has been so proportionally deadly for the French, both World Wars included.\\n\\nLinguistically, the differences in France were extreme. Before the Renaissance, the language spoken in the north of France was a collection of different dialects called Oïl languages whereas the written and administrative language remained Latin. By the 16th century there had developed a standardised form of French (called Middle French) which would be the basis of the standardised \"modern\" French of the 17th and 18th century which in turn became the lingua franca of the European continent. (In 1539, with the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, Francis I of France made French alone the language for legal and juridical acts.) Nevertheless, in 1790, perhaps 50% of the French population did not speak or understand standard French. The southern half of the country continued to speak Occitan language (such as Provençal), and other inhabitants spoke Breton, Catalan, Basque, Dutch (West Flemish), and Franco-Provençal. In the north of France, regional dialects of the various langues d'oïl continued to be spoken in rural communities.France would not become a linguistically unified country until the end of the 19th century.\\n\\nThe Ancien Régime, a French term rendered in English as \"Old Rule\", \"Old Kingdom\", or simply \"Old Regime\", refers primarily to the aristocratic, social and political system established in France from (roughly) the 15th century to the 18th century under the late Valois and Bourbon dynasties. The administrative and social structures of the Ancien Régime were the result of years of state-building, legislative acts (like the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts), internal conflicts and civil wars, but they remained a confusing patchwork of local privilege and historic differences until the French Revolution brought about a radical suppression of administrative incoherence.\\n\\nThe Peace of Etaples (1492) marks, for some, the beginning of the early modern period in France.\\n\\nAfter the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) and the Treaty of Picquigny (1475) – its official end date – in 1492 and 1493, Charles VIII of France signed three additional treaties with Henry VII of England, Maximilian I of Habsburg, and Ferdinand II of Aragon respectively at Étaples (1492), Senlis (1493) and in Barcelona (1493). These three treaties cleared the way for France to undertake the long Italian Wars (1494–1559), which marked the beginning of early modern France.\\n\\nDespite the beginnings of rapid demographic and economic recovery after the Black Death of the 14th century, the gains of the previous half-century were to be jeopardised by a further protracted series of conflicts, the Italian Wars (1494–1559), where French efforts to gain dominance ended in the increased power of the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperors of Germany.\\n\\nLudovico Sforza, seeking an ally against the Republic of Venice, encouraged Charles VIII of France to invade Italy, using the Angevin claim to the throne of Naples, then under Aragon control, as a pretext. When Ferdinand I of Naples died in 1494, Charles invaded the peninsula. For several months, French forces moved through Italy virtually unopposed, since the condottieri armies of the Italian city-state were unable to resist them. Their sack of Naples finally provoked a reaction, however, and the League of Venice was formed against them. Italian troops defeated the French at the Battle of Fornovo, forcing Charles to withdraw to France. Ludovico, having betrayed the French at Fornovo, retained his throne until 1499, when Charles's successor, Louis XII of France, invaded Lombardy and seized Milan.\\n\\nIn 1500, Louis, having reached an agreement with Ferdinand II of Aragon to divide Naples, marched south from Milan. By 1502, combined French and Aragonese forces had seized control of the Kingdom; disagreements about the terms of the partition led to a war between Louis and Ferdinand. By 1503, Louis, having been defeated at the Battle of Cerignola and Battle of the Garigliano, was forced to withdraw from Naples, which was left under the control of the Spanish viceroy, Ramon de Cardona. French forces under Gaston de Foix inflicted an overwhelming defeat on a Spanish army at the Battle of Ravenna in 1512, but Foix was killed during the battle, and the French were forced to withdraw from Italy by an invasion of Milan by the Swiss, who reinstated Maximilian Sforza to the ducal throne. The Holy League, left victorious, fell apart over the subject of dividing the spoils, and in 1513 Venice allied with France, agreeing to partition Lombardy between them.\\n\\nLouis mounted another invasion of Milan, but was defeated at the Battle of Novara, which was quickly followed by a series of Holy League victories at La Motta, Guinegate, and Flodden Field, in which the French, Venetian, and Scottish forces were decisively defeated. However, the death of Pope Julius left the League without effective leadership, and when Louis' successor, Francis I, defeated the Swiss at Marignano in 1515, the League collapsed, and by the treaties of Noyon and Brussels, surrendered to France and Venice the entirety of northern Italy.\\n\\nThe elevation of Charles of Spain to Holy Roman Emperor, a position that Francis had desired, led to a collapse of relations between France and the Habsburgs. In 1519, a Spanish invasion of Navarre, nominally a French fief, provided Francis with a pretext for starting a general war; French forces flooded into Italy and began a campaign to drive Charles from Naples. The French were outmatched, however, by the fully-developed Spanish tercio tactics, and suffered a series of crippling defeats at Bicocca and Sesia against Spanish troops under Fernando de Avalos. With Milan itself threatened, Francis personally led a French army into Lombardy in 1525, only to be defeated and captured at the Battle of Pavia; imprisoned in Madrid, Francis was forced to agree to extensive concessions over his Italian territories in the \"Treaty of Madrid\" (1526).thumb\\n\\nThe inconclusive third war between Charles and Francis began with the death of Francesco Maria Sforza, the duke of Milan. When Charles' son Philip inherited the duchy, Francis invaded Italy, capturing Turin, but failed to take Milan. In response, Charles invaded Provence, advancing to Aix-en-Provence, but withdrew to Spain rather than attacking the heavily fortified Avignon. The Truce of Nice ended the war, leaving Turin in French hands but effecting no significant change in the map of Italy. Francis, allying himself with Suleiman I of the Ottoman Empire, launched a final invasion of Italy. A Franco-Ottoman fleet captured the city of Nice in August 1543, and laid siege to the citadel. The defenders were relieved within a month. The French, under François, Count d'Enghien, defeated an Imperial army at the Battle of Ceresole in 1544, but the French failed to penetrate further into Lombardy. Charles and Henry VIII of England then proceeded to invade northern France, seizing Boulogne and Soissons. A lack of cooperation between the Spanish and English armies, coupled with increasingly aggressive Ottoman attacks, led Charles to abandon these conquests, restoring the status quo once again.\\n\\nIn 1547, Henry II of France, who had succeeded Francis to the throne, declared war against Charles with the intent of recapturing Italy and ensuring French, rather than Habsburg, domination of European affairs. An early offensive against Lorraine was successful, but the attempted French invasion of Tuscany in 1553 was defeated at the Battle of Marciano. Charles's abdication in 1556 split the Habsburg empire between Philip II of Spain and Ferdinand I, and shifted the focus of the war to Flanders, where Philip, in conjunction with Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy, defeated the French at St. Quentin. England's entry into the war later that year led to the French capture of Calais, England's last possession on the French mainland, and French armies plundered Spanish possessions in the Low Countries; but Henry was nonetheless forced to accept the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, in which he renounced any further claims to Italy.\\n\\nBarely were the Italian Wars over, when France was plunged into a domestic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Despite the conclusion of a Concordat between France and the Papacy (1516), granting the crown unrivalled power in senior ecclesiastical appointments, France was deeply affected by the Protestant Reformation's attempt to break the unity of Roman Catholic Europe. A growing urban-based Protestant minority (later dubbed Huguenots) faced ever harsher repression under the rule of Francis I's son King Henry II. After Henry II's unfortunate death in a joust, the country was ruled by his widow Catherine de' Medici and her sons Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III. Renewed Catholic reaction headed by the powerful dukes of Guise culminated in a massacre of Huguenots (1562), starting the first of the French Wars of Religion, during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces. Opposed to absolute monarchy, the Huguenots Monarchomachs theorized during this time the right of rebellion and the legitimacy of tyrannicide.\\n\\nThe Wars of Religion culminated in the War of the Three Henrys in which Henry III assassinated Henry de Guise, leader of the Spanish-backed Catholic league, and the king was murdered in return. After the assassination of both Henry of Guise (1588) and Henry III (1589), the conflict was ended by the accession of the Protestant king of Navarre as Henry IV (first king of the Bourbon dynasty) and his subsequent abandonment of Protestantism (Expedient of 1592) effective in 1593, his acceptance by most of the Catholic establishment (1594) and by the Pope (1595), and his issue of the toleration decree known as the Edict of Nantes (1598), which guaranteed freedom of private worship and civil equality.\\n\\nthumbFrance's pacification under Henry IV laid much of the ground for the beginnings of France's rise to European hegemony. One of the most admired French kings, Henry was fatally stabbed by a Catholic fanatic in 1610 as war with Spain threatened. Troubles gradually developed during the regency headed by his queen Marie de Medici. France was expansive during all but the end of the 17th century: the French began trading in India and Madagascar, founded Quebec and penetrated the North American Great Lakes and Mississippi, established plantation economies in the West Indies and extended their trade contacts in the Levant and enlarged their merchant marine.\\n\\nHenry IV's son Louis XIII and his minister (1624–1642) Cardinal Richelieu, elaborated a policy against Spain and the German emperor during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) which had broken out among the lands of Germany's Holy Roman Empire. An English-backed Huguenot rebellion (1625–1628) defeated, France intervened directly (1635) in the wider European conflict following her ally (Protestant) Sweden's failure to build upon initial success.\\n\\nAfter the death of both king and cardinal, the Peace of Westphalia (1648) secured universal acceptance of Germany's political and religious fragmentation, but the Regency of Anne of Austria and her minister Cardinal Mazarin experienced a civil uprising known as the Fronde (1648–1653) which expanded into a Franco-Spanish War (1653–1659). The Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) formalised France's seizure (1642) of the Spanish territory of Roussillon after the crushing of the ephemeral Catalan Republic and ushered a short period of peace.\\n\\nFor most of the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715), France was the dominant power in Europe, aided by the diplomacy of Richelieu's successor (1642–1661) Cardinal Mazarin and the economic policies (1661–1683) of Colbert. Colbert's attempts to promote economic growth and the creation of new industries were not a great success, and France did not undergo any sort of industrial revolution during Louis XIV's reign. In fact, the king's foreign policy, as well as his lavish court and construction projects, left the country in enormous debt. The Palace of Versailles was criticized as overly extravagant even while it was still under construction, but dozens of imitations were built across Europe. Renewed war (the War of Devolution 1667-1668 and the Franco-Dutch War 1672-1678) brought further territorial gains (Artois and western Flanders and the free county of Burgundy, left to the Empire in 1482), but at the cost of the increasingly concerted opposition of rival powers.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nFrench culture was part of French hegemony. In the early part of the century French painters had to go to Rome to shed their provinciality (Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain), but Simon Vouet brought home the taste for a classicized baroque that would characterise the French Baroque, epitomised in the Académie de peinture et de sculpture, in the painting of Charles Le Brun and the sculpture of François Girardon. With the Palais du Luxembourg, the Château de Maisons and Vaux-le-Vicomte, French classical architecture was admired abroad even before the creation of Versailles or Perrault's Louvre colonnade. Parisian salon culture set standards of discriminating taste from the 1630s, and with Pascal, Descartes, Bayle, Corneille, Racine and Molière, France became the cultural center of Europe. The king sought to impose total religious uniformity on the country, repealing the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The infamous practice of dragonnades was adopted, whereby rough soldiers were quartered in the homes of Protestant families and allowed to have their way with them. Scores of Protestants fled France, costing the country a great many intellectuals, artisans, and other valuable people. Persecution extended to unorthodox Catholics like the Jansenists, a group that denied free will and had already been condemned by the popes. Louis was no theologian and understood little of the complex doctrines of Jansenism, satisfying himself with the fact that they threatened the unity of the state. In this, he garnered the friendship of the papacy, which had previously been hostile to France because of its policy of putting all church property in the country under the jurisdiction of the state rather than of Rome.\\n\\nCardinal Mazarin oversaw the creation of a French navy that rivaled England's, expanding it from 25 ships to almost 200. The size of the army was also considerably increased.\\n\\nStarting in the 1670s, Louis XIV established the so-called \"Chambers of Reunion\", courts in which judges would determine whether certain Habsburg territories belonged rightfully to France. The king was relying on the somewhat vague wording in the Treaty of Westphalia, while also dredging up older French claims, some dating back to medieval times. Through this, he concluded that the strategically important imperial city of Strassburg should have gone to France in 1648. In September 1681, French troops occupied the city, which was at once strongly fortified. As the imperial armies were then busy fighting the Ottoman Empire, they could not do anything about this for a number of years. The basic aim of Louis' foreign policy was to give France more easily defensible borders, and to eliminate weak spots (Strassburg had often been used by the Habsburgs as a gateway into France).\\n\\nFollowing the Whig establishment on the English and Scottish thrones by the Dutch prince William of Orange in 1688, the anti-French \"Grand Alliance\" of 1689 was established. With the Turks now in retreat, the emperor Leopold could turn his attention to France. The ensuing War of the Grand Alliance lasted from 1688-1697. France's resources were stretched to the breaking point by the cost of fielding an army of over 300,000 men and two naval squadrons. Famine in 1692-1693 killed up to two million people. The exhaustion of the powers brought the fighting to an end in 1697, by which time the French were in control of the Spanish Netherlands and Catalonia. However, Louis gave back his conquests and only gained the island of Haiti. The French people, feeling that their sacrifices in the war had been for nothing, never forgave him.\\n\\nThe Battle of La Hougue (1692) was the decisive naval battle in the war and confirmed the durable dominance of the Royal Navy of England.\\n\\nIn November 1700, the inbred, mentally retarded, and enfeebled Spanish king Charles II died, ending the Habsburg line in that country. Louis had long waited for this moment, and now planned to put a Bourbon relative, Philip, Duke of Anjou, on the throne. Essentially, Spain was to become an obedient satellite of France, ruled by a king who would carry out orders from Versailles. Realizing how this would upset the balance of power, the other European rulers were outraged. However, most of the alternatives were equally undesirable. For example, putting another Habsburg on the throne would end up recreating the empire of Charles V, which would also grossly upset the power balance. After nine years of exhausting war, the last thing Louis wanted was another conflict. However, the rest of Europe would not stand for his ambitions in Spain, and so the War of the Spanish Succession began, a mere three years after the War of the Grand Alliance.\\n\\nThe disasters of the war (accompanied by another famine) were so great that France was on the verge of collapse by 1709. In desperation, the king appealed to the French people to save their country, and in doing so gained thousands of new army recruits. Afterwards, his general Marshal Villars managed to drive back the allied forces. In 1714, the war ended with the treaties of Utrecht and Rastadt. France did not lose any territory, and there was no discussion of returning Flanders or Alsace to the Habsburgs. While the Duke of Anjou was accepted as King Philip V of Spain, this was done under the condition that the French and Spanish thrones never be united. Finally, France agreed to stop supporting Jacobite pretenders to the English throne. Just after the war ended, Louis died, having ruled France for 72 years.\\n\\nThe reign (1715–1774) of Louis XV saw an initial return to peace and prosperity under the regency (1715–1723) of Philip II, Duke of Orléans, whose policies were largely continued (1726–1743) by Cardinal Fleury, prime minister in all but name. The exhaustion of Europe after two major wars resulted in a long period of peace, only interrupted by minor conflicts like the War of the Polish Succession from 1733-1735. Large-scale warfare resumed with the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). But alliance with the traditional Habsburg enemy (the \"Diplomatic Revolution\" of 1756) against the rising power of Britain and Prussia led to costly failure in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) and the loss of France's North American colonies. \\n\\nthumb\\n\\nOn the whole, the 18th century saw growing discontent with the monarchy and the established order. Louis XV was a highly unpopular king for his sexual excesses, overall weakness, and for losing Canada to the British. A strong ruler like Louis XIV could enhance the position of the monarchy, while Louis XV weakened it. The writings of the philosophes such as Voltaire were a clear sign of discontent, but the king chose to ignore them. He died of smallpox in 1774, and the French people shed few tears at his passing. While France had not yet experienced the industrial revolution that was beginning in England, the rising middle class of the cities felt increasingly frustrated with a system and rulers that seemed silly, frivolous, aloof, and antiquated, even if true feudalism no longer existed in France.\\n\\nUpon Louis XV's death, his grandson Louis XVI became king. Initially popular, he too came to be widely detested by the 1780s. Again a weak ruler, he was married to an Austrian archduchess, Marie Antoinette, whose naivety and cloistered/alienated Versailles life permitted ignorance of the true extravagance and wasteful use of borrowed money (however, it should be noted that Marie Antoinette was significantly more frugal than her predecessors). French intervention in the US War of Independence was also very expensive.\\n\\nWith the country deeply in debt, Louis XVI permitted the radical reforms of Turgot and Malesherbes, but noble disaffection led to Turgot's dismissal and Malesherbes' resignation in 1776. They were replaced by Jacques Necker. Necker had resigned in 1781 to be replaced by Calonne and Brienne, before being restored in 1788. A harsh winter that year led to widespread food shortages, and by then France was a powder keg ready to explode.\\n\\nOn the eve of the French Revolution of 1789, France was in a profound institutional and financial crisis, but the ideas of the Enlightenment had begun to permeate the educated classes of society.\\n\\nOn 1792 September 21 the French monarchy was effectively abolished by the proclamation of the French First Republic.\\n\\nAfter Charles VIII the Affable, the last king in the direct Valois line, three other branches of the House of Capet reigned in France until the fall of the Ancien Régime in 1792:\\n\\nValois-Orléans (1498–1515)\\n\\nValois-Angoulême (1515–1589)\\n\\nHouse of Bourbon (1589–1792)\\n\\nFrance\\n\\n"}

It affects approximately one-third of the global population, and the countries China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, etc. It is driven by temperature differences between the Asia continent and the Pacific Ocean. The East Asian monsoon is divided into a warm and wet summer monsoon and a cold and dry winter monsoon. This cold and dry winter monsoon is responsible for the aeolian dust deposition and pedogenesis that resulted in the creation of the Loess Plateau.\\n\\nIn most years, the monsoonal flow shifts in a very predictable pattern, with winds being southwesterly in late June, bringing significant rainfall to the Korean peninsula and Japan. This leads to a reliable precipitation spike in July and August. However, this pattern occasionally fails, leading to drought and crop failure. In the winter, the winds are northeasterly and the monsoonal precipitation bands move back to the south, and intense precipitation occurs over southern China and Taiwan.\\n\\nThe East Asian monsoon is known as jangma (장마) in Korea. In Japan the monsoon boundary is referred to as the bai-u as it advances northward during the spring, while it is referred to as the shurin when the boundary retreats back southward during the autumn months. Over Japan and Korea, the monsoon boundary typically takes the form of a quasi-stationary front separating the cooler air mass associated with the Okhotsk High to the north from the hot, humid air mass associated with the subtropical ridge to the south.

{"title": "Easter egg", "body": "thumb\\n\\nEaster eggs or spring eggs are special egg that are often given to celebrate Easter or springtime.\\n\\nThe egg is a pagan symbol of the rebirth of the Earth in celebrations of spring and was adopted by early Christians as a symbol of the resurrection of Jesus.\\n\\nThe oldest tradition is to use dyed or painted chicken eggs, but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as jelly bean. These eggs are often hidden, allegedly by the Easter Bunny, for children to find on Easter morning. Otherwise, they are generally put in a basket filled with real or artificial straw to resemble a bird's nest.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumb\\n\\nThe egg is widely used as a symbol of the start of new life, just as new life emerges from an egg when the chick hatches out. \\n\\nThe ancient Zoroastrians painted eggs for Nowrooz, their New Year celebration, which falls on the Spring equinox. The Nawrooz tradition has existed for at least 2,500 years. The sculptures on the walls of Persepolis show people carrying eggs for Nowrooz to the king. \\n\\nAt the Jewish Passover Seder, a hard-boiled egg dipped in salt water symbolizes the festival sacrifice offered at the Temple in Jerusalem.\\n\\nThere are good grounds for the association between hare (later termed Easter bunnies) and eggs, through folklore confusion between hares' forms (where they raise their young) and plover' nests. Furthermore, the hare has been commonly associated with springtime seasonal celebrations since antiquity by northern European pagans.\\n\\nthumbThe egg is seen by followers of christianity as a symbol of resurrection: while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it.\\n\\nIn the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, Easter eggs are dyed red to represent the blood of Christ, shed on the Cross, and the hard shell of the egg symbolized the sealed Tomb of Christ—the cracking of which symbolized his resurrection from the dead. Easter eggs are blessed by the priest at the end of the Paschal Vigil, and distributed to the faithful. Each household also brings an Easter basket to church, filled not only with Easter eggs but also with other Paschal foods such as paskha, kulich or Easter bread, and these are blessed by the priest as well. \\n\\nDuring Paschaltide, in some traditions the Paschal greeting with the Easter egg is even extended to the deceased. On either the second Monday or Tuesday of Pascha, after a memorial service people bring blessed eggs to the cemetery and bring the joyous paschal greeting, \"Christ has risen\", to their beloved departed (see Radonitza).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nWhile the origin of easter eggs can be explained in the symbolic terms described above, a pious legend among followers of Eastern Christianity says that Mary Magdalene was bringing cooked eggs to share with the other women at the tomb of Jesus, and the eggs in her basket miraculously turned brilliant red when she saw the risen Christ.The egg represents the boulder of the tomb of Jesus.\\n\\nA different, but not necessarily conflicting legend concerns Mary Magdalene's efforts to spread the Gospel. According to this tradition, after the Ascension of Jesus, Mary went to the Emperor of Rome and greeted him with \"Christ has risen,\" whereupon he pointed to an egg on his table and stated, \"Christ has no more risen than that egg is red.\" After making this statement it is said the egg immediately turned blood red.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumbEaster eggs are a widely popular symbol of new life in Bulgaria, Russia, Romania, Ukraine, Poland and other Slavic countries' folk traditions. A batik (wax resist) process is used to create intricate, brilliantly-colored eggs., the best-known of which is the Ukrainian pysanka. The celebrated Fabergé workshops created exquisite jewelled Easter eggs for the Russian Imperial Court. Most of these creations themselves contained hidden surprises such as clock-work birds, or miniature ships. A 27-foot (9 m) sculpture of a pysanka stands in Vegreville, Alberta.\\n\\nThere are many other decorating techniques and numerous traditions of giving them as a token of friendship, love or good wishes. A tradition exists in some parts of the United Kingdom (such as Scotland and North East England) of rolling painted eggs down steep hill on Easter Sunday. In the U.S., such an Easter egg roll (unrelated to an eggroll) is often done on flat ground, pushed along with a spoon; the Easter Egg Roll has become a much-loved annual event on the White House lawn. An Easter egg hunt is a common festive activity, where eggs are hidden outdoors (or indoors if in bad weather) for children to run around and find. This may also be a contest to see who can collect the most eggs.\\n\\nWhen boiling hard-cooked eggs for Easter, a popular tan colour can be achieved by boiling the eggs with onion skins. A greater variety of colour was often provided by tying on the onion skin with different coloured woollen yarn. In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, from a dialectal form of Middle English pasche. They were usually eaten after an egg-jarping (egg-tapping) competition.\\n\\nleftleftEgg hunt is a game during which decorated egg, real hard-boiled ones or artificial ones filled with, or made of chocolate candies, of various sizes, are hidden for children to find, both indoors and outdoors. \\n\\nWhen the hunt is over, prizes may be given for the largest number of eggs collected, or for the largest or the smallest egg.\\n\\nReal eggs may further be used in egg tapping contests.\\n\\nIn the North of England, at Eastertime, a traditional game is played where hard boiled pace eggs are distributed and each player hits the other player's egg with their own. This is known as \"egg tapping\", \"egg dumping\" or \"egg jarping\". The winner is the holder of the last intact egg. The losers get to eat their eggs. The annual egg jarping world championship is held every year over Easter in Peterlee Cricket Club. It is also practiced in Bulgaria, Hungary, Croatia, Lithuania, Lebanon, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, and other countries. They call it tucanje. In parts of Austria, Bavaria and German-speaking Switzerland it is called Ostereiertitschen or Eierpecken. In parts of Europe it is also called epper, presumably from the German name Opfer, meaning \"offering\" and in Greece it is known as tsougrisma. In South Louisiana this practice is called Pocking Eggs and is slightly different. The Cajun hold that the winner eats the eggs of the losers in each round.\\n\\nThe central European Slavic nations (Czechs and Slovaks etc.) have a tradition of gathering eggs by gaining them from the females in return of whipping them with a pony-tail shaped whip made out of fresh willow branches and splashing them with water, by the Ruthenian called polivanja, which is supposed to give them health and beauty.\\n\\nEgg rolling is also a traditional Easter egg game played with eggs at Easter. In England, Germany, and other countries children traditionally rolled eggs down hillsides at Easter. This tradition was taken to the New World by European settlers, and continues to this day each Easter on the White House lawn.\\n\\nDifferent nations have different versions of the game.\\n\\nEgg dance is a traditional Easter game in which eggs are laid on the ground or floor and the goal is to dance among them without damaging any eggs which originated in Germany. In the UK the dance is called the hop-egg.\\n\\nThe Pace Egg play are traditional village plays, with a rebirth theme. The drama takes the form of a combat between the hero and villain, in which the hero is killed and brought to life, The plays take place in England during Easter.\\n\\nIn some Mediterranean countries, especially in Lebanon, chicken eggs are boiled and decorated by dye and/or painting and used as decoration around the house. Then, on Easter Day, young kids would duel with them saying 'Christ is resurrected, Indeed He is', breaking and eating them.\\n\\nthumbThe Easter egg tradition may also have merged into the celebration of the end of the privations of Lent in the West. Historically, it was traditional to use up all of the household's eggs before Lent began. Eggs were originally forbidden during Lent as well as on other traditional fast days in Western Christianity (this tradition still continues among the Eastern Christian Churches).Likewise, in Eastern Christianity, both meat and dairy are prohibited during the Lenten fast, and eggs are seen as \"dairy\" (a foodstuff that could be taken from an animal without shedding its blood) . This established the tradition of Pancake Day being celebrated on Shrove Tuesday. This day, the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday Lent begins is also known as Mardi Gras, a French phrase which translates as \"Fat Tuesday\" to mark the last consumption of eggs and dairy before Lent begins.\\n\\nIn the Orthodox Church, Great Lent begins on Clean Monday, rather than Wednesday, so the household's dairy products would be used up in the preceding week, called Cheesefare Week.During Lent, since chickens would not stop producing eggs during this time, a larger than usual store might be available at the end of the fast if the eggs had not been allowed to hatch. The surplus, if any, had to be eaten quickly to prevent spoiling. Then, with the coming of Easter, Pascha the eating of eggs resumes. \\n\\nOne would have been forced to hard boil the eggs that the chickens produced so as not to waste food, and for this reason the Spanish dish hornazo (traditionally eaten on and around Easter) contains hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient.In Hungary, easter eggs are used sliced in potato casseroles around Easter.\\n\\nBeeping Easter eggs are Easter eggs that emit various clicks and noises so that the visually-impaired children can easily hunt for Easter eggs. \\n\\nSome beeping Easter eggs make a single, high-pitched sound, while other types of beeping Easter eggs play a melody.\\n\\nSince 2008, the International Association of Bomb Investigators and Technicians (IABTI) have sponsored a nationwide charity campaign in the U.S., building beeping easter eggs every year for visually impaired children.\\n\\n"}

The mountains included are the Laurentian Mountains, to the north of the ecoregion, and the northernmost ranges of the Appalachian Mountains chain to the south, with peaks over 1000m, including the rugged Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec. The climate is cool and wet and the coast is subject to heavy fog, especially on the Strait of Belle Isle between Labrador and Newfoundland for example. The Central Canadian Shield forests ecoregion lies inland to the west and has more black spruce than the balsam fir that are the dominant tree in this ecoregion. . \\n\\nThe dominant trees of these coastal forests are balsam fir Abies balsamea along with black spruce Picea mariana, white spruce Picea glauca on the shoreline, and paper birch Betula papyrifera and aspen where the forest is regrown following logging or other disturbance. Other plants include moss and coastal heath shrubs. Sheltered areas within the mountains, such as the valley around Lac St. Jean have a different woodland pattern. \\n\\nThis coast is a breeding ground for large colonies of eider and other seabirds. Mammals include moose (Alces alces), American black bear (Ursus americanus), Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), snowshoe hare and grey wolf.\\n\\nThis coast has long been inhabited and the forest much altered especially by logging. However up to 40% remains intact, especially in the north of the region in Quebec, while the Gaspé Peninsula, northern New Brunswick and Newfoundland are more heavily populated and the environment therefore much changed and fragmented.

{"title": "Eastern Rumelia", "body": "Eastern Rumelia or Eastern Roumelia (, Iztochna Rumeliya; , Rumeli-i Şarkî;  , Anatoliki Romylia) was an administratively autonomous province (Oblast in Bulgarian, vilayet in Turkish) in the Ottoman Empire from 1878 to 1908. It was under full Bulgarian control from 1885 on, when it willingly united with the widely autonomous Principality of Bulgaria after a bloodless revolution. Ethnic Bulgarians composed the absolute demographic majority within Eastern Rumelia. Its capital was Plovdiv (Ottoman Filibe, usually known in the West at the time by its Greek name Philippopolis). Today, Eastern Rumelia (the largest part of Northern Thrace) is part of Bulgaria.\\n\\nEastern Rumelia was created as an autonomous province within the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. It encompassed the territory between the Balkan Mountains, the Rhodope Mountains and Strandzha, a region known to all its inhabitantsBulgarians, Ottoman Turks, Roma, Greeks, Armenians and Jewsas Northern Thrace. The artificial  name, Eastern Rumelia, was given to the province on the insistence of the British delegates to the Congress of Berlin: the Ottoman notion of Rumelia refers to all European regions of the empire, i.e. those that were in Antiquity under the Roman Empire. Some twenty Pomak (Bulgarian Muslim) villages in the Rhodope Mountains refused to recognize Eastern Rumelian authority and formed the so-called Republic of Tamrash.\\n\\nThe province is remembered today by philatelists for having issued postage stamp from 1880 on. See the main article, Postage stamps and postal history of Eastern Rumelia.\\n\\nAfter a bloodless revolution on 6 September 1885, the province was annexed by the tributary Principality of Bulgaria. After the Bulgarian victory in the subsequent Serbo-Bulgarian War, the status quo was recognized by the Porte with the Tophane Agreement on 24 March 1886. With the Tophane Act, Sultan Abdul Hamid II appointed the Prince of Bulgaria (without mentioning the name of the incumbent prince Alexander of Bulgaria) as Governor-General of Eastern Rumelia, thus retaining the formal distinction between the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia and preserving the letter of the Berlin Treaty. However, it was clear to the Great Powers that the union between the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia was permanent, and not to be dissolved. The Republic of Tamrash and the region of Kardzhali were reincorporated in the Ottoman Empire. The province was nominally under Ottoman suzerainty until Bulgaria became de jure independent in 1908. 6 September, Unification Day, is a national holiday in Bulgaria.\\n\\nrightAccording to the Treaty of Berlin, Eastern Rumelia was to remain under the political and military jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire with significant administrative autonomy (Article 13). The law frame of Eastern Rumelia was defined with the Organic Statute which was adopted on 14 April 1879 and was in force until the Unification with Bulgaria in 1885. According to the Organic Statute the head of the province was a Christian Governor-General appointed by the Sublime Porte with the approval of the Great Powers. The legislative organ was a Provincial Counsel which consisted of 56 persons, of which 10 were appointed by the Governor-General, 10 were permanent and 36 were directly elected by the people.\\n\\nEastern Rumelia consisted of the departments (департаменти, departamenti; in Ottoman terminology sanjaks, in Bulgarian области oblasti) of Plovdiv (Filibe), Pazardzhik (Tatarpazarcığı), Haskovo (Hasköy), Stara Zagora (Eski Zağra), Sliven (İslimye) and Burgas (Burgaz), in turn divided into cantons (equivalent to Ottoman kazas, Bulgarian околии okolii).\\n\\nrightThe first Governor-General was the Bulgarian prince Alexander Bogoridi (1879–1884) who was acceptable to both Bulgarians and Greeks in the province. The second Governor-General was Gavril Krastevich (1884–1885), a famous Bulgarian historian. Before the first Governor-General, Arkady Stolypin was the Russian Civil Administrator from 9 October 1878 to 18 May 1879.\\n\\nDuring the period of Bulgarian annexation Georgi Stranski was appointed as a Commissioner for South Bugaria (9 September 1885 - 5 April 1886), and when the province was restored to nominal Ottoman sovereignty, but still under Bulgarian control, the Prince of Bulgaria was recognized by the Sublime Porte as the Governor-General.\\n\\nthumbthumbAs with the rest of the Ottoman empire in the 19th century, Eastern Rumelia was ethnically mixed. The earliest information on the ethnic demographics of Eastern Rumelia, before the first census was conducted, comes from ethnographic maps of the Balkans by Western cartographers. All show the region to be inhabited by Bulgarians, Greeks, and Turks, however with varying degrees of predominance. Not all these cartographers, however, were neutral, either in their sources or the interpretation of the material. For example, the maps by the English cartographer Stanford and the French A. Synvet, have been regarded as pro-Greek by later historians. Stanford made his 1877 map from sources provided by the Association for the propagation of Greek letters, a Greek organization, rejecting language as a criterion for nationality, in disregard of the established criteria at the time. Synvet, a professor at the Ottoman lyceum, made his map from sources provided by the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople.\\n\\nThere is little information on the actual population numbers of the different ethnic groups before 1878. According to a British report before the 1877–1878 war, the non-Muslim population (which were mostly Bulgarians) of Eastern Rumelia, was about 60% which proportion grew due to the flight and emigration of Muslims during and after the war. The results of the first Regional Assembly elections of 17 October 1879 show a predominantly Bulgarian character: Of the 36 elected deputies, 31 were Bulgarians (86.1%), 3 were Greeks (8.3%) and two were Turks (5.6%). The ethnic statistics from the censuses of 1880 and 1884 show a Bulgarian majority in the province. In the discredited census of 1880, some 590,000 people (72.3%) self-identified as Bulgarians, 158,000 (19.4%) as Turks, 19,500 (2.4%) as Roma, and 48,000 (5.9%) belonged to other ethnicities, notably Greeks, Armenians and Jews. The repetition of the census in 1884 returned similar data: 69.9% Bulgarians, 20.6% Turks and 2.8% Roma.\\n\\nThe ethnic composition of the population of Eastern Rumelia as of 1884, according to the provincial census, was the following:\\n\\nEastern Rumelia was also inhabited by foreign nationals, most notably Austrians, Czechs, Hungarians, French people and Italians.\\n\\nProperty abandoned by Muslims fleeing the Russian army during the 1877–1878 war was appropriated by the local population. The former owners, mostly large landholders, were threatened with reprisals for actions during the war, so that they would not return, for those who did return a 10% property tax was issued, forcing many to sell off their property in order to pay the tax.\\n\\nThe Greek inhabitants of Eastern Rumelia were concentrated on the coast, where they were strong in numbers, and certain cities in the interior such as Plovdiv, where they formed a substantial minority. The Greek population of the region was largely exchanged with Bulgarians from the Greek provinces of Macedonia and Thrace in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars and World War I. Today, there are about 1400 Greeks in the region. as well as about 4200 Karakachans (Sarakatsani)\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eastwood, Nottinghamshire", "body": "Eastwood is a former coal mining town in the Broxtowe district of Nottinghamshire, England. With a population of over 18,000, it is  northwest of Nottingham, and  northeast of Derby, on the border between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Mentioned in Domesday Book, it expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution. The Midland Railway was formed here, and it is the birthplace of D. H. Lawrence. Eastwood is one of the few places where the distinctive dialect of East Midlands English is extensively spoken, in which the name is .\\n\\n\"Eastwood\" is a hybrid place-name, formed from Old English Est, for \"East\", and Old Norse Þveit (), for \"meadow\", \"cleared meadow\", or \"clearing in a wood.\" This is a common element in English place-names, often found as \"Thwaite\". \"Eastwood\" might mean eastern clearing, possibly originating as a Viking-age clearing in Sherwood Forest.\\n\\nThere is some evidence to suggest that the land around Eastwood was occupied in the Middle and Late Palǣolithic periods. Stronger indications of later settlement include fragments of characteristic Bronze Age pottery, weapons, and dug-out canoes, which are now preserved at Nottingham Castle, and at the University of Nottingham. \\n\\nThe location of the settlement is due primarily to the availability of rich agricultural land, the proximity of the River Erewash and—most importantly—the extensive and easily mined coal deposits. It is mentioned in Domesday Book as Estewic, part of the fee of William Peverel:\\n\\nDuring the Anarchy, the 12th century civil war between Stephen of Blois and supporters of Matilde, the mother of the eventual king, Henry II, Peveral's son, William Peverel the Younger, forfeited these to the Crown in 1155. The estate, called the Peverel Honour, was eventually divided, and much of the land around Eastwood was granted to the Greys of Codnor Castle.\\n\\nTenant farming prevailed throughout the Middle Ages, whilst common pasture was mainly used for grazing.thumbWhen King James VI of Scotland became King James I of England in 1603, Eastwood had a population of about 170, and it remained a small village until the 18th century when, in 1779, the Trent Navigation Company opened the Erewash Canal. This was one of the first man made waterways in England, with locks at Beeston linking Eastwood to the River Trent and Nottingham, and its arrival led to a rapid expansion of the local coal mining industry. Other industries soon followed, including framework knitting, corn mill, pottery, brewing, rope making and brick making.\\n\\nThe town expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, and in the 19th century it experienced the greatest increase in population density of any parish in Nottinghamshire. By 1880 the population had increased to 4,500.Factories were built to accommodate the new industries, land becoming available for them as the rural population moved to urban areas. This industrialisation of the countryside was only restricted from the early 19th century, when, somewhat belatedly, the effect of the Enclosure began to be felt in Nottinghamshire. In a local manifestation of this period of upheaval, marchers of the Pentrich Revolution of 1817 passed through the town, and were met by soldiers at nearby Giltbrook: the residents of Eastwood boarded up their houses and hid in the woods.\\n\\nthumbIn 1832, a historic meeting took place at the Sun Inn (built 1750), which resulted in the creation of the Midland Counties Railway, and the construction of a line from Pinxton to Leicester. Industrialisation continued with the opening in 1868 of Moorgreen Colliery, and in 1875 the demand for coal resulted in a railway station in Eastwood, with services to Nottingham on the Great Northern Railway.\\n\\nD.H. Lawrence was born there in 1885. Although the local area is mentioned in many of his novels, it is especially featured in The White Peacock, against a backdrop of industrialisation. There were ten coal mines, or \"pits\", within easy walking distance of Lawrence's home, and the overwhelming majority of the local male population were colliers. Although the coal boom ended during Lawrence's childhood, Eastwood continued to expand, Nottingham Road and its feeder streets became established as a shopping area, and in 1908 the local Urban District Council opened its offices. However, few jobs remained outside what remained of the coal industry. Most women were housewives, and boys were desperate to reach the age of fourteen, when they could start working in the mines. In the early 20th century, trams provided a new means of transport between Nottingham, Ripley and Heanor. Lawrence lived next to the line, and described it as the most dangerous tram service in England.\\n\\nEastwood coal, metal castings, rope, wire and agricultural products made valuable contributions to Britain's war effort during the two world war. In the Second World War, Eastwood supplied soldiers to the Sherwood Foresters Regiment. A memorial on Nottingham Road commemorates Eastwood residents who gave their lives in both world wars.\\n\\nIn 1946, the coal industry was nationalised, and the new National Coal Board acquired Eastwood Hall as their Area Office. This later became their National Office, and was the location for several crisis meetings during the national Miners' Strike of the 1980s. At the height of its production in 1963, Moorgreen Colliery alone produced one million tons of coal, but the last coal mine in the area closed in 1985.\\n\\nIn recent years, tourism has become increasingly important. Lawrence's birthplace is now a museum, and a painted line on the pavement, called the \"Blue Line Trail,\" guides visitors around eleven sites of local interest including three of Lawrence's homes. The trail was the first of its kind in England, the concept being based on the Freedom Trail in Boston, USA.\\n\\nthumbThe Urban District Council for Eastwood became part of Broxtowe District Council in 1974. In 1977 the Council was granted \"borough\" status, becoming the Borough of Broxtowe. The current mayor is Brian Wombwell.\\n\\nEastwood now consists of 3 wards within the borough:\\n\\nAll of these lie within the Borough of Broxtowe, for local government. For national elections, however, the first two wards are in the Ashfield constituency – not the Broxtowe constituency.\\n\\nTwo-tier local authority services in Broxtowe are provided by the Borough Council and Nottinghamshire County Council.\\n\\nBroxtowe Borough Council currently has 44 councillors, representing 21 wards, each returning one, two, or three councillors, according to the population size of the ward. During the most recent local elections, held in 2007, councillors were elected as follows:\\n\\nThe wards of Eastwood South, Eastwood, and Greasley (Beauvale) are in the Ashfield constituency. The current MP is Gloria De Piero, who was elected in 2010 replacing Geoff Hoon who had been MP for Ashfield since 1992.\\n\\nThe ward of Greasley (Giltbrook and Newthorpe) is in the Broxtowe constituency. The current MP is Anna Soubry, who was elected in 2010 beating the incumbent Nick Palmer by 389 votes.\\n\\nParish councils include Eastwood Town Council (North), Eastwood Town Council (South), Greasley (Beauvale), Greasley (Newthorpe), and Greasley (Watnall).\\n\\nThe Borough of Broxtowe is in the European Parliament East Midlands constituency. MEPs are selected by proportional representation and so all East Midlands MEPs share responsibility for Broxtowe's residents.\\n\\nSurrounded by gently rolling countryside, Eastwood is 8 miles to the Northwest of the City of Nottingham in Nottinghamshire and close to the county boundary with Derbyshire.\\n\\nThe area contains coal measure, with shale, mudstone, and sandstone, overlain by yellow clay. Alluvial deposits from the River Erewash run roughly north-south.\\n\\nThe town is centred on Nottingham Road, which runs along a north west-south east ridge. This road contains many shops, including a large Co-op store, and, uphill to the east, it leads to the A610 to Nottingham, the M1 motorway, and Giltbrook Retail Park, which is home to a large Ikea store, and various projected developments (see Future plans). At the western end of Eastwood is a gyratory system, consisting of an ancient crossroads converted into a traffic island, around the Sun Inn public house. A large Morrisons supermarket is here, and roads lead from the gyratory system north to Brinsley, west to Heanor, and south through Church Street, the location of several listed buildings, into New Eastwood.\\n\\nThe town is still surrounded by farmed land, woods and fields, and just half a mile (1 km) to the west, the River Erewash forms the boundary between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Alongside the river, the Erewash Canal leads to the River Trent.\\n\\nA large hill, visible when looking north from the town, is known locally as “dot hill”, “dirt hill”, or “bum hill.” This land has been reclaimed from a former slag heap.\\n\\nAs of the 2001 UK census, the town of Eastwood had a total population of 18,732. Population change can be tracked accurately from the 1911 census until the 1971 census, as Eastwood Urban District was a Local Government District from 1896 until 1974.\\n\\nleft\\n\\nIn the 1951 census, approximately 11.5% of the total population listed their occupation as Mining & Quarrying.By the 2001 survey, this had fallen to 0.15%.\\n\\nIn the 2001 census, over 98% of the population selected the ethnicity White: British. The national average for England was 87%.\\n\\nuprightthumb\\n\\nThe Buildings is a housing estate, consisting of some 300 terraced miners' cottages, built in the 1860s. They were saved from demolition by a council scheme, which won an EEC habitat award in 1977. It was also used to illustrate the European Community's Urban Renaissance competition in 1980.\\n\\nColliers' Wood is a 14 hectare community woodland, part of the Greenwood Community Forest, created in 1996/97 to reclaim some of the woodland and fields destroyed by the mining developments. Over 17,500 trees and hedgerows were planted, and two ponds created. The footpath is made from reclaimed shale. Habitats cater to a wide variety of birds, including mute swans, goldfinches, lesser redpoll, skylark, and willow warbler.\\n\\nA war memorial was unveiled in 1921, inscribed \"to the men of Eastwood, who fell in the Great War 1914-1918.\" Later, World War II dedications were added, and it was moved to its present location at Plumptre Way. It is in the shape of an obelisk, made of Italian marble with a base of Whatstandwell stone.The Library, opened in 1975, includes an extensive collection of books by and about D H Lawrence. Also on view is Lawrence's desk, and the headstone from his grave in Vence, France.\\n\\nGreasley Castle (c.1341) was founded by Nicholas de Cantilupe. The remains are now covered by Greasley Castle Farmhouse (c. 1800), which incorporates fragments of medieval masonry.\\n\\nThe Blue Line Trail - painted along the pavement - guides visitors around the areas connected with the author D.H.

{"title": "Eaton Faning", "body": "rightJoseph Eaton Faning (20 May 1850 – 28 October 1927), known as Eaton Faning, was an English composer and teacher. The son of a music teacher, he became the organist of a church at the age of twelve. He attended the Royal Academy of Music, where his teachers included Arthur Sullivan. He was an outstanding student, winning many awards. He joined the staff of the Academy in 1874 and later taught at the Guildhall School of Music, the Royal College of Music and Harrow School.\\n\\nAs a composer, Faning's works ranged from operetta, including a one-act Savoy Opera, to church music, including a Mass and a Magnificat. He also composed orchestral music including a symphony, and was best-known for his songs, of which the most popular was the part-song The Vikings. \\n\\nleftFaning was born in Helston, Cornwall, where his father, Roger Faning, was a music teacher. Faning received his first instruction in music (piano and violin) from his parents. At the age of five he made his first public appearance at a local function, when he played a violin solo on a tiny fiddle. When he was nine years old, his father died, and the family moved to Ipswich, Suffolk. Faning sang alto in the choir of a local church and studied the organ and the violin with local teachers. At the age of twelve, he became organist of All Saints' Church Holbrook, a village seven miles from Ipswich, where he had to walk when the carrier's cart was not available. He subsequently studied under Lindley Nunn, organist of St. Mary-le-Tower, Ipswich, who appointed Faning his deputy. This post was of the greatest practical value to the young musician. He played at the daily evening service for five years, and was deputy trainer of the choir, which consisted of sixty voices. \\n\\nIn April 1870, just before his twentieth birthday, Faning entered the Royal Academy of Music as a student. He studied composition under Sterndale Bennett (then Principal) and Arthur Sullivan, and, with other professors, singing, piano, cello and organ. He later recalled how much he learnt from Bennett about form, and from Sullivan about orchestration. His first appearance at an Academy concert was as a pianist, when he played Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata in October 1870. In 1871 he was awarded the Academy's bronze medal, and the silver medal the following year. As a student, he sang in the chorus at the Royal Albert Hall when Richard Wagner conducted, and he visited Bayreuth and Dresden. He later prepared the Royal Choral Society in Wagner's Parsifal for two concert performances at the Royal Albert Hall in 1884. \\n\\nFaning began composing while a student, producing an overture and two string quartets in 1871, and a symphony in 1872. In 1873 he was elected an extra Mendelssohn Scholar, and in 1876 he obtained the Lucas silver medal for composition for his setting of the Magnificat. Sir John Stainer heard the work and selected it for performance at the Festival of the Sons of the Clergy in 1878, and the publishers Novello &amp; Co printed an edition of the score. During his Academy years, he was organist successively of St. Thomas's Church, Paddington and St. John's Church, Lewisham. He conducted two amateur musical societies and \"Mr. Eaton Faning's Select Choir,\" a professional group that sang at Boosey's London Ballad Concerts.\\n\\nrightFaning was appointed to the staff of the Academy in 1874 as a sub-professor of harmony, an assistant professor of the piano in 1877, and full professor a year later. In 1877 he was elected an Associate, and in 1881 a Fellow of the Academy, its highest honour for a former student. On 18 July 1877, the Academy hosted the performance of Faning's comic operetta in one act, The Two Majors. The libretto, by Edward Rose, was adapted from one of W. S. Gilbert's \"Bab Ballads\". Sullivan \"took a warm and practical interest\" in the composition of Faning's score. The piece was described by The Musical Times as \"highly amusing and capital … with its clever parodies of some of the absurdities of Italian opera … capitally rendered, under the composer's direction\". Another critic praised the music and the staging, though adding that as it was a student performance, \"there was a necessary elongation of those garments over which the Lord Chamberlain traditionally keeps such jealous watch and ward.\" The success of Faning's piece led the faculty of the Academy to establish an operatic class. \\n\\nIn October 1881 Faning's second comic operetta, Mock Turtles was produced at the Savoy Theatre as a curtain-raiser to Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience. It ran in tandem with Patience and then Iolanthe until March 1883. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company also toured the piece in the British provinces. In 1882 Faning wrote his third short operetta The Head of the Poll, presented by the German Reeds, with a libretto by Arthur Law. The reviews were good, though they concentrated on the libretto, praising the music in passing as \"very spirited\", \"pretty\" and \"merry and melodious\". In the same year Faning's overture The Holiday was played at the promenade concerts, Covent Garden. \\n\\nIn August 1882 Faning married Caroline Pare Galpin. They had one son and three daughters. Faning composed a comic \"Savage Dance\" (intermezzo) for orchestra, and he conducted it, dressed \"in the garb of a savage\", for The Savage Club entertainment at the Royal Albert Hall in July 1883. This was a fund-raising concert for the Royal College of Music in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales. His other compositions ranged from Buttercups and Daisies, a pastoral cantata for children's voices (1892), a Mass in B minor, works for solo piano, and a variety of songs and choral works. His two most popular songs were \"I've something sweet to tell you,\" and a part song (originally with piano accompaniment, later orchestrated), \"The Vikings\". \\n\\nIn addition to his professorship at the Royal Academy of Music, Faning was a professor of the piano at the Guildhall School of Music from 1882; a professor of the piano and harmony, and conductor of the choral class at the National Training School of Music. He remained in those posts when the School became the Royal College of Music in 1883, continuing there until 1887. In 1885, Faning accepted the post of director of music of Harrow School, where music was given great importance. He had a staff of six assistant music masters, and remained at Harrow until 1901.\\n\\nFaning retired to Brighton, where he died at the age of 77.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ebbe Sand", "body": "Ebbe Sand (born July 19, 1972) is a Danish former professional footballer who most notably played as a striker for FC Schalke 04 in Germany. He was the German Bundesliga top scorer in 2001, and he won the German Cup in 2001 and 2002 with Schalke. On the international stage, he represented the Denmark national football team at the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cup, as well as the 2000 and 2004 European Championship and he has scored the fastest World Cup goal by a substitute, when he scored after 16 seconds at the 1998 World Cup.In all, he was selected 66 times for the Danish national team and scored 22 goals, from his debut in 1998 until he decided to focus on playing for Schalke in 2004. When his contract with Schalke ran out in the Summer 2006, he moved back to Denmark to become head talent scout at Silkeborg IF. At his retirement in 2006, he was granted a testimonial match between the Danish national team and his former Danish club Brøndby IF.\\n\\nBorn in Hadsund in Denmark, he started playing for hometown club Hadsund BK alongside his twin brother Peter Sand. Moving to Copenhagen in order to study building engineering, he and his brother Peter decided to try their luck at Brøndby IF. After three years of playing only a few games as attacking midfielder, Ebbe Sand got a chance to play regularly in 1995 and he soon made a name for himself. His brother would never play for Brøndby, but played professionally for a number of other clubs.\\n\\nHe scored 12 goals in 30 games in breakthrough season and helped Brøndby win the Danish Superliga title. Brøndby matched that feat in both 1997 and 1998, with 1998 being an even better year for both Sand and Brøndby. Sand won the Danish Golden Boot as he scored 28 goals in 33 games and helped Brøndby win the Danish Cup, completing the Double. Sand was first capped for the Denmark national football team on April 22, 1998 against Norway, and following his great 1998 season, he was selected to play for Denmark in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. \\n\\nHe took part in all five Denmark matches at the World Cup, and scored his first goal for Denmark in the game against Nigeria, his own most treasured goal for the national team. Entering as a substitute, he ran into the blind spot of the defense, had the ball lobbed to him over the heads of the defenders by Michael Laudrup, before he headed the ball to his right, past the Nigerian Taribo West, and slotted the ball home in the lower left corner. It only took 16 seconds from his substitution to his goal, a World Cup record that still stands. Following his break through on the international stage, he was named Danish ''Player of the Year''. In 1998, Sand was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He had the cancer removed and was back in action just a few weeks after the operation.\\n\\nthumbFollowing the 1998 World Cup, Sand played one more season for Brøndby, in which he scored another 19 goals. He was then transferred to German club Schalke for 10 million DEM in 1999, at that time the most expensive sale by a Danish club. Sand's first season in Germany was successful, as he scored 14 goals, although Schalke only finished 13th in the Bundesliga that year. After scoring four goals in the qualification matches, he played twice for Denmark at the 2000 European Championship (Euro 2000) tournament, before he was benched in the last game of a lack-lustre Danish performance. \\n\\nThe 2000–01 season was much more successful for Sand. Schalke finished second in the Bundesliga, after a goal from Bayern Munich 4 minutes into the added time, ruining Schalkes championship dreams. Despite this they qualified for the UEFA Champions League. They also won the German Cup. Sand scored 22 goals and tied with Sergej Barbarez for the title of lead topscorer in Germany, and he once again won the Danish Player of the Year award in 2001. Schalke won the German Cup again in 2002 and finished fifth in the league, with Sand tallying 11 goals. For the national team, he scored an impressive nine goals in ten qualification games for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but he failed to impress at the final tournament, and was benched the last group match, although he did play three times. \\n\\nHis following years at Schalke would be less successful, as he only scored 6 and 8 goals in the next two seasons, respectively. For Denmark's run in the Euro 2004, Sand missed Denmark's final game due to injury, and he decided to retire from international football. He cited a desire to focus his last active years on playing for Schalke, though he would be ready to re-enter the Denmark team if it qualified for 2006 FIFA World Cup tournament if his form would allow it, though that never became relevant for either party. Initially in his last year of contract, he prolonged his stay at Schalke by a year, despite only scoring 8 goals in 2005. In July 2005, he announced the coming season as his last for Schalke and following seven years in Germany he would move to Denmark in order to work at Danish Superliga club Silkeborg IF. He thereby turned down an offer from Schalke manager Rudi Assauer to become his managerial protege at Schalke. For his last season at Schalke he was chosen as team captain, even though stiff competition by fellow Dane Søren Larsen and German striker Kevin Kurányi relegated Sand's role to substitute player. He ended his Schalke career at the Bundesliga game with VfB Stuttgart on May 13, 2006, scoring a goal in the 3–2 Schalke victory before being substituted to a standing ovation by the spectators.\\n\\nTotal number of goals for Brøndby IF (1992–1999):\\n\\n'''Total number of goals for FC Schalke 04 (1999–2006):\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ecclesiastical full moon", "body": "An ecclesiastical full moon is the fourteenth day of a lunar month (an ecclesiastical moon) in an ecclesiastical lunar calendar. The ecclesiastical lunar calendar spans the year with lunar months of 30 and 29 days which are intended to approximate the observed phases of the moon. Since a true synodic month has a length that can vary from about 29.27 to 29.83 days, the moment of astronomical opposition tends to be roughly 14.75 days after the previous conjunction of the sun and moon. The ecclesiastical full moons of the Gregorian lunar calendar tend to agree with the dates of astronomical opposition, referred to a day beginning at midnight at 0 degrees longitude, to within a day or so. However, the astronomical opposition happens at a single moment for the entire earth: The hour and day at which the opposition is measured as having taken place will vary with longitude. In the ecclesiastical calendar, the 14th day of the lunar month, reckoned in local time, is considered the day of the full moon at each longitude. \\n\\nSchematic lunar calendars can and do get out of step with the moon. A useful way of checking their performance is to compare the variation of the astronomical new moon (as tabulated in almanacs and many newspapers) with a standard time of 6 A.M. on the last day of a 30 - day month and 6 P.M.

The same practice is followed in some editions of the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England.\\n\\n"}

According to the 2001 Census, the population of the entire civil parish was 184.The village is situated on the estate of the Duke of Westminster who maintains his ancestral home at nearby Eaton Hall.\\n\\nIt is believed that the name of the village derives from the Latin for 'Meeting Place'\\n\\nFormerly a township in Broxton Hundred, it includes the hamlet of Belgrave and Morris Oak. The population was 199 in 1801, 289 in 1851, 320 in 1901 and 272 in 1951.\\n\\nThe church at Eccleston is called St. Mary's Church. It was built at the expense of the Duke of Westminster and cost £40,000 in 1899. It was built on the site of an earlier church that was constructed in 1809. Part of the churchyard is unusual in that it is circular in shape, which indicates pagan origins. In 1929 an excavation revealed 20 bodies which are believed to date from 390 AD. They are the earliest known Christian burials in Cheshire.\\n\\nTwo War Memorials exist within the Church, one of Bronze recording those that fell during World War I and a wooden memorial recording those that fell during World War II\\n\\nThe Churchyard is also the resting place of Alfred Ernest Ind VC, who died on 29 November 1916.

In Eckington was also the Eckington Secondary Modern School on School Street; when the grammar school became Derbyshire's first comprehensive school - the Westfield School - in 1957, this became Eckington Junior School.\\n\\nThe school catchment area includes surrounding areas such as Killamarsh, Renishaw, Beighton, Ridgeway and sometimes Mosborough. Despite the school being closer to several Sheffield residential areas (including Beighton and Mosborough) than other Derbyshire ones, the admissions policy is set in such a way to favour pupils coming from the Derbyshire feeder schools in areas such as Killamarsh and Renishaw. This is because most students from the Mosbrough and Beighton area attend Westfield School.\\n\\nThe school's uniform has recently been changed to a more formal style consisting of black shoes, black tailored trousers, a white shirt and an Eckington school blazer.\\n\\nEckington Comprehensive is designated a specialist engineering college.

{"title": "Economy of New York City", "body": "thumb\\n\\nThe economy of New York City is the biggest regional economy in the United States and the second largest city economy in the world after Tokyo. Anchored by Wall Street, in Lower Manhattan, New York City is the financial capital of the world alongside London and is home to the New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest stock exchange by market capitalization of its listed companies. New York is distinctive for its high concentrations of advanced service sector firms in fields such as law, accountancy, banking and management consultancy.\\n\\nThe financial, insurance, health care, and real estate industries form the basis of New York's economy. The city is also the most important center for mass media, journalism and publishing in the United States, and is the preeminent arts center in the country. Creative industries such as new media, advertising, fashion, design and architecture account for a growing share of employment, with New York City possessing a strong competitive advantage in these industries. Manufacturing, although declining, remains consequential.\\n\\nThe New York Stock Exchange is by far the largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization of listed companies. The NASDAQ electronic exchange has the most companies listed and is third largest in the world by market capitalization of listed companies.\\n\\nThe New York metropolitan area had an estimated gross metropolitan product of $1.13 trillion in 2005, the largest regional economy in the United States. The city's economy accounts for the majority of the economic activity in the states of New York and New Jersey.\\n\\nReal estate is a significant factor in the city of New York's economy. In 2006 the total value of Manhattan property was $802.4 billion  The Time Warner Center is the property with the highest-listed market value in the city, at $1.1 billion in 2006. The UK consulting firm Mercer, in a 2009 assessment \"conducted to help governments and major companies place employees on international assignments\", ranked New York City 49th worldwide in quality of living; the survey factored in political stability, personal freedom, sanitation, crime, housing, the natural environment, recreation, banking facilities, availability of consumer goods, education, and public services including transportation. thumbSome of the most expensive office space in the United States is located in New York City. 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007 for $510 million, about $1,589 per square foot ($17,104/m²), breaking the barely month-old record for an American office building of $1,476 per square foot ($15,887/m²) set in the June 2007 sale of 660 Madison Avenue. Manhattan had 353.7 million square feet (32,860,000 m²) of office space in 2001.\\n\\nMidtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the world. New York City has long been the leading business center in the United States, but with the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970s a new trend began to develop resulting in corporate headquarters and subsidiaries gradually moving to the suburbs and other regions.\\n\\nIn 2005 there were 602 stand-alone headquarter operations for major companies in the city. Many international corporations are headquartered in the city, including more Fortune 500 companies than any other city. It is also the home of JetBlue Airways, headquartered in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens.\\n\\nOut of the 500 U.S. corporations with the largest revenues in 2009, as listed by Fortune magazine in May 2010, 42 had headquarters in New York City and another 14 elsewhere in New York state (total 56). In the 1997 Fortune 500, 46 corporations had New York City headquarters, out of 61 corporations headquartered in New York state. \\n\\nIn the May 2008 Fortune 500 list, reflecting the year before the global financial crisis of 2007-2010, five of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies in New York City were classified as securities firms (reflecting the importance of Wall Street), but two years later, none were. Two of the securities firms (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) had converted themselves into commercial banks, while different banks had absorbed either the organization or the post-liquidation assets of the other three firms (Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers). \\n\\nthumbthumb\\n\\nThe New York Stock Exchange, located on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ are the world's first and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured by average daily trading volume and overall market capitalization. Financial services account for more than 35 percent of the city's employment income.\\n\\nNew York City has been a leading center of finance in the world economy since the end of World War I. As of August, 2008 the city's financial services industry employs 344,700 workers. Manhattan is home to six major stock, commodities and futures exchanges: American Stock Exchange, International Securities Exchange, NASDAQ, New York Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange, and New York Stock Exchange. This contributes to New York City being a major financial service exporter, both within the United States and globally. \\n\\nThe 280,000 workers in the finance industry collect more than half of all the wages paid in Manhattan, although they hold fewer than one of every six jobs in the borough. The pay gap between them and the 1.5 million other workers in Manhattan continues to widen, causing some economists to worry about the city’s growing dependence on their extraordinary incomes. Those high salaries contribute to job growth, but most of this job growth occurs in lower-paying service jobs in restaurants, retail and home health care and not many jobs in highly paid areas.\\n\\nSince the founding of the Federal Reserve banking system, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Manhattan's financial district has been where monetary policy in the United States is implemented, although policy is decided in Washington by the Federal Reserve Bank's Board of Governors. The New York Fed is the largest, in terms of assets, and the most important of the twelve regional banks. It is responsible for the second district, which covers New York State and the New York City region, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The New York Fed is responsible for conducting open market operations, the buying and selling of outstanding US Treasury securities. In 2003, Fedwire, the Federal Reserve's system for transferring balances between it and other banks, transferred $1.8 trillion a day in funds, of which about $1.1 trillion originated in the Second District. It transferred an additional $1.3 trillion a day in securities, of which $1.2 trillion originated in the Second District. The New York Federal Reserve is the only regional bank with a permanent vote on the Federal Open Market Committee and its president is traditionally selected as the Committee's vice chairman. The bank also has the largest gold repository in the world, larger even than Fort Knox. Its vault is 80 feet (25 m) beneath the street and holds $160 billion worth of gold bullion.\\n\\nworkforce (2004 American Community Survey).\\n\\nThese are small businesses, with an average size of 21 employees (NYS DOL, 2nd Qtr 2005). Examples of goods manufactured in the city include broadway costumes, custom-made cabinets, croissant for hotels, and wooden crates for shipping fine art. These items are labor-intensive and require collaboration between the end-user and the manufacturer. In recent years, as real estate and globalization pressures have increased, the remaining manufacturers have become more design-oriented and single customer-focused. To boot, production methods have become cleaner and more technology-driven.\\n\\nDespite the adaptability of New York manufacturers, there remain looming challenges to the sector’s survival. A 2003 city-sponsored survey of the industrial sector identified three major local challenges to retaining businesses: 1) high cost of real estate; 2) high costs of doing business; and, 3) uncertainty about land use policy.\\n\\nA  biodiesel plant run by Tri-State Biodiesel, LLC will begin construction in the Bronx in 2010. The facility will process used cooking oil collected by TSB from over 2000 New York restaurants with methanol and a catalyst to create biodiesel fuel. More than one million gallons of waste oil could be collected in Brooklyn every year according to a 2004 Cornell study. The fuel produces 78 percent less carbon-dioxide emissions than standard diesel.\\n\\nHigh-tech industries like software development, gaming design, and Internet services are also growing; New York is the leading international internet gateway in the United States, with 430 Gbit/s of international internet capacity terminates, because of its position at the terminus of the transatlantic fiber optic trunkline. By comparison, the number two U.S. hub, Washington/Baltimore, has 158 Gbit/s of internet terminates. More than two-thirds of New Yorkers have Internet in their homes.\\n\\nAccording to New York’s Economic Development Corporation, telecom carriers, cable companies, Internet service providers and publishers were a $23 billion industry in 2003. This represents over three percent of the city’s economy. The sector employs 43,000 city residents. \\n\\nIn 2006 Google moved into  of office space in the second-largest building in New York City, at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. The location is one of the most important \"telecom hotels\" in the world, a giant networking facility adjacent to the Hudson Street/Ninth Avenue fiber highway, one of the most critical Internet arteries in the world. Employing more than 500 people, it is Google's largest engineering complex outside of company headquarters. Google products engineered in the New York offices include Maps, Spreadsheets, Checkout, Blog search, and Mobile search. Google's large investment in its New York operations has led to speculation about new multimedia initiatives by the company.\\n\\nthumbCity of New York is unique among American cities for its large number of foreign corporations. One out of every ten private sector jobs in the city is with a foreign company. Often this makes the perspective of New York’s business community internationalist and at odds with Washington’s foreign policy, trade policy, and visa policy.\\n\\nSince 2000, China has been New York's leading growth market for exports. The New York Metropolitan Region is home to more than half of the 32 largest Chinese companies with offices in the United States. These companies represent a broad array of industries including shipping, steel, energy and manufacturing firms, and services. Many have chosen to open headquarters in New York in anticipation of eventual listing on the respective New York stock exchanges and entering U.S. capital markets. New York City currently boasts seven Chinese daily newspapers, two Chinese language television stations, and the largest Chinese neighborhood in the United States. New York area airports provide 12 daily flights to Hong Kong and five to Beijing, the most flights out of the eastern half of the United States.\\n\\nIn one measure of how international New York City's economy is, data compiled by the agents Knight Frank show foreign owners make up 34% of sales in the city's prime residential market. New York ranks ahead of Paris, where such sales account for 27%, Hong Kong (13%), and Sydney (9%). London, however, is the most cosmopolitan world city in terms of property ownership; more than 51% of homes there worth more than £2m ($3.8m, EU3m) sold in 2005 have gone to overseas buyers from Russia, the Middle East and elsewhere.\\n\\nInternational shipping has always been a major part of the city's economy because of New York's natural harbor, but with the advent of containerization most cargo shipping has moved from the Brooklyn waterfront across the harbor to the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey. Some cargo shipping remains; for example, Brooklyn still handles the majority of cocoa bean imports to the United States.\\n\\nResearch and Medical services drive New York's major healthcare industry. New York City has the most post-graduate life sciences degrees awarded annually in the United States, 40,000 licensed physicians, and 127 Nobel laureates with roots in local institutions. New York receives the second-highest amount of annual funding from the National Institutes of Health among all U.S. cities.\\n\\nThe major publicly-traded biopharma companies include Bristol Myers Squibb, Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, ImClone Systems, OSI Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, Regeneron, CuraGen, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals . Pfizer shifted 1,000 jobs to New York City from New Jersey, Missouri, Michigan and California in 2003. According to the Partnership for New York City, New York institutions create more biotechnology-related patentsthan any other metropolitan area in the United States.\\n\\nHealth care industry employs approximately 375,000 people in New York City, making it the city's largest employer. In New York, 40,000 physicians work at more than 70 hospitals ; the city's 20 public hospitals served 1.5 million people in 1998 alone.\\n\\nNew York is by far the most important center for American mass media, journalism and publishing. The city is the number-one media market in the United States with 7% of the country’s television-viewing households. Three of the Big Four music recording companies have their headquarters in the city. One-third of all independent films are produced in the Big Apple. More than 200 newspapers and 350 consumer magazines have an office in the city. The book publishing industry alone employs 25,000 people. For these reasons, New York is often called \"the media capital of the world.\" It is also home to PBS stations WLIW and WNET. WNET's headquarters are in Manhattan, and WLIW's headquarters are in Plainview, New York, which is located on Long Island.\\n\\nThe city's television and film industry is the second largest in the country after Hollywood.\\n\\nFilm is a growing sector; according to the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting New York City attracted over 250 independent and studio films in 2005, an increase from 202 in 2004 and 180 in 2003. More than a third of professional actors in the United States are based in New York. The city's movie industry employs 100,000 New Yorkers, according to the Office, and about $5 billion is brought by the industry to the city's economy every yearThe Kaufman-Astoria film studio in Queens, built during the silent film era, was used by the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. It has also been the set for The Cosby Show and Sesame Street. The recently constructed Steiner Studios is a 15 acre (61,000 m²) modern movie studio complex in a former shipyard where The Producers and The Inside Man, a Spike Lee movie, were filmed.\\n\\nSilvercup Studios revealed plans in February 2006 for a new $1 billion complex with eight soundstages, production and studio support space, offices for media and entertainment companies, stores, 1,000 apartments in high-rise towers, a catering hall and a cultural institution.

{"title": "Ecuadorian hermit crab", "body": "The Ecuadorian hermit crab (Coenobita compressus) also known as the Pacific hermit crab is a species of land hermit crab. It is one of the two land hermit crabs commonly sold in North America, including the United States, as a pet, the other being the Caribbean hermit crab (Coenobita clypeatus).\\n\\nleftCoenobita compressus is a member of the phylum Arthropoda and the class Malacostraca. They can be up to 12mm in length and are thought to be one the smallest species of land hermit crabs. They have four walking legs, a small pincer, a large pincer, and antennae. Many people who keep these hermit crabs as pets notice that Ecuador can be relatively fast walkers, even faster than Caribbean hermit crabs, and that they are quite active. The eyes of Ecuadorians are more oval-shaped when compared to the round eyes of Caribbean hermit crabs and are thicker. Their big claw has 4 or 5 small ridges on the upper part. The tips of the second pair of walking legs are darker than the rest of the leg. The abdomen of the Ecuadorian hermit crab is short and fat. \\n\\nEcuadorian hermit crabs vary greatly in color, some are bright (yellow, dark grey, or orange), but more often they are a tan color. Sometimes they may have a blue or green tint to their bodies or the insides of their legs. They also have comma-shaped eyes, unlike the \"purple pincher\" (Coenobita clypeatus), which has dot shaped eyes. \\n\\nWhen choosing a shell, they tend to give preference to shells with a wide and round aperture. As with all hermit crabs, painted shells are harmful to them, as they often eat the paint chips and can be poisoned with chemicals used in the paint. This significantly shortens their life span.\\n\\nNative to Ecuador and Chile, these hermit crabs live on the Pacific seashore around tidal pool and high-tide zone. Their bodies have adapted to this seashore existence and in captivity, they require access to seawater as they must metabolize the salt in it and bathe in it to maintain gill moisture. Failure to provide access to seawater (real or artificial) will result in death. \\n\\nLike most hermit crabs they are scavenger and will consume seaweed, dead fish and other detritus that washes up on the shore.\\n\\nCoenobita compressus prefers the odors of foods that they have not recently eaten. The hermit crabs that were exposed to one food for at least 9 hours preferred foods having other odors for the next 6 hours. It is this short-term avoidance of food (like human beings who get bored with the same meals over and over again) that compels the crabs to seek out a wider range of food. This might be advantageous to the hermit crab, possibly through the consumption of a more nutritionally-balanced diet.\\n\\nHermit crabs overall were once seen as a \"throwaway pet\" that would live only a few months, but species such as Coenobita clypeatus has a 23 year lifespan if properly treated  and some have lived longer than 32 years. Similarly Ecuadorian hermit crabs have been known to live to over 30 years. In general, and despite their moniker, hermit crabs are social animals that do best in groups . They also require a temperature and humidity-controlled environment (ideally 70%-78%), and adequate substrate to allow them to bury themselves while molting.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eddie Paskey", "body": "Edward J. Paskey, better known as Eddie, (born Aug. 20, 1939) is a U.S. actor primarily known for his role as \"Lieutenant Leslie\", a redshirt, on Star Trek. He appeared in 57 episodes.\\n\\nPaskey was born in a small farming town in Delaware but was raised in California. He moved with his family to Santa Monica in 1952. In his youth he was immersed in automobiles by working at his father's garage, and developed an interest in hot rods from a young age. His first car was a 1941 Ford coupe but was later replaced by a 1955 Ford Thunderbird that he purchased while earning $1.25 per hour.\\n\\nPaskey's first television role was in the drama Ben Casey (1966)after meeting series producer Irving Elman while working at a service station in Pacific Palisades. In it he was credited as \"Policeman.\" For the next five or six years he continued to act while working at the service station on weekends. He appeared on Mission: Impossible in the 1966 episode \"The Ransom,\" The Lucy Show, Twelve O'Clock High, The Wild Wild West and Please Don't Eat the Daisies. He also appeared in uncredited rolls in the films What Did You Do in the War, Daddy? and Mister Buddwing.\\n\\nPaskey first appeared on Star Trek as a \"crewman\" on the second pilot episode \"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\" and was first identified by name in \"Mudd's Women\" in an early scene where Doctor McCoy refers to him as \"Connors.\" In subsequent episodes, he was cast regularly as a crewman, but also appeared as a security officer, a helmsman, an engineer station officer, even an alien, all to create a sense of continuity on Star Trek during the series' run. Paskey had scripted lines in four episodes and was credited in two. His character, Mr. Leslie, appeared in more episodes than principal characters Sulu or Chekov. William Shatner gave the character the name \"Leslie\", after Shatner's eldest daughter. To pay homage to the character of Leslie, a fan based website created an 8\" action figure in Paskey's likeness.\\n\\nPaskey credits the longevity of his character to his sense of caution. Since he was on the set most of the time and knew the script well, he made sure that he was always elsewhere when an episode called for someone to die.When his character does die in the episode \"Obsession,\" Paskey explains his mysterious return in the next episode by describing a lost scene, where Dr. McCoy administered a miracle potion that saves Leslie's life, that ended up on the cutting room floor. In some cuts of the episode, a scene showing him receiving treatment is shown at around 14 minutes into the show.\\n\\nIn \"This Side of Paradise\" his is the only character to mutiny openly against his superior, Captain Kirk, and even disobeys orders again in \"And the Children Shall Lead,\" although under an alien influence. In \"The City on the Edge of Forever,\" Paskey was the driver of the truck in the scene where character Edith Keeler (Joan Collins) is struck down and killed.\\n\\nPaskey also appeared occasionally as a stand-in for Shatner in certain long scenes. He was the hand-double for James Doohan, who was missing a finger, in \"Wolf in the Fold\" and \"That Which Survives.\" He appeared in most of the episodes from the first two seasons of the original series. A bad back and cluster headaches from an old injury, which worsened from the set lighting, led to his leaving the show in the third season. Paskey admitted in a July 1988 Starlog Magazine interview that once the pain had gone, he tried to return to acting but had lost many of his Hollywood contacts while working on Star Trek, and eventually retired from the profession.\\n\\nAfter retiring from acting, Paskey went into business for himself in Santa Ana, California, owning and operating an auto-detailing service called The Air Shop with his wife Judy. He sold the business in 2004. He and his wife are members of Hot Rods Unlimited, a Southern California auto club. They have four children.\\n\\nPaskey admitted that he considered auditioning for 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture but later reconsidered. He remained a fan of the film series but not the television follow-up Star Trek: The Next Generation, as he explained that \"he went to sleep on it\". In 2004, he appeared in the Star Trek: New Voyages episode \"Come What May\" as Admiral Leslie, a character established as Lieutenant Leslie's father.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edgar Quinet", "body": "thumbEdgar Quinet (February 17, 1803–March 27, 1875) was a French historian and intellectual.\\n\\nBorn at Bourg-en-Bresse, in the département of Ain. His father, Jérôme Quinet, had been a commissary in the army, but being a strong republican and disgusted with Napoleon's 18 Brumaire coup, he gave up his post and devoted himself to scientific and mathematical study. Edgar, who was an only child, was usually alone, but his mother (Eugénie Rozat Lagis, who was an educated person with strong, albeit original, Protestant  religious views) exercised great influence over him. \\n\\nHe was sent to school first in Bourg and then in Lyon. His father wished him on leaving school to go into the army, and then enter a business career. However, Quinet was determined to engage in literature, and after a time got his way when he moved to Paris in 1820 ..\\n\\nHis first publication, the Tablettes du juif errant (\"Tablets of the Wandering Jew\") ,which appeared in 1823, symbolized the progress of humanity  . He became impressed with German intellectual writing and undertook translating Johann Gottfried Herder's Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit (\"Outlines of Philosophy of the History of Man\") learnt German for the purpose, and published his work in 1827, and obtained through it considerable credit.\\n\\nAt this time he was introduced to Victor Cousin, and made the acquaintance of Jules Michelet. He had visited Germany and the United Kingdom before the appearance of his book. Cousin obtained for him a position on a government mission to the Morea, in the Ottoman Empire, in 1829 (during the Greek War of Independence), and on his return he published in 1830 a book on La Grèce moderne (\"Modern Greece\"). With Michelet he published a volume of works denouncing Jesuits and blaming them for religious, political and social troubles in 1843. He also became acquainted with and a lover of the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1838. Quinet wrote several lectures praising Emerson’s works which were published with the title of “Le Christianisme et la Revolution Francaise” in 1945 .\\n\\nHopes of employment which he had after the July Revolution were frustrated by his reputation as a speculative republican. Nonetheless, he joined the staff of the Revue des deux mondes, and for some years contributed to it numerous essays, the most remarkable of which was that on Les Épopées françaises du XIIème siècle, an early, although not the earliest, appreciation of the long-neglected chansons de geste. Ahasverus, his first major original work, appeared in 1833 - it is a singular prose poem.\\n\\nShortly afterwards he married Minna More, a German girl with whom he had fallen in love some years before. Growing disillusioned with German thought due to the Prussian aggressive tactics , he visited Italy, and, besides writing many essays, produced two poems, Napoléon (1835) and Prométhée (1838), both written in verse and seen as inferior to Ahasverus published in 1833. In 1838 he published a strong reply to David Strauss' Leben Jesu, and in that year he received the Legion of Honour. In 1839 he was appointed professor of foreign literature at Lyon, where he began the highly influential course of lectures which formed the basis for his Génie des religions. Two years later he was transferred to the Collège de France, and the Génie des religions, published (1842), he sympathized with all religions but did not favor one above all .\\n\\nQuinet's Paris professorship, which began in 1842, was notorious as the subject of polemics. His chair was that of Southern Literature, but, neglecting his proper subject, he chose, in conjunction with Michelet, to engage in a violent polemic with the Jesuits and with Ultramontanism. Two books bearing exactly these titles appeared in 1843 and 1844, and contained, as was usual with Quinet, the substance of his lectures. \\n\\nThese lectures excited great debate and the author obstinately refused to return to literature-proper; consequently, in 1846, the government put an end to the lectures, a measure which was arguably approved by the majority of his colleagues. He was dismissed in 1846 by the Collège de France due to his adamant attacks on the Roman Catholic Church, exhalation of the revolution, and support for the oppressed nationalities of France and for supporting the theory that religion is a determining force in societies .\\n\\nBy this time Quinet was a pronounced republican, and something of a revolution. He joined the rioters during the 1848 Revolution which overthrew King Louis-Philippe of France, and was elected by the département of Ain to the Constituent and then to the Legislative Assembly, where he affiliated with the extreme radical party. \\n\\nHe had published in 1848 Les Révolutions d'Italie (\"The Revolutions of Italy\"), one of his main works. He wrote numerous pamphlet during the short-lived Second French Republic, attacked the Roman expedition with all his strength and was from the first an uncompromising opponent of Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (Napoleon III).\\n\\nQuinet fled Louis Napoléon’s 1851 coup d’état to Brussels until 1858 and then fled to Veytaux, Switzerland until 1870  . His wife had died some time previously, and he now married Hermione Asachi (or Asaky), the daughter of Gheorghe Asachi, a Moldavia poet. In Brussels, Quinet lived for some seven years, during which he published Les Esclaves (\"The Slaves\", 1853), a dramatic poem, Marnix de Sainte-Aldégonde (1854), a study of the Reformer in which he emphasizes Sainte-Aldégonde's literary merit, and some other books. \\n\\nIn Veytaux, his literary output was greater than ever. In 1860, he published a unique volume, partly reflecting the style of Ahasverus, and entitled Merlin l'enchanteur (Merlin the Enchanter); in 1862, a Histoire de la campagne de 1815 (\"History of the Campaign of 1815\"), in 1865 an elaborate book on the French Revolution, in which the author depicts atrocities carried out by revolutionary forces (causing his rejection by many other partisans of republican ideas). Many pamphlets date from this period, as does La Création (1870), a third book of the genre of Ahasverus and Merlin, but even vaguer - dealing with physical science rather than history, legend, or philosophy for the most part.\\n\\nQuinet had refused to return to France to join the liberal opposition against Napoleon III, but returned immediately after the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. He was then restored to his professorship, and during the siege of Paris wrote vehemently against the Germans. He was elected deputy to the National Assembly by the département of the Seine in 1871, and was one of the most obstinate opponents of the terms of peace between France and Germany. He continued to write till his death, which occurred at Versailles in 1875.\\n\\nLe Siège de Paris et la défense nationale (\"The Siege of Paris and the National Defence\") appeared in 1871, La République (\"The Republic\") in 1872, Le Livre de l'exilé (\"The Book of Exile\") in the year of its author's death and after it. This was followed by three volumes of letters and some other work. Quinet had already in 1858 published a semi-autobiographical book called Histoire de mes idées (\"History of My Ideas\").\\n\\nThe 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' on Quinet:\\n\\n\"His character was extremely amiable, and his letters to his mother, his accounts of his early life, and so forth, are likely always to make him interesting. He was also a man of great moral conscientiousness, and as far as intention went perfectly disinterested. As a writer, his chief fault is want of concentration; as a thinker and politician, vagueness and want of practical determination. His historical and philosophical works, though showing much reading, fertile thought, abundant facility of expression, and occasionally, where prejudice does not come in, acute judgment, are rather (as not a few of them were in fact) reported lectures than formal treatises. His rhetorical power was altogether superior to his logical power, and the natural consequence is that his work is full of contradictions. These contradictions were, moreover, due, not merely to an incapacity or an unwillingness to argue strictly, but also to the presence in his mind of a large number of inconsistent tastes and prejudices which he either could not or would not co-ordinate into an intelligible creed. Thus he has the strongest attraction for the picturesque side of medievalism and catholicity, the strongest repulsion for the restrictions which medieval and Catholic institutions imposed on individual liberty. He refused to submit himself to any form of positive orthodoxy, yet when a man like Strauss pushed unorthodoxy to its extreme limits Quinet revolted.\\n\\nAs a politician he acted with the extreme radicals, yet universal suffrage disgusted him as unreasonable in its principle and dangerous in its results. His pervading characteristic, therefore, is that of an eloquent vagueness, very stimulating and touching at times, but as deficient in coercive force of matter as it is in lasting precision and elegance of form. He is less inaccurate in fact than Michelet, but he is also much less absorbed by a single idea at a time, and the result is that he seldom attains to the vivid representation of which Michelet was a master.\"\\n\\nHis numerous works appeared in a uniform edition of twenty-eight volumes (1877–79). His second wife, in 1870, published certain Mémoires d'exil, and Lettres d'exil followed in 1885. In that year Prof. George Saintsbury published a selection of the Lettres à ma mère (Letters to My Mother) with an introduction.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edgecliff College", "body": "Edgecliff College was a private Catholic women's college located in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was founded in 1935 and merged with Xavier University, also of Cincinnati, in 1980.\\n\\nThe college was founded as Our Lady of Cincinnati College by the Religious Order of the Sisters of Mercy, a Roman Catholic religious order. The college was designed to serve as a replacement for the College of Sacred Heart in Clifton, which had ceased operations. The campus was located on a hill in the Walnut Hills section of the city, which offered students views of northern Kentucky and the Ohio River.\\n\\nEdgecliff received its accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission in 1955. A liberal arts college, a variety of programs of study were offered, including majors in music, art, social work, and nursing. In 1969, the name was changed to Edgecliff College. A year later, the first male students were admitted, making the college fully coeducation.\\n\\nIn the late 1970s, Edgecliff developed an articulation agreement with the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science, which allowed CCMS students to receive their Bachelor's degree at Edgecliff after receiving their diploma and Associate's degree from CCMS. By 1979, the CCMS campus had moved onto the Edgecliff campus, though the two colleges continued to operate as separate institutions.\\n\\nFollowing financial struggles, Edgecliff officially merged with Xavier University on July 1, 1980. The final Edgecliff class graduated in 1984. All student records are now held by Xavier, and services for the more than 3,500 living alumni are organized through the university. Xavier's Alumni Hall was renamed Edgecliff Hall in honor of the college.\\n\\nIn 1986, Xavier closed the Edgecliff campus and sold it to a private developer. The developer wanted to build two condominium towers on the cliff overlooking the Ohio River, but ultimately built only the first 23-story tower and gave the rest of the hillside to the Cincinnati Hillside Trust. The University of Cincinnati bought all of the rest of the land and the academic buildings from the developer, renovated the buildings and added an academic building, and moved its College of Applied Science to the location in 1988 from its historic home at the Emery Building (Walnut and Central Parkway).\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edgerton Park Arena", "body": "Edgerton Park Arena was an indoor arena in Rochester, New York. The building was originally constructed in 1892 as the drill hall for a training school for delinquent boys. When the school moved in the early part of the 20th century the building was turned into an indoor sports arena and exhibition hall. An artificial ice-making system was installed in 1935.\\n\\nThe first professional team to use the building was the Rochester Cardinals hockey team in 1935-36. The Cardinals played in the International Hockey League and were a farm team of the New York Americans of the National Hockey League. Rochester could have been a charter member of the International-American Hockey League which formed in the summer of 1936 upon the merger of the I.H.L. and the Canadian-American Hockey Leagues. However, the Cardinals went into receivership before the end of the 1935-36 season and no suitable owner could be found to continue to operate the team. Also the arena sat only 3,500 for hockey and officials of the new league wanted a minimum seating capacity of at least 5,000 fans. The City of Rochester, the arena's owners, refused to expand the building. The refusal to expand the building meant Rochester would have to wait until the Community War Memorial Arena (now Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial) opened in 1955 to join the American Hockey League. Rochester was awarded a new franchise in the American Hockey League in 1956 after Pittsburgh withdrew. The Rochester Americans began play in the 1956-57 season.\\n\\nIn 1940 the International-American Hockey League changed its name to the American Hockey League. The A.H.L. is now the premier Class AAA minor league in professional hockey.\\n\\nIt was the primary home of the NBA's Rochester Royals from 1945 to 1955. The Royals moved into the new Rochester Community War Memorial for the 1955-56 N.B.A. season. But because of periodic scheduling conflicts and the two-month long 1956 American Bowling Congress Finals scheduled for the War Memorial the Royals would return to the Sports Arena to play several games during the '55-'56 season. It also hosted performances by the Glenn Miller Orchestra and cowboy star Gene Autry in the 1940s. The arena held 4,200 people for basketball. The building was demolished in the late 1950s.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edina Monsoon", "body": "Edina Monsoon is the main character in the BBC programme Absolutely Fabulous, played by Jennifer Saunders, who is also the creator of the show. The character is known for her extravagance and various attempts to follow new crazes and trends.\\n\\nEdina was born Edwina Margaret Rose Monsoon on 6 August 1951 in London; her parents' only child. She later changed her name to Edina and is nearly always called Eddy; only her mother and ex-husband Justin call her Edwina. According to Patsy, Eddie's teenage nickname was \"The Shredder\" due to her addiction to eating \"huge amounts of tissue\"; \"whole toilet rolls\", Eddie's ex-husband Justin verified.\\n\\nEdina is the owner of a (barely) successful metropolitan PR company. It seems that this stems partly from her being at the right places at the right times, and around the right people, from the late sixties to early eighties. In several episodes, including \"Fashion\" and \"The Last Shout\", Edina demonstrates the creativity, organisational ability and shrewd business sense that have made her successful.\\n\\nEddy's self-image is based on 1960s counterculture and the world of fashion and celebrity. She is fixated on self-indulgence and her ideas of self-actualisation. Eddy subscribes to every trend that arises, including New Age spirituality—she calls herself a Buddhist—and feng shui. She aspires to move in the highest circles of creativity, fashion, and celebrity. She considers herself a follower of the latest trends, but, having no real sense of style of her own, Eddy is actually a fashion victim, parading the latest fashion trends without understanding them or understanding what looks good on her. She is a die-hard fan of Christian Lacroix and is quick to point out \"it's a Lacroix, darling\".\\n\\nShe lives in a nice Holland Park house, which she claims cost £1.5m, (see episode 'Hospital' series 2) with her daughter Saffy, and owns a public relations firm whose only steady client is 1960s pop singer Lulu, whose professional relationship with Edina is hanging by a thread. In later years, this was switched to model Twiggy and Spice Girl Emma Bunton, who also went to school with Saffy.\\n\\nEdina is desperate to give off the aura of success, wealth and fabulousness. Her outrageous but always expensive wardrobe is one of her ways of doing this, as is the constant renovating of her home. She is extremely status conscious, loudly clarifying that her house is in Holland Park whenever someone identifies the neighbourhood as Shepherd's Bush.\\n\\nIn an early episode, Edina says that she has always voted Labour, but she notes her disdain for New Labour in the 4th season. She collects hefty alimony payments from her two ex-husbands, Justin and Marshall. Saffy's father Justin is homosexual and for a time has a boyfriend named Oliver, who runs an antique shop with him. Marshall Turtle, Eddy's second husband, is the father of her homosexual and almost perpetually off-screen son Serge. Marshall later marries brash, scheming New-Age California Bo Chrysalis (Gaffney), who effortlessly rules over him. There is confusion about the order in which Edina married her husbands, but she states in the 2005 episode \"Gay\" after marrying Patsy in a mock civil partnership that her spouses were \"Gay man, straight man, woman\" and other references in the same story suggest Justin is her first husband. Yet it also appears that Serge - her son with Marshall - is older than Saffy, her daughter with Justin.\\n\\nHomosexual men play an important role in Edina's social self-image, as tokens of fashionability and political correctness. She asserts the former by claiming that \"gay men love [her]\" and the latter by claiming that \"all [her] friends are gay\". However, on one occasion, she seconds Patsy's accusation of a \"gay mafia\" conspiracy to explain their professional failures. In one episode, Patsy and Eddie marry in an unofficial civil partnership in New York. Although Eddie was unwilling at first, she beseeched Patsy to be married to her for the remainder of the holiday, explaining she'd never even come back from her honeymoon and still been married.\\n\\nEdina claims to be a Buddhist, practising, in her words, \"almost religiously\". She also identifies as a vegetarian although she is seen eating meat on a few occasions. For dramatic purposes she had been described as being two stone (28 pounds) overweight. She frequently moans about being too fat; however, she hasn't the willpower to stay on any diet for long. She often says that one method she has used is to go shopping for clothes two sizes too small for her. Weak-willed as she is, she spends much of her life caught in an emotional tug of war between Patsy, her lifelong friend and corrupter, and Saffy, her sensible goody-two-shoes daughter.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Editology", "body": "The editology (in French: éditologie) is the epistemological system developed by the Belgian philosopher Jean C. Baudet. The main characteristic of the editology is to define the knowledge as a set of texts, discourses (and thus terms), and to assign the scientificity of those texts to the very conditions of their edition - the manner they are accepted by the international scientific community. We can say that the editology has two purposes: understand the terms (terminology) and analyze the edition (editology sensu stricto).This philosophical approach leads to a conception of the knowledge (an truth) which admits that the hard core of rationalism (logic) is the epistemological complex STI (Science-Technics-Industry). An important consequence of the editological thought is to establish an historical critic of the successive discourses which characterize the milestones of the human thinking: literature, religion, and later philosophy. In that sense, the philosophy is defined as a discourse rejecting all the discourses. Indeed, we can say that the philosophy began with Thales of Milet, when he threw back all the traditions.The editology is an historical epistemology, quite based on the practice of history of science, of religions, and of other cultural productions.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edlington", "body": "Edlington is a town and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England, lying to the south west of Doncaster. It has a population of 8,276. The original parish town of Edlington is now known as Old Edlington; adjacent, and to the north, is New Edlington.\\n\\nSince 1974 Edlington has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster in the metropolitan county of South Yorkshire. It had, since 1894, formed part of Doncaster Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire.\\n\\nDuring the final stages of the last Ice Age, a period known as the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic Periods, Edlington was a place of settlement for the Palaeolithic groups of early nomadic humans. The groups had followed the improving climate northwards as the Ice Sheets covering Europe retreated. In 2003 the South Yorkshire Archaeological Survey found compelling evidence that these early groups of Humans had been using caves and natural outcrops in Edlington wood as shelters and bases for hunting. Additionally quantities of flint tools from the period were unearthed near to a Rock Shelter in the wood. During the period in which the tools can be dated the landscape of the area was a vast treeless tundra, with forestation occurring only as late into the period as 7500 BC.\\n\\nEdlington along with the areas known locally as Rossington, Bawtry and Hatfield are the only areas within Doncaster that show these early signs of Human Occupation.\\n\\nThe name Edlington which pre-dates the Norman conquest of England is evidence of some former consequence: /Kpniinj tun, the town of the Atheling. The Atheling being an Old English term (æþeling) used in Anglo-Saxon England to designate Princes of the Royal Dynasty who were eligible for the Kingship. Variations such as Ætheling, Atheling or Etheling appear in many English place names, attributing land ownership to the Atheling. Local Legend holds Athlane, the Dane to be the landowner of the ancient residence in the town.\\n\\nEdlington is recorded in the Domesday Book which is a highly detailed survey and valuation of all the land held by the King William The Conquerer and his chief tenants, along with all the resources that went with the land in late 11th century England. Edlington was known in these times as Eilintone and Ellintone.\\n\\nAmong the persons named in the entry for Old Edlington were among others Aubrey de Coucy, Earl of Northumbria, Ilbert de Lacy, Roger de Busli, Walter D'Aincourt, William 1st Baron Percy and William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey.\\n\\nSt Peter's Church dates from the late 12th century, when the Norman style was becoming Transitional, and it is considered a masterpiece of curious Norman carvings and has a chancel arch decorated with several rows of chevrons. The upper stage of the tower and the north chapel are Perpendicular. A Norman corbel table runs along the south exterior wall, with a variety of carved figures depicting grotesque beasts and human heads. There is a similar corbel table with carved figures inside the church, between the aisle and nave. The interior has 17th century brasses and pillars with basket and leaf decoration. There is a 15th screen, examples of Jacobean woodwork, and a font dated 1599.\\n\\nThis church was declared redundant in 1962 when its parish was united with that of New Edlington, creating the new Title of Old Edlington. After suffering years of uncertainty and vandalism, this building was the first church to be vested in the Churches Conservation Trust in 1971.\\n\\nThe Edlington (Yorkshire) Land and Development Company Limited, and the partnership which preceded it, was responsible for building a substantial part of the colliery village of New Edlington between 1909 and about 1922. The village was built to house the workers who moved into the area on the sinking of the Yorkshire Main Colliery. \\n\\nThe colliery was created by the Staveley Coal and Iron Company, which bought land in Edlington and leased the right to exploit the coal reserves under this and adjoining land from the Battie-Wrightson of Cusworth estate in several transactions in 1909 and 1910. William Wrightson of Cusworth had acquired the Edlington estate in 1803 from the Molesworth family, which had owned it since the late 17th century.\\n\\nThe Land and Development Company (and its satellite, the Edlington Co-operative Tenants Ltd.), built the streets on the north-west of Edlington Lane, bounded by Victoria Road to the north, Gordon Road to the south, and St John's Road and Church Road to the east. (It also purchased Staveley Street, to the north of Victoria Road from the original developer). Altogether, the estate as defined by deeds deposited at the National Archives comprised 557 houses and sixteen shops when completed. \\n\\nThe area to the south of Main Avenue was developed by an organisation called the Edlington Co-operative Tenants Ltd. This purchased the  of land, which eventually supported 200 houses, from the Land and Development Company in October 1914. However, it appears that this organisation was essentially the Land and Development Company in another guise, as the membership of its board was identical with that of the Land and Development Company. This may have been done to make it easier to obtain the mortgage funds necessary to build the houses.\\n\\nEdlington Halt was a small Railway Station on the eastern terminus of the Dearne Valley Railway. The halt's first title was originally \"Edlington for Balby Doncaster\" (with the words 'for' and 'Doncaster' in lettering at half size compared to the others). It was built to serve the mining village of Edlington where the local mine, Yorkshire Main Colliery had been sunk and the surrounding Doncaster suburbs including that of Balby in South Yorkshire, England.\\n\\nLike many other Railway Stations across the Dearne Valley region, it consisted of beds of sleepers all set at track level. The large station sign was removed in the late 1920s and replaced by a simple \"Edlington\" sign instead. The station was opened for passengers on 3 June 1912 and ceased on 10 September 1951.\\n\\nEdlington Wood is a 99.7 hectare site located at Grid Ref: SK 549980 an altitude of 45–80 meters some 4 km to the south west of Doncaster; this is the largest single unit of predominantly deciduous woodland on the magnesian limestone in South Yorkshire. It includes large areas of ancient woodland dating from Romano-British times and supports extremely rich plant and animal communities which reflect the site's antiquity, history of forest management, diversity of soil types and moisture conditions. Edlington Wood was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIS) in 1979.\\n\\nNew Edlington Brickpit is a 0.2 hectare site located at Grid Ref: SK 531988 that consists of one face of a disused brickpit. The face is composed of clays and mudstones formed some 255 million years ago, in the Permian period. Above these, is a deposit known as dolomite, a rock similar to limestone, but rich in magnesium that is over 8 meters thick at the brickpit. The rocks exposed in the brickpit represent the best available exposure of their type and the site is of special research interest because it enables geologists to understand the conditions of the period. In addition, the site is recognised and used by geologists throughout Britain as the standard reference locality for these rocks. The site was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIS) in 1989.\\n\\nEdlington Wood contains the site of an ancient Roman Settlement, which is scheduled as an Ancient Monument and considered to be a 'nationally important' archaeological site. The Settlement remains are designated and afforded protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. English Heritage also listed the site under the \"Heritage at Risk Register 2009.\" The condition of the site is generally satisfactory, but it is considered at risk of further degradation due to significant localised problems. The site is expected to further decline in the future.\\n\\nright\\n\\nViscount Robert Molesworth The First and his wife Lady Letitia Molesworth both lived in the property now known as Blow Hall Manor in the grounds of Edlington Wood in the late 17th century until the mid 18th century. Viscount Molesworth was also a Member of Parliament for the West Riding of Yorkshire electoral area now known as Don Valley (UK Parliament constituency) and a Peerage of Ireland in the House of Lords.\\n\\nRobert is said to have held great affection for his trusted companion a snow-white greyhound. The greyhound travelled constantly by his master's side, including the long trips between London, Ireland and Edlington. \\n\\nTradition and legend recalls that one day when Robert was working in the gardens of his Edlington estate, he made his way to the outside toilet when the dog pulled on his masters coat flap, and would not let him proceed. On a second attempt, the dog behaved in the same manner. Surprised at this interruption, he ordered one of his gardeners to go ahead to the outside toilet and on opening the door, was immediately shot dead by a villain there concealed, whose intention was most probably, to rob the house when the family was retired for the night.\\n\\nOn the death of this hound years later, Robert had a monument erected to its memory. It was beneath a fine yew tree in the grounds of Blow Hall Manor in Edlington Wood, and consisted of an urn supported by a square pedestal. In the front of which was inserted a dab of white marble, on which is carved in bas-relief a figure of the dog, and also the following inscription, composed, it is said, by Dr. Lockyer Dean, of Peterborough. \\n\\nThe Latin inscription translated reads \"Stay, traveler, Nor wonder that a lamented Dog Is thus interred with funeral honour. But ah, what a dog ! His beautiful form and snow-white colour, Pleasing manners and sportful playfulness, Affection, obedience, and fidelity, Made him the delight of his master, To whose side he closely adhered. With his eager companions of the chase, He delighted in attending him. Whenever the mind of his lord was depressed, He would assume fresh spirit and animation. A master, not ungrateful for his merits, Has here in tears deposited his remains In this marble urn.\" In the Year 1714.\\n\\nYorkshire Main Colliery was a coal mine situated within the village of Edlington.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nSt. John the Baptist, Parish Church in Edlington is an Anglican Church, in the Diocese of Sheffield which forms part of the Church of England. The church is located at the junction of Main Avenue and St John's Road. \\n\\nAdditionally the church is registered as a Forward in Faith parish under the Sacramental care of the Bishop of Beverley, after it passed resolutions A, B & C which means that only male priests may preside to conduct mass. \\n\\nThe church is open for Mass on Sundays from 9.30 am, Mondays from 10.00 am, Tuesday's from 7.00 pm, Wednesday's from 10.00 am, Fridays from 12.00 noon and is closed on Thursdays and Saturdays.\\n\\nThe church is currently working on a restoration project to restore the Church to its former glory, when it was originally opened shortly after the opening of Yorkshire Main Colliery in the 1920s. The cost to replace the roof of the church is estimated to be in the order of £30,000 and was due to be completed during the Autumn of 2009.\\n\\nEdlington Methodist Church is Located on Main Avenue.\\n\\nSt Mary's Catholic Church in Edlington is located within the grounds of St Mary's Catholic Primary School on Bungalow Road.\\n\\nThe Antiochian Orthodox parish of St. Columba and St. Kentigern in Edlington is located at the top of Staveley Street.\\n\\nWarmsworth and New Edlington National Spiritualist Church in Edlington is located on Edlington Lane, off Warmsworth Halt.\\n\\nAt the start of 2009, Edlington was featured in the regional news as a fire broke out inside the then disused Edlington School. Pupils had left the school for the Christmas holidays but the adjacent new school they were due to move into, Sir Thomas Wharton Community College, was not directly damaged.

{"title": "Edman degradation", "body": "Edman degradation, developed by Pehr Edman, is a method of sequencing amino acids in a peptide. In this method, the amino-terminal residue is labeled and cleaved from the peptide without disrupting the peptide bonds between other amino acid residues. \\n\\n600px\\n\\nPhenylisothiocyanate is reacted with an uncharged terminal amino group, under mildly alkaline conditions, to form a cyclical phenylthiocarbamoyl derivative. Then, under acidic conditions, this derivative of the terminal amino acid is cleaved as a thiazolinone derivative. The thiazolinone amino acid is then selectively extracted into an organic solvent and treated with acid to form the more stable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)- amino acid derivative that can be identified by using chromatography or electrophoresis. This procedure can then be repeated again to identify the next amino acid. A major drawback to this technique is that the peptides being sequenced in this manner cannot have more than 50 to 60 residues (and in practice, under 30). The peptide length is limited due to the cyclical derivitization not always going to completion. The derivitization problem can be resolved by cleaving large peptides into smaller peptides before proceeding with the reaction. It is able to accurately sequence up to 30 amino acids with modern machines capable of over 99% efficiency per amino acid. An advantage of the Edman degradation is that it only uses 10 - 100 pico of peptide for the sequencing process. Edman degradation reaction is automated to speed up the process.\\n\\nBecause the Edman degradation proceeds from the N-terminus of the protein, it will not work if the N-terminal amino acid has been chemically modified or if it is concealed within the body of the protein. It also requires the use of either guesswork or a separate procedure to determine the positions of disulfide bridges.\\n\\nFollowing 2D SDS PAGE the proteins can be transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) blotting membrane for further analysis. Edman degradations can be performed directly from a PVDF membrane. N-terminal residue sequencing resulting in five to ten amino acid may be subsequent to identity a Protein of Interest (POI).\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eduardo Paolozzi", "body": "thumb\\n\\nSir Eduardo Luigi Paolozzi, KBE, RA (7 March 1924 – 22 April 2005), was a Scottish sculptor and artist. He was a major figure in the international art world working without compromise on his own interpretation and vision of the world around us all. Paolozzi investigated how we can fit into the modern world to resemble our fragmented civilization through imagination and fantasy. By the dramatic juxtaposition of ideas in his work, he let us see the confusion as well as the inspiration.\\n\\nthumbPaolozzi was born 7 March 1924, in Leith in north Edinburgh, Scotland and was the eldest son of Italian immigrants. In June 1940, when Italy declared war on Britain, Paolozzi was interned (along with most other Italian men in Britain). During his three-month internment at Saughton prison his father, grandfather and uncle, who had also been detained, were among the 446 Italians who drowned when the ship carrying them to Canada, the Arandora Star, was sunk by a German U-boat. \\n\\nPaolozzi studied at the Edinburgh College of Art in 1943, briefly at the St Martin's School of Art in 1944, and then at the Slade School of Fine Art at University College London from 1944 to 1947, after which he worked in Paris, France. While in Paris from 1947–1949, Paolozzi became acquainted with Alberto Giacometti, Jean Arp, Constantin Brancusi, Georges Braque and Fernand Léger. This period became an important influence for his later work.\\n\\nAfter Paris, he moved back to London eventually establishing his studio in Chelsea. The studio was a work-shop filled with hundreds of found objects, models, sculptures, materials, tools, toys and stacks of books. Paolozzi was interested in everything and would use a variety of objects and materials in his work, particularly his collages. Largely a surrealist, Paolozzi came to public attention in the 1950s by producing a range of striking screenprint and ′Art Brut′ sculpture. Paolozzi was a founder of the Independent Group in 1952, which is regarded as the precursor to the mid 1950s British and late 1950s American Pop Art movements. His seminal 1947 collage I was a Rich Man's Plaything is considered the earliest standard bearer representing Pop Art. He always described his work as surrealist art and, while working in a wide range of media though his career, became more closely associated with sculpture. Paolozzi is recognized for producing largely lifelike statuary works, but with rectilinear (often cubic) elements added or removed, or the human form deconstructed in a cubist manner.\\n\\nHe taught sculpture and ceramics at a number of institutions, including University of California, Berkeley (in 1968) and at the Royal College of Art. Paolozzi has a long association with Germany, having worked in Berlin from 1974 as part of the Artists Exchange Scheme. He was a professor at the Fachhochschule in Cologne from 1977 to 1981, and later taught sculpture at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich. Paolozzi was fond of Munich and many of his works and concept plans were developed in a studio he kept there, including the mosaics of the Tottenham Court Road Station in London. He took a stab at industrial design in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of the upscale Suomi tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Paolozzi decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker's Studio Linie.\\n\\nPaolozzi was awarded the CBE in 1968 and in 1979 he was elected to the Royal Academy. During the late 60s he started contributing to literary magazine Ambit, which began a lifelong collaboration. \\n\\nHe was promoted to the office of Her Majesty's Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland in 1986, which he held until his death. Paolozzi was knighted in 1989 by Queen Elizabeth II and awarded the KBE.\\n\\nPaolozzi was a great friend of Peter Boizot, the founder of Pizza Express restaurants and jazz rooms (before it became a plc) and the Soho Jazz Festival. Boizot bought and commissioned several works for his businesses including the launch image for the first Soho Jazz Festival in 1986.\\n\\nIn 1994 Paolozzi gave the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art a large body of his works, and much of the content of his artist's studio. In 1999 the National Galleries of Scotland opened the Dean Gallery to display this collection, and the gallery displays a recreation of Paolozzi's studio, with its contents evoking the original London and Munich locations.\\n\\nIn 2001 Paolozzi suffered a near-fatal stroke (causing an incorrect magazine report that he had died). The illness confined him to a wheelchair, and he died in a hospital in London in April 2005.\\n\\nthumbthumb• The mosaic patterned walls of the Tottenham Court Road tube station\\n\\n• The cover of Paul McCartney's album Red Rose Speedway\\n\\n• The ceiling panels and window tapestry at Cleish Castle\\n\\n• The \"Piscator\" sculpture outside Euston Station London\\n\\n• Relief aluminium doors for the University of Glasgow's Hunterian Gallery\\n\\n• The bronze sculpture Newton, after William Blake, 1995, in the piazza of the British Library\\n\\n• The Manuscript of Monte Casino, an open palm, a section of limb and a human foot, located at Leith Walk, looking towards Paolozzi's birthplace Leith\\n\\n• The \"Head of Invention\" sculpture on the South Bank in front of the Design Museum\\n\\n• The sculpture \"A Maximis Ad Minima\" in Kew Gardens at the west end of the Princess of Wales Conservatory.\\n\\n• The mosaics in Redditch Town Centre.\\n\\n• The \"Athena\" sculpture in the Art Centre at the London Oratory School, Fulham.\\n\\n• The \"Faraday\" sculpture at the University of Birmingham.\\n\\n"}

Valfierno paid several men to steal the work of art from the Louvre, including museum employee Vincenzo Peruggia. On August 21, 1911 Peruggia hid the Mona Lisa under his coat and simply walked out the door. \\n\\nBefore the heist took place, Valfierno commissioned French art restorer and forger Yves Chaudron to make six copies of the Mona Lisa. The forgeries were then shipped to various parts of the world, readying them for the buyers he had lined up. Valfierno knew once the Mona Lisa was stolen it would be harder to smuggle copies past customs. After the heist the copies were delivered to their buyers, each thinking they had the original which had just been stolen for them. Because Valfierno just wanted to sell forgeries, he only needed the original Mona Lisa to disappear and never contacted Peruggia again after the crime. Eventually Peruggia was caught trying to sell the painting and it was returned to the Louvre in 1913.\\n\\nPeruggia denied he ever knew Valfierno other than a chance meeting at the Louvre.\\n\\nThe notion of stealing the Mona Lisa and making six copies to sell to private collectors is similar to a plot element in the Doctor Who story \"City of Death\" - although in the script, which relies on time travel, Leonardo himself is forced to make copies of his own work, which would then be sold in the 1970s.\\n\\nThis Con was also mentioned in the Leverage episode \"The Two Live Crew Job\" where a rival crew steals a painting the Leverage Crew was looking for. Described as the \"Mona Lisa Variant\" Parker claims this was the first con she learned and explains it for the viewing audience.\\n\\nIn the 2007 film St Trinian's, the girls use a similar scheme with the painting Girl With A Pearl Earring: they make a copy of the picture, steal the original, sell the copy for £500 000, return the original (claiming to have found it in a Harvey Nichols changing room) and claim the £500 000 reward (In deleted scenes they refer to it as 'borrowing').

{"title": "Education in Birmingham", "body": "thumb\\n\\nThis article is about education in Birmingham, England.\\n\\nright in the rest of England and Wales, education is compulsory in Birmingham between the ages of 5 and 16. The majority of children are educated in state school which follow the National Curriculum. These are divided into primary schools for children from Reception to Year 6 (5 to 11) and secondary schools for children from Year 7 to Year 11 (11 to 16). Most secondary schools in Birmingham also have a sixth form (Years 12 and 13), but sixth form education is also provided in a number of sixth form college and further education college.\\n\\nMost of Birmingham's state schools are community school run directly by Birmingham City Council in its role as local education authority (LEA). However, there are a large number of voluntary aided schools within the state system, primarily Roman Catholic schools, but also schools whose religious basis is Anglican, Jew and Islam and schools which are non-denominational. In addition, there are a number of foundation school in Birmingham (which were formerly grant maintained school) which enjoy greater independence from the LEA than community schools.\\n\\nMost state secondary schools in Birmingham are comprehensive, but a number of historic grammar school, among them Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, Handsworth Grammar School and Sutton Coldfield Grammar School for Girls and the grammar schools of the Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI, survived the policy of moving to a comprehensive system in the 1960s and 1970s - mostly due to the historical accident of their exact legal relationship with the LEA.\\n\\nright minority of Birmingham's children attend private schools which range from small institutions to historic schools of national prestige such as King Edward's School. King Edwards Birmingham is widely recognised as one of the best schools in the UK, despite achieving A-Level and GCSE results inferior to those of their foundation counterparts in Birmingham. Notably, the King Edward VI Camp Hill Schools, in Kings Heath both achieve the best results of the King Edward schools within Birmingham.\\n\\nSeven schools in Birmingham are to become academies in an attempt to improve the learning experience. As of July 2007, five schools have signed deals with sponsors and education charities. ARK Academies and Edutrust invested £4m and are to run two academies each. Richardsons Capital LLP will run the other academy. A further two more schools were in need of sponsors. ARK Academies are to run St Alban's CE Academy and Harborne Hill, whilst Edutrust will run Heartlands High and Shenley Court. Kings Norton High will be run by Richardsons Capital. College High School will be run in partnership with Edutrust and Aston Villa F.C.\\n\\nrightBirmingham has several colleges of further education funded primarily by the Learning and Skills Council, including City College, Josiah Mason College, Cadbury College, Queen Alexandra College, Bournville College, and Birmingham Metropolitan College. Several of these also offer courses in higher education in conjunction with external colleges and universities.\\n\\nIn addition to the numerous institutions which offer education primarily to full-time students and to those pursuing vocational development, there are a wide number of courses aimed primarily at part-time and recreational learners. The city council's Birmingham Adult Educational Service (BAES) offers around 4000 different courses each year at around 70 different centres in diverse subjects such as foreign languages, information technology, mathematics, literacy and various types of creative arts. Some courses allow the students to achieve qualifications such as GCSE and A-levels. BAES also provides teaching in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) for the many inhabitants of the city who do not speak English as a mother-tongue.\\n\\nSimilar courses are offered by many of the city's further education colleges, and various arts organisations such as the mac offer workshops in the creative arts. Experienced musicians from ground roots enterprises such as Punch Records in The Custard Factory host many 'Urban Workshops' for modern music including street-level DJ mixing tuition and dance.\\n\\nBirmingham is home to three universities; the University of Birmingham (founded 1900), Aston University (founded 1966), and Birmingham City University (formerly Birmingham Polytechnic, awarded university status in 1992). It also has two university colleges: Newman University College, which specialises in teacher training, and University College Birmingham. Both of these also receive funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England.\\n\\nthumbBirmingham City University (BCU) in particular has a significant role in higher education in the arts in Birmingham. The Birmingham Conservatoire, now part of the university, was formed as the Birmingham School of Music in 1859 and formerly constituted in 1886. It is one of only nine conservatoire in the United Kingdom and the only one which is also a university faculty. The conservatoire has strong links with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra whose former conductor, Simon Rattle, is the conservatoire's president. The conservatoire is planning to move from their current location in Adrian Boult Hall to a site in the Eastside.\\n\\nThe Birmingham Institute of Art and Design (BIAD), another faculty of BCU, is one of the largest faculties of art, design and media education in the United Kingdom. BIAD includes the Bournville Centre for Visual Arts, the Birmingham School of Art and the School of Jewellery (in the Jewellery Quarter), which highlights the importance of jewellery manufacture in the city.\\n\\nBirmingham School of Acting, founded in 1936, is one of the United Kingdom's leading vocational drama schools, offering higher education courses in drama as well as a range of part time, summer schools and short courses for adults and children. Its merger with BCU was announced in June 2005.\\n\\nElmhurst School for Dance is the oldest vocational dance school in the United Kingdom and offers dance training and academic education to pupils of secondary school age. The school was originally located in Camberley, Surrey but after becoming an associate school of the Birmingham Royal Ballet in 2002, it relocated to Edgbaston in Birmingham in 2004.\\n\\nThe city council is also responsible for the provision of libraries throughout the city. There are 41 local libraries in addition to Birmingham Central Library, reputedly one of the largest public libraries in Europe. According to city council figures, Birmingham's library system has over 2.7 million books and receives over 4 million visitors each year.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Education in Mauritius", "body": "The education system in Mauritius is largely based on the British system since Mauritius was a former British colony. After the country became independent in 1968, education became one of the main preoccupations of the Mauritian Government to meet the new challenges awaiting the country. Considerable investment of resources, both human and material, has been put into theEducation sector and impressive progress has lbeen achieved in terms of free, universal, compulsory primary education, free textbooks, free secondary education and a fairly wide range of higher education courses at the University of Mauritius. \\n\\nEducation has been free through the secondary level since 1976 and through the post-secondary level since 1988. The government has made an effort to provide adequate funding for education, occasionally straining tight budgets and even subsidised a great part of the expenditure in the Private Confessional schools, that is, schools under the control of the Catholic Church. However, the pre-primary schools are still privately owned.\\n\\nMauritius has a population of about 1.2 million inhabitants of whom the majority are from Indian origin. The population of African origin is the second largest population in Mauritius, and small sections of the population are of Chinese and French origins. \\n\\nThe medium of instruction in schools is English, since the impact of colonialism is still very present.English is the official language of Mauritius but the majority of the population speaks the French-based Mauritian Creole in their everyday interactions. However, the teaching of some Asian languages (Hindi, Urdu, Mandarin Chinese and Arabic) is also included in the curriculum. The education system consists of the Primary and Secondary sectors.\\n\\nChildren are enrolled in primary school from the age of five and enter Standard I and move automatically up to Standard VI. The system is highly competitive and a two-year preparation starts since Standard V up to Standard VI for the end of primary school examinations, the CPE (Certificate of Primary Education). The CPE is a national examination carried out in all the schools of the island following a grading system. Five subjects are compulsory and taken into account for the ranking process; English, French, Mathematics, Science, and History and Geography. The Asian languages are included in the grading process. \\n\\nThis examination was like a bottleneck from primary to secondary schools, when the ranking system was in force (expounded in the next paragraph). For instance, out of 25,629 candidates in 1996, 16,737 passed all grades included (Ministry of Education and Scientific Research, 1998). Among them, only about 8,000 were admitted to secondary schools, both State and Private of the island, and some 3,000 found their way to Basic Prevocational or technical school. Over 14,000 students were said to be, ‘left without a future’. This was due to a shortage of secondary schools. However, as from 2001, a large number of secondary schools has been constructed and all students who have passed the CPE examinations have the possibility to enroll in a secondary school. The system no longer causes a large number of students to be left out.\\n\\nBefore 2001, children were admitted to secondary schools or colleges solely on the basis of national ranking. That created an enormous disparity among the different colleges of the island. For instance, some colleges were deemed to be \"star\" schools whilst others were regarded as 'less-performing' schools. However, it should be noted that the quality of education provided in all schools is the same. The main difference lies in the star schools' reputation and prestige which is based primarily on the laureateship system at HSC level.\\n\\nIn 2001, the government in power — with Steven Obeegadoo acting as minister of education — decided to abolish this system. Instead, a grading system was introduced. Moreover, it was coupled with a regionalisation system which advocates obtaining a school near one's residence. The system is still in use today but a new system, the 'A+' has been added. This system is similar to the ranking system of pre-2001, but instead of giving an individual rank to each pupil, it serves as a means to obtain admission into schools officially called 'National Colleges', previously considered 'star schools'. In this system, children sitting for the CPE exam are offered the possibility to attend a regional school or a national school. Parents can choose if they want their children to compete for a much coveted star-school seat or go to a regional school. This system has been criticised by education experts as being unfair and creating a discrepancy between students. \\n\\nAs has been mentioned earlier, the CPE determines admission to a secondary college. Most of the colleges whether they are State owned or privately owned are like English-style grammar schools. The child enters college in Form I and progresses through to Form VI, requiring seven years of schooling since there is two years preparation for the A-Level examinations. From Form I to III, there is no major nationally devised curriculum since each school has to plan its work according to the level of the students. However, some subjects are compulsory, like English, French, Mathematics, Sciences and Social Studies (including Geography and History). \\n\\nWhen students reach Form IV, they have to choose at least six major subjects for their O-Level examinations. Then students have to specialise in 3 main subjects and 2 subsidiary ones for the A Level examination. The O-Level and A-Level examinations are carried out by the University of Cambridge through University of Cambridge International Examinations, which devises the syllabus; prepares and prints the examinations papers and does the correction for a few subjects only.\\n\\n</center>\\n\\nSource: Central Statistics Office (Mauritius) Document\\n\\nIn 2007, a total of 52,760 candidates took part in exams at the primary and secondary level. At the primary level, 28,234 took part in Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) exams while at the secondary level, 17,114 candidates took part in School Certificate (S.C) exams. 8,926 candidates took part in Higher School Certificate (H.S.C) exams.\\n\\nTertiary education which started in 1924 with the College of Agriculture has since developed into a diversified system, composed of public, private, regional and overseas institutions catering for a wide range of courses and programmes.\\n\\nTertiary education in Mauritius is characterized by a wide range of institutions with diverse characteristics. Some provide all levels of tertiary education in a range of disciplines while others focus their activities on only one or two areas at certain levels. A number of the institutions are overseas with their provisions made available through the distance education mode. Within the public sector, tertiary education revolves around the University of Mauritius (UoM), the University of Technology (UTM), the Mauritius Institute of Education (MIE), the Mahatma Gandhi Institute (MGI) and the Mauritius College of the Air (MCA). Overseeing the four tertiary education institutions (TEIs) is the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) which, inter alia, has responsibility for allocating public funds, and fostering, planning and coordinating the development of post-secondary education and training. \\n\\nTwo Polytechnics, managed by the Technical School Management Trust Fund (TSMTF) also operate within the public sector. They are namely the Swami Dayanand Institute of Management (ex. Droopnath Ramphul Polytechnic) and the Institut Superieur de Technologie\" (ex. Institut Polytechnique de Rose-Hill). The Industrial and Vocational Training Board (IVTB) and the Mauritius Institute of Health (MIH) equally dispense tertiary level programmes in selected areas.\\n\\nIn addition to the above publicly-funded institutions (PFIs), an estimated 35 private institutions and 50 overseas institutions/bodies are presently delivering tertiary-level programmes, mostly in niche areas like Information Technology, Law, Management, Accountancy and Finance. A majority of these private institutions operate on a part-time basis, in the evenings, weekends and on some weekdays with relatively small student cohorts. Most, if not all, of the programmes are those of overseas institutions. These are being offered by franchise agreements whereby the overseas institutions provide programme materials and/or tutorial support. Apart from playing an administrative role, the local partners also provide tutorial support and in certain cases local institutions deliver programmes using exclusively their own resources. The local tertiary education scene also comprises four tertiary education institutions with a regional vocation, namely the University of the Indian Ocean (UIO), the \"Institut de la Francophonie Pour L’Entrepreneuriat\" (IFE), the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Medical College (SSRMC) and the Mauras College of Dentistry (MCD). The activities of these institutions are geared towards programmes in very limited or specific disciplines. \\n\\nThe provision of tertiary education extends beyond the local tertiary education institutions given that a significant number of Mauritian students either go overseas or resort exclusively to the open learning mode for pursuing their studies.\\n\\nStarting as the College of Agriculture, the UoM, established in 1965, dominates the Tertiary Education Sector locally. Originally, it had three Schools, namely Agriculture, Administration and Industrial Technology. It has since expanded to comprise five Faculties, namely Agriculture, Engineering, Law and Management, Science, and Social Studies & Humanities. It has also a Centre for Medical Research and Studies, a Centre for Distance Education, a Centre for Innovative Learning Technologies, a Centre for Information Technology and Systems, and a Consultancy Centre. \\n\\nThe UoM has undergone rapid expansion over the last decade and is continuing to expand with a student growth rate of about 10% annually. Programmes have changed steadily from sub-degree certificate/diploma levels to undergraduate and taught masters Programmes, as well as research at postgraduate level.\\n\\nThe University of Technology, Mauritius (UTM) Act was promulgated in May 2000 and became operational in September 2000. The UTM works closely with government, business and industry and operates from 3 Schools, namely, the School of Business Informatics and Software Engineering, the School of Public Sector Policy and Management, and the School of Sustainable Development Science.\\n\\nThe Open University of Mauritius, which is in the process of being set up with the reconfiguration of the Mauritius College of the Air, will provide opportunities for higher education through distance and open learning, serving students in Mauritius and in the region.\\n\\nFounded in 1973, the MIE was initially charged with responsibilities in the field of teacher education, research in education and curriculum development. The role of the MIE as a curriculum development centre has over time (1993) been phased out such that it is at present predominantly involved in training teachers and educational research. \\n\\nThere are currently 5 Schools at the MIE, namely Applied Sciences, Education, Science and Mathematics, Arts and Humanities and Distance Education. The programmes have over the years slowly increased in diversity and levels. To-date, it has offered training to school teachers in programme ranging from certificate, diploma and the PGCE. Presently, it also offers B.Ed as well as Masters programmes in Education, in collaboration with the University of Mauritius, the University of Technology and the University of Brighton, UK respectively.\\n\\nThe MGI was established in 1970 as a joint Government of Mauritius – Government of India venture for the promotion of education and culture in general with emphasis on Indian culture and traditions. It has responsibilities, within the tertiary set-up, for running Programmes in such areas as Indian Studies, Performing Arts, Fine Arts, Chinese and Mauritian Studies. \\n\\nThe MGI currently has three main schools operating at the tertiary level, namely the School of Indian Studies, the School of Music and Fine Arts, and the School of Mauritian and Area Studies. Since the last few years it has been running, besides diploma and certificate level programmes, degree level programmes in Languages, Fine Arts and Performing Arts, in collaboration with the UoM. A Secondary School and the Gandhian Basic School also operate within the ambit of the MGI.\\n\\nThe MCA was established in 1971 to promote education, arts and science and culture in Mauritius through mass media. When the MCA statute was re-enacted in 1985, distance education was maintained as a major strategy to meet these objectives. Merged with the Audio-Visual Centre of the Ministry of Education and Science in 1986, the MCA has until recently been catering mainly for the primary and secondary education sector through the production of educational programmes for broadcast on radio and television. The MCA has also been producing educational materials for non-formal or continuing education, for non-broadcast use. Since the beginning of 1995, it has been involved in dispensing tertiary level programmes in collaboration with overseas institutions through the distance mode.The MCA is currently being reconfigured as the Open University of Mauritius.\\n\\nThe Polytechnics occupy a prominent place in the tertiary education landscape in Mauritius. Two of these institutions currently exist in the country. The Swami Dayanand Institute of Management (SDIM) runs diploma level Programmes in Information Technology, Administration and Accounting; such diploma Programmes were formerly provided by the UoM. The Institut Supérieur de Téchnologie (IST) offers diploma level programmes (Brevét de Téchnicien Supérieur) in Electro-Technics, Mecatronics and Building Engineering. All the Programmes are run on a full-time basis. Plans are currently underway to expand this sub-sector and the creation of Institut de Formation et d'Education Tertiaire in priority areas.\\n\\nThe TSMTF was created in 1990 to manage the Polytechnics. It is administered by a Board. Industry Advisory Committees, with representatives of both the public and private sectors, are appointed in respect of each programme that is being run. These committees have responsibilities for: establishing programme objectives, curriculum content and delivery modes; establishing terminal standards and certification; prescribing training equipment, hardware and software; prescribing training facilities and environment; advising on industrial training attachments; reviewing programme results and diploma holders’ employment performance; monitoring and reviewing market demand; and reviewing and upgrading programmes.With the setting up of Institut de Formation et d'Education the role of the TSMTF may be reviewed.\\n\\nThe IVTB was set up in 1988 to promote vocational education and training with the purposes of supplying a properly trained workforce for the industrial, services and domestic sectors. Most of the programmes that are being run are of a vocational nature leading to the National Trade Certification (levels 3 and 2). However, as from 1998 the IVTB has also started running selected tertiary level programmes at the levels of certificate and diploma in selected areas including Hotel Management, Automation and Information Technology.\\n\\nThe MIH was set up in 1989 to cater for the training needs of health professionals, local and regional. As per identified needs it organizes courses and programmes, mostly of short duration for medical and para-medical personnel.\\n\\nA number of private institutions and organisations have entered the tertiary education market in the past few years. These institutions, which amount to more than 35, are offering mostly \"niche\" Programmes in such disciplines as Management, Accountancy and Information Technology. Most of these private institutions are local counterparts of overseas institutions and are offering programmes ranging from sub-degree to postgraduate ones through a mixed-mode system, encompassing both distance learning and face-to face tutorials. A majority of the examinations are conducted by the Mauritius Examinations Syndicate (MES) and a few are organised and invigilated by the overseas institutions themselves in collaboration with the local partner. Key players include the Charles Telfair Institute (ex DCDM Business School), MALEM, the Mauritius Employers Federation and the Mauritius Chamber of Commerce & Industry.\\n\\nPreviously known as the DCDM Business School, the Charles Telfair Institute is a private sector academic institution situated in Mauritius. It has as its shareholders this country's major private sector players - namely CIEL Corporate Services Ltd, DCDM & Co Ltd, Harel Frères Ltd and Rogers & Co. Ltd amongst others.\\n\\nThe institute works in collaboration with the Curtin University of Technology and Challenger TAFE.\\n\\nA purpose-built campus is in the process of being constructed at Telfair, Moka with completion projected for 2009. \\n\\nWith the financial and strategic support of its shareholders, the Charles Telfair Institute aims to support the Mauritian Government in its strategy of transforming the country into a regional knowledge hub.\\n\\nThe UIO, established in January 1998 under the aegis of the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), is essentially a network of tertiary education and research institutions of the five member states, namely Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Seychelles. It offers tertiary level programmes of a regional vocation in the five member countries. During its three-year pilot phase, the secretariat of the UIO was based in Reunion. In line with a recent decision, the seat of the UIO will now be a rotating one among member states.\\n\\nThe IFE came into operation in 1999, within the context of an agreement signed between the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research and the \"Association des Universités Partiellement ou Entièrement de Langue Française et L’Université des Réseaux d'Expréssion Française\". It offers Masters and Doctoral programmes and undertake research in entrepreneuriat and related fields with a regional vocation.\\n\\nThe SSRMC was created in 1999 and is affiliated to the University of Mauritius. Situated at Belle Rive, it caters for both local and overseas students namely from South Africa, India, Malaysia, Gulf and other Indian Ocean Rim countries. With this development, Mauritian students now have opportunities to pursue their medical studies locally and at much lower cost than they would incur elsewhere. In fact, 20% of seats are exclusively reserved for them on the 5-year MBBS programme.\\n\\nMauras College of Dentistry which is managed by the R.F. Gandhi A.K. Trust Limited, is operational since 2003. Affiliated to Bhavnagar University, Gujarat, India, Mauras College of Dentistry, aims to be a key provider of dental education in the region. It is currently providing the BDS programme. The Mauras College Of Dentistry found in the District of Pamplemouses, Aresenal.\\n\\nBIT Project International Ltd.

{"title": "Educational goals of Sesame Street", "body": "The children's television show Sesame Street, which premiered on public broadcasting television stations in 1969, was the first show of its kind that utilized a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, with specific educational goals, in its content. Its goals were garnered from formative and summative research, and its first curriculum was created in a series of five seminars in 1968.\\n\\nSesame Street has both cognitive and affective goals. Initially, its producers and researchers focused on cognitive goals, while addressing affective goals indirectly, because they believed that focusing on cognitive goals would increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. One of their initial and primary goals was preparing young children for school, especially children from low-income families. The show's producers used modeling, repetition, and humor to fulfill their goals. They made changes in the show's contents to increase their viewers' attention and to increase its appeal. They encouraged \"co-viewing\" to entice older children and parents to watch the show by including humor, cultural references, and celebrities.\\n\\nAfter Sesame Street's first season, its critics forced its producers and researchers to address affective goals more overtly. The affective goals they addressed were social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict, which was depicted through interpersonal disputes among its residents. In the 1980s, the show used the real-life experiences of the show's cast and crew, such as the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.\\n\\nThe show's goals for outreach were addressed through a series of programs that first focused on promotion, and then after the first season, on the development of educational materials used in preschool settings. Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.\\n\\nAs author Malcolm Gladwell has stated, \"Sesame Street was built around a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them\". Gerald S. Lesser, the first chair of the Children's Television Workshop's advisory board, stated that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention. Sesame Street was the first children's show that structured each episode and made, as Gladwell put it, \"small but critical adjustments\" to each segment to capture children's attention.\\n\\nAccording to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, Sesame Street was one of the few children's television programs that utilized a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, with specific educational goals, in its content. The show's goals were garnered from formative and summative research. The first curriculum was created in a series of five seminars, led by Lesser and attended by Sesame Street's new creative staff and by educational and child development specialists, in 1968. The seminars' participants generated long lists of goals, which the Workshop organized into five categories. Eventually, these categories were whittled down to four: symbolic representation, cognitive processes, the physical environment, and the social environment.#tag:ref At first, the goals were stated from the child's perspective, but eventually they were restated to reflect the writers' perspective.\\n\\nLesser reported in his 1974 book, Children and Television: Lessons Learned From Sesame Street, written to document the development of the show and the CTW, that one of the goals of the show's creators was \"the fundamental purpose of preparing children for school\". They were aware, as Lesser stated, of the \"individual suffering and frustration\" of the child who was ill-prepared for the demands of school, so they sought to instill in their young viewers an appetite for learning. Two related goals were providing their viewers with basic educational skills, which Lesser insisted was valuable to inner-city parents, and teaching children both what and how to think. The show's creators decided to only include in their curriculum the range of skills of the three-to-five year old child, and not focus on skills they already had, or on skills beyond their reach.\\n\\nAs Lesser stated, Sesame Street's creators recognized that television lent itself well to the use of modelling as a teaching tool. They understood that children tended to imitate what they saw on the screen, so many writing and production methods were used to directly model effective verbal communication. Indirect modeling, without explicit labeling, was used to demonstrate positive behaviors as well. One of the positive behaviors they modeled was inquisitiveness and the enjoyment of learning. If humor, for example, interfered with the intended instructional message or exhibited inappropriate behavior, it was removed. As Muppet performer Fran Brill explained, the show's puppeteers demonstrated emotions by banging their puppets' heads against the wall or by having them fall backwards, but when research found that these behaviors did not demonstrate good models of appropriate behavior, these behaviors were changed. The Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, for example, was removed from the show because many leaders in the African American community felt that he displayed negative cultural stereotypes.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe creators of Sesame Street believed that young children were easily distracted by peripheral details and were unable to selectively attend to the most useful aspects of what they observed, so they gave special care to, as Lesser put it, \"make salient what the child is expected to learn\". They eliminated irrelevant and distracting content without making the content uninteresting, especially in repeated viewings. The content they presented had to compete with the distractions that occurred as a result of viewing at home, so they realized that the show had to have high appeal. They found, however, that the relationship between appeal and comprehension was more complicated than they initially thought, and discovered that young children probably did not attend to material that was presented at a higher level than they were ready to understand. The workshop's researchers found that by crafting the show's segments, children's verbal participation and interaction could be increased, which addressed their critics' concerns about children's passivity while watching television.\\n\\nRepetition was a convention used often on Sesame Street. The creators understood that repetition gave young children opportunities to practice new skills and assisted them in making a connection between new and unfamiliar concepts. As Lesser stated, they observed that children seemed to enjoy some material more after viewing them several times, and allowed them to predict and anticipate the outcome of a sequence. Repetition made it easier to teach complex concepts or situations a child would not be able to comprehend from a single viewing, and allowed children to explore different facets of a subject. In the early years of Sesame Street, the producers took advantage of repetition as an effective teaching tool by often repeating the same segment many times during the course of an episode; in the first ten seasons, one in six segments was a repeat of an earlier one. The workshop also learned that varying the details while repeating the same format was also an effective use of repetition.\\n\\nTelevision historian Robert W. Morrow saw what he called \"the often repeated alphabet recitation segment\" as an example of the show's use of repetition. For example, in a short film in which actor James Earl Jones recited the alphabet, Jones made long pauses before each letter, which were superimposed in a corner of the screen moments before he said it. According to Cooney, some educational advisors recommended against using Jones, thinking that he would frighten young viewers, but children ended up loving his segments. The producers found that children who had seen the segment a few times said the letter before Jones did, and Jones often served as confirmation or correction. The producers viewed this as a way to make television more interactive, and dubbed it \"the James Earl Jones effect\".\\n\\nHumor was used on Sesame Street to both attract the attention of its young viewers and to, as Lesser put it, \"entice parents and older siblings to share the young child's viewing\", called \"coviewing\" by Truglio and Fisch. Lesser went so far as to state that educational television was \"completely dependent upon the effective use of humor\". Lesser also stated that in order for comedy to be an effective teaching tool, it had to coincide with the lesson being taught. Although critics complained that slapstick was too violent for children's television, the Workshop found that it was the most effective comedy form they used, and as Lesser said, \"a favorite with preschoolers\". Morrow reported that the only violence depicted on Sesame Street was \"slapstick punctuation\", and that it was used only in animations and short films.\\n\\nAnother way the Workshop encouraged co-viewing was through the use of cultural references that only adults would understand. According to Davis, Jim Henson was instrumental in creating the show's \"two-tiered audience\". Celebrities familiar to adults and older children also appeared on the show. According to writer Louise A. Gikow, Cooney's previous documentary production experience and producer Dave Connell's \"wide ranging contacts in the media\" resulted in successful bookings of celebrities on the show, even before the show became successful. As of 2009, over 500 celebrities had appeared on Sesame Street.\\n\\nAt first, the creators of Sesame Street addressed what Morrow called \"affective goals\" indirectly, believing that focusing on cognitive and educational goals would naturally increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. Their viewers' racial identities were addressed by integrating the show with, at first, black and white actors and performers. Eventually their critics during the show's first season forced the Workshop to address affective goals more overtly, which occurred after what Morrow called \"extensive research and planning\". The affective goals they addressed were social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict, which was depicted through interpersonal disputes among its residents, making Sesame Street, as Morrow put it, an \"idealized place of child empowerment\".\\n\\nAccording to Davis, Sesame Street's curriculum began addressing affective goals more overtly during the 1980s, when as he put it, the show focused on \"turning inward, expanding its young viewers' world\". Davis reported that their affective goals were inspired by the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew. For example, in one of the show's landmarks, the producers addressed grief after the 1982 death of Will Lee, who had played Mr. Hooper since the show's premiere.\\n\\nFor the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the topics of love, marriage, and childbirth were addressed when they created a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love, marry, and have a child, Gabi. Sonia Manzano, the actress who played Maria, had married and become pregnant; according to the book Sesame Street Unpaved, published after the show's thirtieth anniversary in 1999, Manzano's real-life experiences gave the show's writers and producers the idea. Research was done before any scripts were written to gain an understanding of the previous studies about preschoolers' understanding of love, marriage, and family. The show's research staff found that at the time, there was very little relevant research done about children's understanding of these topics, and no books for children had been written about them. Studies done after the episodes about Maria's pregnancy aired showed that as a result of watching these episodes, children's understanding of pregnancy increased.\\n\\nAccording to Gikow, another way Sesame Street addressed affective goals was by addressing real-life disasters. For example, the producers addressed the September 11 terrorist attacks with an episode that aired in early 2002. They also produced a series of four episodes that aired after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. These episodes were used in Sesame Workshop's Community Outreach program.\\n\\nGikow called writer Emily Perl Kingsley an \"expert\" at interpreting the show's curriculum goals surrounding tolerance, diversity, and inclusion, especially as it related to the disability community. Kingsley has been a leader in the Workshop for ensuring that people with disabilities were included in the show. For example, she hired the Little Theater of the Deaf to appear on Sesame Street, and was instrumental in the addition of Deaf actress Linda Bove to its cast. Kingsley's son Jason, who had Down's Syndrome, also appeared several times on the show. As Kingsley reported, \"...Sesame Street has a better record than any other show in the history of television of doing this on a regular basis in a comfortable kind of way\".\\n\\nAs Lesser reported, Sesame Street focused on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but the show's creators recognized that in order to achieve the kind of success they wanted, they needed to encourage all children, no matter what their background, to watch it. At the same time, however, their primary goal was to make the show appealing to inner-city families, a group that did not traditionally watch educational programs on public television. As Lesser stated, \"If the series did not work for poor children, the entire project would fail\". Morrow called the new show's audience \"concentric\", with its targeted audience, \"the urban poor\", within the larger circle of all preschoolers. As a result, the Workshop organized an outreach to inner-city communities, which as Lesser stated, \"would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research\".\\n\\nThe Workshop devoted 8% of their initial budget to advertise the new show. In what Morrow called \"an extensive campaign\", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. To get the word out to their target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called \"remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable\", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.\\n\\nAfter Sesame Street's popularity became established after its first season, the CES' outreach efforts turned from promotion to the development of educational materials used in preschool settings. As Yotive and Fisch reported, the child-care community eventually became the CES' \"core constituency\". Early outreach efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. In the early 1980s, the CES developed into the Sesame Street Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the show as an educational resource.\\n\\nThe Workshop's outreach programs included providing materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Instead of following the traditional practice of translating their English materials into Spanish, for example, they employed what they called \"versioning\", or creating parallel sets of materials that conveyed the same content and messages in culturally and linguistically relevant ways. Starting in 2006, the Workshop expanded its outreach by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs focusing on how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. The Workshop's outreach efforts also focused on families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.\\n\\n"}

On 4 Aug. 1803, Boys, when in charge of a prize, was made prisoner by the French, and continued so for six years, when after many daring and ingenious attempts he succeeded in effecting his escape. On his return to England he was made lieutenant, and served mostly in the West Indies till the peace. On 8 July 1814 he became commander; but, consequent on the reduction of the navy from its war strength, had no further employment afloat, though from 1837 to 1841 he was superintendent of the dockyard at Deal. On 1 July 1851 he retired with the rank of captain, and died in London on 6 July 1866. Immediately after his escape, and whilst in the West Indies, he wrote for his family an account of his adventures in France; the risk of getting some of his French friends into trouble had, however, made him keep this account private, and though abstracts from it had found their way into the papers it was not till 1827 that he was persuaded to publish it, under the title of Narrative of a Captivity and Adventures in France and Flanders between the years 1803-9, post 8vo. It is a book of surpassing interest, and the source from which the author of Peter Simple drew much of his account of that hero's escape, more perhaps than from the previously published narrative of Henry Ashworth's adventures. Captain Boys also published in 1831 Remarks on the Practicability and Advantages of a Sandwich or Downs Harbour. One of his sons, the present (1886) Admiral Henry Boys, was captain of the Excellent and superintendent of the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth 1869-74, director of naval ordnance from 1874-8, and second in command of the Channel fleet in 1878-9.\\n\\n"}

Eisenhower were natives of Abilene, Kansas who sparked a friendship that would last from their meeting in high school until Hazlett’s death from cancer in 1958. From the beginning of their freshman year in Abilene High School (Abilene, Kansas), Eisenhower felt protective of Hazlett and quickly bestowed the nickname \"Swede\" on him. According to Eisenhower, \"He [Hazlett] was a big fellow...but he was raised in a quiet atmosphere and occasionally a few people smaller than he would try to bulldoze him...I felt protective, a sort of obligation to him, and I took it upon myself to tell a few of the so-and-so's to lay off.\" \\n\\nIn his book At Ease: Stories I Tell to Friends, Eisenhower writes that Hazlett persuaded him to apply for an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. According to Eisenhower, \"It was not difficult to persuade me that this was a good move...I realized that my own college education would not be achieved without considerable delay while I tried to accumulate money. With Ed [ Edgar N. Eisenhower ] already in college and receiving some help from Father and with Earl [ Earl D. Eisenhower ] and Milton [ Milton Stover Eisenhower ] coming on in the future, I could see that if I could made it [sic], I would take a burden off my family.\"  Both Hazlett and Eisenhower passed the entrance examination but Eisenhower was barred from entrance because he exceeded the maximum allowable entance age. With that, Hazlett attended the Naval Academy and Eisenhower accepted an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. \\n\\nWhile Eisenhower's career blossomed with preparations to enter the Second World War, ill health (which would plague him the rest of his life) brought on by a heart attack ended Hazlett’s active military career in 1939. He would later return to duty during the Second World War first as an instructor at the Naval Academy and then as the commander of the naval training program at the University of North Carolina before finally retiring in 1946. \\n\\nDuring his presidency, Eisenhower would frequently write personal and revealing letters to Hazlett even during his most busy periods. Usually never one to openly share his feelings, Eisenhower would pour his thoughts and concerns into these letters. The letters addressed his thoughts on topics as diverse as, \"Vietnam, the Middle East, civil rights, defense spending, [and] the problem of who would succeed him as president.\" Thus, Eisenhower's letters to Hazlett serve as a window into his thoughts on his own presidency.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby", "body": "Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby KG, PC, FRS (21 July 1826 – 21 April 1893), known as Lord Stanley from 1844 to 1869, was a British statesman. He served as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs twice, from 1866 to 1868 and from 1874 to 1878.\\n\\nHe was born to Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby and Emma Caroline Bootle-Wilbraham, daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Baron Skelmersdale, and was the older brother of Frederick Arthur Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby. The Stanleys were one of the richest landowning families in England. Lord Stanley, as he was styled before acceding to the earldom, was educated at Eton, Rugby and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a first in classics and became a member of the society known as the Cambridge Apostles.\\n\\nIn March 1848 he unsuccessfully contested the borough of Lancaster, and then made a long tour in the West Indies, Canada and the United States. During his absence he was elected member for King's Lynn, which he represented till October 1869, when he succeeded to the peerage. He took his place, as a matter of course, among the Conservatives, and delivered his maiden speech in May 1850 on the sugar duties. Just before, he had made a very brief tour in Jamaica and South America. In 1852 he went to India, and while travelling in that country he was appointed under-secretary for foreign affairs in his father's first administration.\\n\\nFrom the outset of his career he was known to be more politically sympathetic to the Liberal rather than the Conservatives, and in 1855 Lord Palmerston offered him the post of Secretary of State for the Colonies. He was much tempted by the proposal, and hurried down to Knowsley to consult his father, who called out when he entered the room, \"Halo, Stanley! what brings you here? — Has Dizzy cut his throat, or are you going to be married?\" When the object of his sudden appearance had been explained, the Conservative chief received the courteous suggestion of the prime minister with anything but favour, and the offer was declined. In his father's second administration Lord Stanley held, at first, the office of Secretary of State for the Colonies (1858), but became President of the Board of Control on the resignation of Lord Ellenborough. He had the charge of the India Bill of 1858 in the House of Commons, became the first Secretary of State for India, and left behind him in the India Office an excellent reputation as a man of business.\\n\\nAfter the revolution in Greece and the disappearance of King Otto, the people most earnestly desired to have Queen Victoria's second son, Prince Alfred, for their king. He declined the honour, and they then took up the idea that the next best thing they could do would be to elect some great and wealthy English noble, not concealing the hope that although they might have to offer him a Civil List he would decline to receive it. Lord Stanley was the prime favourite as an occupant of this bed of thorns, and it has been said that he was actually offered the crown. That, however, is not true; the offer was never formally made.\\n\\nAfter the fall of the Russell government in 1866 he became Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his father's third administration. He compared his conduct in that great post to that of a man floating down a river and fending off from his vessel, as well as he could, the various obstacles it encountered. He thought that that should be the normal attitude of an English foreign minister, and probably in the circumstances of the years 1866-1868 it was the right one. He arranged the collective guarantee of the neutrality of Luxembourg in 1867, negotiated a convention about the Alabama, which, however, was not ratified, and most wisely refused to take any part in the Cretan troubles. In 1874 he again became Foreign Secretary in Disraeli's government. He acquiesced in the purchase of the Suez Canal shares, a measure then considered dangerous by many people, but ultimately most successful; he accepted the Andrassy Note, but declined to accede to the Berlin Memorandum. His part in the later phases of the Russo-Turkish struggle has never been fully explained, for with equal wisdom and generosity he declined to gratify public curiosity at the cost of some of his colleagues. A later generation will know better than his contemporaries what were the precise developments of policy which obliged him to resign. He kept himself ready to explain in the House of Lords the course he had taken if those whom he had left challenged him to do so, but from that course they consistently refrained. \\n\\nBy October 1879 it was clear enough that he had thrown in his lot with the Liberal Party, but it was not till March 1880 that he publicly announced this change of allegiance. He did not at first take office in the second Gladstone government, but became Colonial Secretary in December 1882, holding this position till the fall of that government in the summer of 1885. In 1886 the old Liberal party was run on the rocks and went to pieces. Lord Derby became a Liberal Unionist, and took an active part in the general management of that party, leading it in the House of Lords till 1891, when Lord Hartington became Duke of Devonshire. In 1892 he presided over the Labour Commission.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nHe served as President of the first day of the 1881 Co-operative Congress.\\n\\nLord Derby married Lady Mary, daughter of George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr and widow of James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury, in 1870. They had no children. Derby's health never recovered an attack of influenza which he had in 1891, and he died at Knowsley on 21 April 1893, aged 66. He was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother, Frederick. Lady Derby died in December 1900. pals.\\n\\nEdward\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edward Thorndike", "body": "Edward Lee Thorndike (August 31, 1874 – August 9, 1949) was an American psychologist who spent nearly his entire career at Teachers College, Columbia University. His work on animal behavior and the learning process led to the theory of connectionism and helped lay the scientific foundation for modern educational psychology. He also worked on solving industrial problems, such as employee exams and testing. He was a member of the board of the Psychological Corporation, and served as president of the American Psychological Association in 1912.\\n\\nThorndike, born in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, was the son of a Methodist minister in Lowell, Massachusetts.\\n\\nOn August 29, 1900, he wed Elizabeth Moulton and they had five children.\\n\\nThorndike graduated from The Roxbury Latin School (1891), in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, Wesleyan University (B.S. 1895), Harvard University (M.A. 1897), and Columbia University (PhD. 1898). \\n\\nEdward Thorndike became an American pioneer in Comparative Psychology. He was also a well respected colleague at Columbia University, where he taught alongside fellow staff.\\n\\nUpon graduation, Thorndike returned to his initial interest, Educational Psychology. In 1898 he completed his PhD at Columbia University under the supervision of James McKeen Cattell, one of the founding fathers of psychometrics. In 1899, after a year of unhappy, initial employment at the College for Women of Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, he became an instructor in psychology at Teachers College at Columbia University, where he remained for the rest of his career, studying human learning, education, and mental testing. In 1937 Thorndike became the second President of the Psychometric Society, following in the footsteps of Louis Leon Thurstone who had established the society and its journal Psychometrika the previous year.\\n\\nAmong Thorndike's most notable contributions involved his research on how cats learned to escape from puzzle boxes and his related formulation of the law of effect. The law of effect states that responses that are closely followed by satisfying consequences become associated with the situation, and are more likely to recur when the situation is subsequently encountered. If the responses are followed by aversive consequences, associations to the situation become weaker. The puzzle box experiments were motivated in part by Thorndike's dislike for statements that animals made use of extraordinary faculties such as insight in their problem solving: \"In the first place, most of the books do not give us a psychology, but rather a eulogy of animals. They have all been about animal intelligence, never about animal stupidity.\"\\n\\nThorndike meant to distinguish clearly whether or not cats escaping from puzzle boxes were using insight. Thorndike's instruments in answering this question were learning curve revealed by plotting the time it took for an animal to escape the box each time it was in the box. He reasoned that if the animals were showing insight, then their time to escape would suddenly drop to a negligible period, which would also be shown in the learning curve as an abrupt drop; while animals using a more ordinary method of trial and error would show gradual curves. His finding was that cats consistently showed gradual learning. \\n\\nThorndike interpreted the findings in terms of associations. He asserted that the connection between the box and the motions the cat used to escape was strengthened by each escape. A similar, though radically reworked idea was taken up by B. F. Skinner in his formulation of operant conditioning. The associative analysis went on to figure largely in behavioral work through mid-century, and is now evident in some modern work in behavior. Thorndike supported Dewey's functionalism and added a stimulus-response component and renamed it connectionist. His theory became an educational requirement for the next fifty years. \\n\\nThorndike specified three conditions that maximizes learning: \\n\\nThorndike also studied auxiliary language and influenced the work of the International Auxiliary Language Association, which developed Interlingua.\\n\\nThorndike put his testing expertise to work for the United States Army during World War I. He created both the Alpha and Beta tests ancestors to today's ASVAB, a multiple choice test, administered by the United States Military Entrance Processing Command, used to determine qualification for enlistment in the United States armed forces. For classification purposes, soldiers were administered Alpha tests. With the realization that some soldiers could not read well enough to complete the Alpha test, the Beta test (consisting of pictures and diagrams) was administered. Such contributions anchored the field of psychology and encouraged later development of educational psychology.\\n\\nThorndike believed that “Instruction should pursue specified, socially useful goals.” Thorndike studied “Adult Learning”, and believed that the ability to learn did not decline until age 35, and only then at a rate of 1 percent per year, going against the thoughts of the time that \"you can't teach old dogs new trick.\" It was later shown  that the speed of learning, not the power of learning declined with age. Thorndike also stated the law of effect, which says behaviors that are followed by good consequences are likely to be repeated in the future.\\n\\nThorndike was one of the first pioneers of active learning, a theory that proposes letting children learn themselves, rather than receiving instruction from teachers.\\n\\nThorndike composed three different word books to assist teachers with word and reading instruction. After publication of the first book in the series, The Teacher's Word Book (1921), two other books were written and published, each approximately a decade apart from its predecessor. The second book in the series, its full title being A Teacher's Word Book of the Twenty Thousand Words Found Most Frequently and Widely in General Reading for Children and Young People, was published in 1932, and the third and final book, The Teacher's Word Book of 30,000 Words, was published in 1944.\\n\\nIn the preface to the third book, Thorndike writes that the list contained therein “tells anyone who wishes to know whether to use a word in writing, speaking, or teaching how common the word is in standard English reading matter” (p. x), and he further advises that the list can best be employed by teachers if they allow it to guide the decisions they make choosing which words to emphasize during reading instruction. Some words require more emphasis than others, and, according to Thorndike, his list informs teachers of the most frequently occurring words that should be reinforced by instruction and thus become “a permanent part of [students’] stock of word knowledge” (p. xi). If a word is not on the list but appears in an educational text, its meaning only needs to be understood temporarily in the context in which it was found, and then summarily discarded from memory.\\n\\nIn Appendix A to the second book, Thorndike gives credit to his word counts and how frequencies were assigned to particular words. Selected sources extrapolated from Appendix A are:\\n\\nThorndike also examined local newspapers and correspondences for common words to be included in the book.\\n\\n"}

At the time of the game he was still a student at Cowbridge, and later became a medical student at St Bartholomew's Hospital.\\n\\nWhen Richard Mullock formed the first Welsh rugby union team in 1881, Treharne was one of the youngest members contacted to join the side. At the time he was living in Pontypridd, and is reported to have played for the club from 1880; but Treharne was still studying for Cowbridge Grammar School when the Welsh game took place. The match against England was a one-sided affair, with Wales losing by a massive seven goals, a drop goal and six tries to nil.

He studied at Harvard College, graduating in 1765 with an MA. After graduation, as the political tension escalated between Great Britain and its North American colonies over issues such as trade, taxation, and governance, Winslow publicly put his support behind Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson and helped create \"a company of Tories\" in an effort to keep the peace. By 1774, Winslow was forced to flee Plymouth, and in April 1775, as a member of the British Army, he was involved in a bloody confrontation at Lexington against the Patriot militia. In March 1776, he retreated along with the British troops to Halifax, and by July had been appointed muster master general for the Loyalist forces. It was during the war that Winslow met his future wife Mary Symonds, and by 1783 they had three children: Daniel Murray (1777-1814), Chipman(1778-1783) and Mary (1779-1843). Nine children would eventually follow: Penelope (1783-1836), John Frances Wentworth (1783-1859), Thomas Aston Coffin (1784-1810), Edward (1785?-1820), Hannah (b.1788?), Sarah Ann (1790-?), Christianna (1791-1814), Eliza Chipman (1794-1854), and Catherine (1799-1805). \\n\\nAfter the Patriots' victory was secured in 1783, Winslow and his fellow Loyalists were essentially reduced to the status of refugees. He moved his family to Granville in Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, but spent most of his time in Halifax making plans for the settling of Loyalists throughout Nova Scotia. Frustrated with the efforts of the Nova Scotia authorities at settling the approximately 35,000 Loyalists, Winslow began to advocate for the creation of a separate colony in the area north of the Bay of Fundy. In 1783 he was named secretary to Brigadier-General Henry Edward Fox, who was sympathetic to Winslow's proposal. The British government approved the creation of a new colony, called New Brunswick, in June 1784.\\n\\nWinslow and his family spent a few months in Saint John, New Brunswick, in 1785, before moving to Fredericton.

He was educated at Bishop Hale's School (now Hale School) in Perth, then at 15 worked at Bowes sheep station at Northampton from the age of 15. In 1874, he took up sheep farming with his brother Frank at Yuin in the Murchison district, before returning to Bowes in 1877 to lease and manage it. On 23 April 1878 he married Laura Habgood; they would have two sons and three daughters.\\n\\nIn 1881, Wittenoom purchased the Geraldton station White Peak from John Drummond, and established a sheep stud farm there. From 1883 to 1886 he also owned a station at La Grange. He ran a stock and station agency in Geraldton in 1886 and 1887, but later sold it. He became heavily involved in business and finance, becoming managing director for Dalgety &amp; Co. in 1901; chairman of directors of Millars Karri and Jarrah Co.; chairman of Bovril Australian Estates; director of the Bank of New South Wales; director of Commercial Union Insurance; and director of the WA Bank.

{"title": "Efferocytosis", "body": "In cell biology, efferocytosis (from efferre, Latin for 'to take to the grave', 'to bury') is the process by which apoptotic cells (which have undergone programmed or regulated cell death) are removed by phagocytic cells (which 'ingest' the dead cell). It can be regarded as the 'burying of dead cells'.\\n\\nDuring efferocytosis, the cell membrane of phagocytic cells engulfs the apoptotic cell, forming a large fluid-filled vesicle containing the dead cell. This ingested vesicle is called an efferosome (in analogy to the term phagosome). This process is similar to macropinocytosis (phagocytosis of large membrane-surrounded vesicles). Both these processes are inhibited by amiloride.\\n\\nThe effect of efferocytosis is that dead cells are removed before their membrane integrity is breached and their contents leak into the surrounding tissue. This prevents exposure of tissue to toxic enzymes, oxidant and other intracellular components such as protease and caspase.\\n\\nEfferocytosis can be performed not only by 'professional' phagocytic cells such as macrophages or dendritic cell, but also by many other cell types including epithelial cell and fibroblast. To distinguish them from living cells, apoptotic cells carry specific 'eat me' signals, such as the presence of phosphatidyl serine (resulting from phospholipid flip-flop) or calreticulin on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane.\\n\\nEfferocytosis triggers specific downstream intracellular signal transduction pathways, for example resulting in anti-inflammatory, anti-protease and growth-promoting effects. Conversely, impaired efferocytosis has been linked to autoimmune disease and tissue damage. Efferocytosis results in production by the ingesting cell of mediators such as hepatocyte- and vascular endothelial growth factor, which are thought to promote replacement of the dead cells.\\n\\nDefective efferocytosis has been demonstrated in such diseases as cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, COPD, asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, glomerulonephritis and atherosclerosis.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Efforts to stem the Deepwater Horizon oil spill", "body": "Efforts to stem the Deepwater Horizon oil spill were ongoing from the time that the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20, 2010 until the refinery was sealed by a cap on July 15, 2010. However, it will most likely end with BP bringing relief wells into the area to permanently solve the problem. Various species of dolphin and other mammal (61 casualties), bird (2,095 casualties), and the endangered sea turtle (467 casualties) have been killed either directly or indirectly by the oil spill. The Deepwater Horizon spill has surpassed in volume the 1989 ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill as the largest ever to originate in U.S.-controlled waters; it is comparable to the 1979 Ixtoc I oil spill in total volume released (Ixtoc discharged 140 to 148 million gallons; as of mid-July 2010, Deepwater Horizon has spilled 90 million to 180 million gallons).\\n\\nMuch of the oil is so far down in the Gulf that only nature, including microbe, will be able to remove it using a process called bioremediation. Terry Hazen of the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said the process could take months or years. But after six weeks of research, he said that microbes could work quickly in  water as opposed to colder-temperature waters. The A Whale, which is an oil tanker converted into a giant oil skimmer owned by the Taiwan Marine Transport Co (TMT), could do little because the oil is so far down, the company said on July 16. Robert Bea of The University of California, who worked on the Ixtoc spill and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, said the old methods would be the best ones. Dispersants, he said, did not work except in keeping beaches clean, and they hurt the environment.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe first attempts to stop the oil spill were to use remotely operated underwater vehicles to close the blowout preventer valves on the well head; however, all these attempts failed. The second technique, placing a  containment dome (which had worked on leaks in shallower water) over the largest leak and piping the oil to a storage vessel on the surface, failed when gas leaking from the pipe combined with cold water formed methane hydrate crystals that blocked the opening at the top of the dome.\\n\\nOn May 14, engineers began the process of positioning a  wide riser insertion tube into the  wide burst pipe. There was a stopper-like washer around the tube that plugs the end of the riser and diverts the flow into the insertion tube. The collected gas was flared and oil stored on the board of drillship Discoverer Enterprise.  of oil was collected before removal of the tube.\\n\\nOn May 26, BP tried to close the well using a technique called \"top kill\", which also failed. This process involved pumping heavy drilling fluid through two  lines into the blowout preventer to restrict the flow of oil before sealing it permanently with cement.\\n\\nthumbOn May 29, BP moved to the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) Cap Containment System by removing the damaged riser from the top of the blowout preventer and covering the pipe by the cap which connects it to a riser. The cap was attached on June 3, and the system began to capture the leaking oil. On June 6, the CEO of BP Tony Hayward, stated that the amount captured was \"probably the vast majority of the oil.\" However, the FRTG member Ira Leifer claimed that more oil was escaping than before the riser was cut and the cap containment system was placed.\\n\\nOn June 16, a second containment system connected directly to the blowout preventer became operational carrying oil and gas through a subsea manifold to the Q4000 service vessel with a processing capacity for about  of oil per day. Oil and gas are both burned on Q4000 in a clean-burning system.\\n\\nAs Discoverer Enterprise's processing capacity was insufficient, drillship Discoverer Clear Leader and the floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel Helix Producer 1 were added, offloading oil with tankers Evi Knutsen, and Juanita. Each tanker has a total capacity of . In addition, FPSO Seillean, and well testing vessel Toisa Pisces would process oil. They are offloaded by shuttle tanker Loch Rannoch.\\n\\nOn July 5, BP announced that its one-day oil recovery effort accounted for 24,980 barrels of oil, and the flaring off of 57.1 million cubic feet of natural gas. The total oil collection to date for the spill was estimated at 657,300 barrels. The government's estimates suggested the cap and other equipment were capturing less than half of the oil leaking from the sea floor as of late June.\\n\\nOn July 10, robot removed the containment cap to replace it with a better-fitting cap (\"Top Hat Number 10\"); this meant all of the leaking oil would escape until the new cap was in place. A broken pipe was taken out on July 11 and replaced with a flange spool resembling a pipe, on top of which the new cap was located. The well integrity test was scheduled to take place after the installation of a three-ram capping stack over the lower marine riser package of the Deepwater Horizon semi-submersible rig on . On July 14, BP announced that the test would be delayed under Allen's orders; oil continued to flow into the Gulf.\\n\\nOn July 15, 2010, BP announced that it had successfully plugged the oil leak using a tightly fitted cap. The cap, weighing 75 tons and standing  high, is now bolted to the failed blowout preventer. It consists of a Flange Transition Spool and a 3 Ram Stack and is a temporary solution.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama cautiously welcomed the news that the leak had been stopped, though stressing, \"it is important we don't get ahead of ourselves\". If the cap holds for the planned 48 hours, its valves will be reopened temporarily in order to allow for seismic tests to ensure that oil is not escaping into the bedrock. At the time of the stoppage, oil had been leaking continuously into the Gulf of Mexico for 85 days, 16 hours and 25 minutes since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on April 20, 2010.\\n\\nUntil July 19, 2010, there was no evidence that the well had ruptured, meaning that the cap appeared to be working. According to Thad Allen, the retired US Coast Guard admiral in charge of the operation to stop the leak, the cap will be used to channel the flowing oil to surface ships for collection after the 48-hour test period and will be used to shut the well down during bad weather rather than permanently cap the well, which is expected to happen in mid-August 2010, when relief wells have been completed. However, on July 19, 2010, seepage was detected from the seafloor within two kilometres of the well. Allen believes it probably has nothing to do with the well, as oil and gas are known to ooze naturally from fissures in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\nOn July 22, Adm. Thad Allen faced a difficult decision. Forecasts of the track of tropical storm Bonnie made it imperative that the support ships and rigs leave the site. The capping stack would thus be unsupervised for several days. The safe option would have been to open the valves and relieve pressure in the riser; however, that would obviously have the effect of turning back on the gush of oil and gas, with no option to either collect it or burn it off. Allen, in consultation with Energy Secretary Steven Chu, made the decision to leave the valves closed. Kent Wells, a senior vice president of BP, said “We have enough confidence to leave the well shut in.” Since the storm proved weaker than expected on July 24, the ships returned to finish off the job once and for all. Efforts to close the well on a permanent basis soon began.\\n\\nBP is drilling two relief well into the original well to enable them to block it. Once the relief wells reach the original borehole, the operator will pump drilling fluid into the original well. Transocean's Development Driller&nbsp;III started drilling a first relief well on May 2 and was at  out of  as of June 14. GSF Development Driller&nbsp;II started drilling a second relief on May 16 and was halted at  out of  as of June 14 while BP engineers verified the operational status of the second relief well's blowout preventer. The relief wells are expected to begin operating in August 2010 at a cost of about $100 million per well.\\n\\nDespite delays caused by Tropical Storm Bonnie, the first phase of stopping the leak was expected to start on July 30. Lining a relief shaft with steel casing was expected to resume on July 28, and a relief tunnel would take a week to drill but may be needed if phase one does not work.\\n\\nAdm. Thad Allen said on July 26 that the \"static kill\", using mud and cement poured into the top of the well, could start on August 2. The \"bottom kill\" would follow, with mud and cement entering the well under the sea floor, possibly by August 7.\\n\\nStarting at 15:00 CDT on August 3, first test oil and then drilling mud was pumped at a slow rate of approximately two barrels/minute into the well-head. Pumping continued for eight hours, at the end of which time the well was declared to be \"in a static condition.\"\\n\\nAt 09:15 CDT on August 4, with Adm. Allen's approval, BP began pumping cement from the top, sealing that part of the flow channel permanently.\\n\\nOn August 4, Allen said the static kill was working. Two weeks later, though, Allen said it was uncertain when the well could be declared completely sealed. The bottom kill had yet to take place, and the relief well had been delayed by storms. Even when the relief well was ready, he said, BP had to make sure pressure would not build up again.\\n\\nOn September 10, Allen said the bottom kill could start sooner than expected because a \"locking sleeve\" could be used on top of the well to prevent excessive pressure from causing problems. BP said the relief well was about 50 feet from the intersection, and finishing the boring would take four more days. On September 16, the relief well reached its destination and pumping of cement to seal the well began. Officials said on September 18 that the cement pumped in from the base of the well had completed the sealing of the well. On September 19, after pressure testing, Allen declared the well \"officially dead\".\\n\\nIn mid-May, United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu assembled a team of nuclear physicists, including hydrogen bomb designer Richard Garwin and Sandia National Laboratories director Tom Hunter. On May 24 BP ruled out conventional explosives, saying that if blasts failed to clog the well, \"We would have denied ourselves all other options.\"\\n\\nFederal officials also ruled out nuclear devices due to environmental and political risks, and because it would violate the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Admiral Thad Allen stated, \"since we don't know the condition of that well bore or the casings, I would be cautious about putting any kind of kinetic energy on that well head, because what you may do is create open communication between the reservoir and the sea floor.\" Allen also said that the result could be oil seeping through cracks and through the seafloor, \"and then be uncontrolled until the reservoir pressure equalized with the hydrostatic pressure; I think that's a risk that's too great to take a chance on, myself.\" Casing integrity concerns also influenced the pressure chosen for the top kill procedure.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Egeria (pilgrim)", "body": "Egeria or Aetheria (often called Sylvia) was a Gallaeci or Gallic woman who made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land about 381–384. She wrote an account of her journey in a long letter to a circle of women at home which survives in fragmentary form in a later copy. This may have been the first formal writing by a woman.  \\n\\nMuch of the surviving information about Egeria comes from a letter written by the 7th century Galician monk Valerio of Bierzo. He praises Egeria and identifies her as a nun, perhaps because she addresses her account to her \"sorores\" (Latin for \"sisters\") at home. However, others (including Hagith Sivan, 1988) have pointed out that during Egeria's time it was common to address fellow lay Christians as \"sisters\" and \"brothers.\" Valerio may also have believed her to be a nun because she went on such a pilgrimage, although lay women of the time are known to have engaged in such religious tourism. \\n\\nThose who suggest that Egeria was not a monastic claim that there is much to suggest that she was not a nun, including: her freedom to make such a long pilgrimage and to change plans as it suited her, the high cost of her pilgrimage, her level of education, and her subject matter which focused on the sights and not miracles like letters we have by monks at that time. Realistically, however, considering social constraints on women at the time, these points make it equally likely that she was a nun, since such social freedoms were not as available to middle-class women within their households, and such lone pilgrimages were rare among lay women at the time and miracles may well have been recorded in other parts of the texts. Ignored by those who argue that Egeria was a layperson is the fact that she spent over three years and was in no rush to return home, which would indicate that she was not middle-class, but either financially self-sufficient alone, or more possibly a monastic such as a gyrovague, or \"wandering monastic\" as described in the rule of St Benedict, who travels from monastery to monastery.\\n\\nEgeria wrote down her observations in a letter now called Itinerarium Egeriae, or the Travels of Egeria. It is sometimes also called Peregrinatio Aetheriae (the Pilgrimage of Aetheria) or Peregrinatio ad Loca Sancta (Pilgrimage to the Holy Lands) or some other combination. The middle part of Egeria's writing survived and was copied in the Codex Aretinus, which was written at Monte Cassino in the eleventh century, while the beginning and end are lost. This Codex Aretinus was discovered in 1884 by the Italian scholar Gian Francesco Gamurrini, who found the manuscript in a monastic library in Arezzo. Egeria describes the monks, many holy places and geographical points in her travels and even the early details of the liturgical practices of the church at Jerusalem.\\n\\nThe manuscript has been translated several times, but perhaps the most recommended translation for the average reader is John Wilkinson, Egeria's Travels: Newly Translated (1999), especially since it includes supporting documents and notes. Another translation of Egeria's writing for the average reader is the Gingras edition in the Ancient Christian Writers series.\\n\\nThe Itinerarium Egeriae has provided scholars with valuable information about developments in the grammar and vocabulary of Vulgar Latin. For example, expressions such as \"deductores sancti illi\" (\"those holy guides\" meaning \"the holy guides\") help to reveal the origins of the definite article now used in all the Romance languages (except Sardinian) - such as French (\"les saints guides\") or Italian (\"le sante guide\"). Similarly, the use of 'ipsam' in a phrase such as \"per mediam vallem ipsam\" (\"through [the] middle of [the] valley itself\") anticipates the type of definite article (\"péri sa mesanía de sa bàdhe\") that is found in Sardinian (\"sa limba sarda\") - at least in its standard form.\\n\\nEgeria's record of her travels to the Holy Land also provides a late 4th century account of liturgical worship in Palestine. The liturgical year was in its incipient stages at the time of her visit. This is invaluable because the development of liturgical worship (e.g. Lent, palm or passion Sunday) reached universal practice in the 4th century. Egeria provides a first hand account of practices and implementation of liturgical seasons as they existed at the time of her visit. This snapshot is before universal acceptance of a December 25 celebration of the nativity of Jesus; this is very early and very helpful in cataloging the development of annual liturgical worship. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Egg on Mao: The Story of an Ordinary Man Who Defaced an Icon and Unmasked a Dictatorship", "body": "Egg on Mao: The Story of an Ordinary Man Who Defaced an Icon and Unmasked a Dictatorship is the third book by Chinese Canadian author Denise Chong. Her first publication in over a decade, it was released by Random House Canada on September 29, 2009.\\n\\nAs the title reflects, Egg on Mao will pick up on both the genre (historical non-fiction) and the fascinations of both of Chong's earlier books: The Concubine's Children (1994) and The Girl in the Picture: The Kim Phuc Story (1999). The theme of exploring the ordinary in extraordinary circumstances is common to all three of these works. Chong describes her attraction to this theme thus: “Freed from a fear of limitation, the writer also frees the reader, so that what is ordinary is turned, by an act of imagination, into the extraordinary.” \\n\\nEgg on Mao tells the story of Lu Decheng, a bus mechanic, who challenged China's autocratic system by defacing a portrait of Chairman Mao during the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square.\\n\\nPublished in 2009 by Random House of Canada, Egg on Mao is categorized under current affairs, history, international, and China, not as a fictional book. This book has been criticized for its lack of commitment to a specific genre.\\n\\nThe story opens with three men – Lu Decheng, Yu Dongyue, and Yu Zhijian – who have just defaced Mao Zedong’s portrait in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Decheng, Dongyue, and Zhijian are three friends from Southern China who have traveled to Beijing to express their sentiment towards the Chinese Communist Party. The leading character, Decheng, is the activist on which this book is inspired upon. As the story unfolds, discontent and frustration are shown through Decheng’s life and the people surrounding him – from the education reforms of the Cultural Revolution to the Protest of 1989. Decheng’s friend, Zhijan, a fellow activist who took part in defacing the portrait, express the reasons why the three vandalized the portrait: “to motivate the student leadership to question the legitimacy of the Communist regime itself, and therefore its very authority to impose a state of martial law.” Throughout the book, Chong reveals events in Decheng’s life that lead up his decision – from his refusal to cry on cue with his classmates after Mao’s death to hearing about the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party from his grandmother. After the activists’ act of vandalism, the three are sentenced to prison. During his imprisonment, Decheng’s wife divorces him. Years later, upon his return to Liuyang, Hunan, he remarries. The story has alternating chapters, shifting through periods of Decheng’s life, from his time in prison to memories earlier in his adolescent years. The book ends with the moments leading up to the defacing of Mao’s portrait.\\n\\nUpon Lu Decheng’s release after serving nine years in prison, Chong was contacted by an editor at Random House Canada, who wanted her to commission a book on human rights in China. Seeing how changes in China have taken place so rapidly since 1989, Chong wanted to write about the issues of democracy and human rights, topics that are less prevalent today among China’s international trading partners. Speaking in an interview, she said: “In the unseemly rush of the West to do business there, [has] human rights lost its profile? There never is a more urgent narrative than human rights and democracy in China.” Chong saw the need to portray another aspect of Chinese society. “I saw a personal story about human rights, set in a state that bans dissent and protest, as a chance to understand the morality that is at the core of being human.” For Chong, Egg on Mao was written with the intention of helping Westerners to better understand the issue of democracy and human rights in China.\\n\\nChong left for China in May of 2007, to gather more information. Interviews with several residents of Liuyang and various people, including Yu Dongyue, were the bulk of her research. Other works from scholars, writers, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, and artists complemented her research. The difficulty of getting interviewers due to their fear of state persecution and interpreters to translate the conversations made secrecy a top priority. To ensure the safety of those who are connected to Dongyue’s story, Chong refuses to comment on the conversations and persons involved. She recognizes the imprecision and omissions of translation and takes full responsibility for any shortcomings. Chong recalls her experience of obtaining information while researching:\\n\\nThe cover of this book features a paint-splattered picture of Mao Zedong’s face with the caption: “the story of an ordinary man who defaced an icon and unmasked a dictatorship.” This has led some to believe Egg on Mao is an anti-China book. As Chong states, “What I heard most often was, ‘Is this a China-bashing book?.’” According to Chong, fear of offending Beijing – in the West – has led to some uncomfortable reactions. A pre-organized interview with a Chinese-language television station was cancelled; and a Canadian nonprofit economic development group which had sponsored a fund-raiser featuring Chong downplayed its association to her.A telephone interview with a library employee from the United States Library of Congress reveals this trepidation was shared in America. Allegedly, the unnamed employee acknowledged the Library of Congress’s refusal to hold an event with Chong because of the sensitivity of her book; another factor in the decision was the Library of Congress’s new relationship with the National Library of China.In Donna Bailey Nurse’s review of Egg on Mao, she criticizes the book’s descriptive language of Chinese aphorisms as awkward and flat, especially during dialogue between characters. Nurse calls Chong’s commitment to the various genres: biography, bildungsroman, political history, and roman as flaws in her book. However, she praises Chong’s intent and sincerity of writing Decheng’s story, stating that it does much to minimize the flaws. Nurse is a literary journalist and a lecturer, and often writes for Canadian newspapers as a book reviewer. She has written reviews for the Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star, and ''the Montreal Gazette''. In response to Nurse’s critique, Jim Munson, a Senator of Ottawa and a retired journalist, said:\\n\\nJim Munson spent five years in China as a reporter and witnessed the defacing of Mao Zedong’s portrait by Decheng and his peers.In The China Beat’s review of Egg on Mao, the various genres of this book are cited as having benefits and drawbacks. The personal approach of Decheng’s determination to express opinions at variance with the state provides an in-depth perspective of life in China at that time, but since Egg on Mao is written through the eyes of one ordinary man, the room for bias and variance of perspectives are plentiful.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eglantyne Jebb", "body": "thumbEglantyne Jebb (25 August 1876 – 17 December 1928) was a British social reformer.\\n\\nShe was born in 1876 in Ellesmere, Shropshire, and grew up on her family's estate. The Jebbs, apart from being a well-off family, also had a strong social conscience and commitment to public service; her mother, Eglantyne Louisa Jebb, had founded the Home Arts and Industries Association, to promote Arts and Crafts among young people in rural areas, her sister Louisa would help found the Women's Land Army in World War I, and another sister Dorothy Frances Jebb, married the Labour Party MP Charles Roden Buxton, campaigned against the demonisation of the German people after the war.\\n\\nHaving studied history at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, Eglantyne trained to become a school teacher, but a year's experience as a Primary School teacher, at St. Peter's Junior School in Marlborough, convinced her that this was not her vocation, though it increased her awareness of the difficulties and widespread nature of poverty faced by young children. She had a vision in which she saw the face of Jesus.\\n\\nShe moved to Cambridge to look after her sick mother. There she became involved in the Charity Organisation Society, which aimed to bring a modern scientific approach to charity work. This led her to carry out an extensive research project into conditions in the city, and in 1906 she published a book, Cambridge, a Study in Social Questions based on her research.\\n\\nNot much came of this work, and for several years she lived quietly, until in 1913 she was asked to undertake a journey to Macedonia on behalf of the Macedonian Relief Fund. She returned shortly before the First World War broke out, and soon was drawn into a project organised by Dorothy, who had begun importing European newspapers – including ones from Germany and Austria-Hungary for which a special licence had to be obtained from the government – and publishing extracts in English in the Cambridge Magazine, which revealed that everyday life in the enemy countries was far worse than government propaganda suggested.\\n\\nAs the war was coming to an end, and the German and Austro-Hungarian economies came near to collapse, it was clear to Dorothy and Eglantyne that the children of these countries were suffering appallingly from the effects of the war and the Allied blockade, which continued even when an armistice was signed. A pressure group, the Fight the Famine Council, was set up in 1919 to persuade the British government to end the blockade.\\n\\nSoon, however, the focus shifted to organising relief. On 15 April 1919, the Council set up a fund to raise money for the German and Austrian children – the Save the Children Fund. Unexpectedly, this organisation, launched at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 19 May 1919, quickly raised a large sum of money from the British public, and officials were despatched to organise relief work. \\n\\nThe success of the Fund led Eglantyne and Dorothy to attempt to set up an international movement for children. The International Save the Children Union (Union International de Secours a l'Enfant) was founded in Geneva in 1920, with the British Save the Children Fund and the Swedish Rädda Barnen as leading members. \\n\\nIn London, it was now Eglantyne who was in charge, and she ensured that the Fund adopted the professional approach she had learnt in the Charity Organisation Society. A manager, Lewis Golden, was recruited to put the organisation on a businesslike foundation. He adopted the innovative – and controversial – approach of taking full-page advertisements in national newspapers; it was highly effective, and raised very substantial amounts of income for the Fund's work.\\n\\nAs the problems in central Europe receded, there was a new focus of the Fund's attention – a refugee crisis in Greece and the surrounding areas, a consequence of the continuing conflict in the area. Then in 1921, just as this situation was coming under control, there was a new and bigger emergency. Partly as a consequence of the devastation of war, revolution and civil war, and partly due to the disastrous economic policies of the Bolshevik government, the people of Soviet Russia faced a famine as crops failed. A new fundraising effort brought a surge of donations, and a Save the Children team was dispatched to the city of Saratov, one of the main famine centres.\\n\\nIn all the work the Fund did, a major element in Eglantyne's thinking was the importance of a planned, research-based approach. In 1923, when the Russian relief effort was coming to an end, and the Fund's income was sharply reducing, she turned to another issue – that of children's rights. She headed to Geneva, to a meeting of the International Union, with a plan for a Children's Charter. The result was a short and clear document – drafted by Eglantyne – which asserted the rights of children and the duty of the international community to put children's rights in the forefront of planning. The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, or the Declaration of Geneva as it came to be known, was adopted a year later by the League of Nations.\\n\\nWith peace returning to Europe, and relief efforts in decline, the focus of the Save the Children movement shifted to promoting the Declaration. In 1925, the first International Child Welfare congress was held in Geneva. The Declaration was widely discussed and supported by organisations and governments. An expanded version would be adopted by the United Nations in 1959, and it was one of the main inspirations behind the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\\n\\nFor many years, Eglantyne had been suffering from ill-health and in 1928, following three operations for goitre, she died in a nursing home in Geneva, and is buried there in St George's cemetery. She is remembered today as the inspirational founder of the Save the Children organisation, which for almost 90 years has been innovative not just in marketing methods, but also in its internationalist, non-sectarian and professional approach.\\n\\n"}

As a 17 year old Zill enlisted in both the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung, switching to the SS as soon as it came to his hometown (in fact Zill was the 535 member of the SS nationally). Zill would later work as a security guard in a curtain factory and it was not until 1934 that he became a full-time SS man, serving as a guard at a minor concentration camp at Chemnitz.\\n\\nFrom this low beginning Zill began to rise through the ranks at the camps. His first appointment at a major camp was at Lichtenburg where he, along with fellow future commandant Arthur Rödl, guarded the camp borders. He moved between camps, seeing service at Dachau, Ravensbrück and Hinzert in various capacities. His first commandant role was at Natzweiler-Struthof before taking charge at Flossenbürg. As a commandant Zill expected his guards to act with the discipline of soldiers whilst also supporting the idea that camp inmates who had been indoctrinated into Nazism should be allowed to fight for Nazi Germany in return for their freedom. His regime as a commandant was also marked by extreme cruelty and according to the testimonies of inmates Zill's crimes included tying prisoners to trees before allowing his dogs to savage their genitalia. Zill was replaced in April 1943 by Max Kögel after being judged ineffective as a commandant. The move followed letters of complaint to Fritz Sauckel from the villagers about the high standards of living enjoyed by camp guards and their wives in contrast to the impoverished standards in the village, as well as a culture of corruption amongst the guards. He was transferred to the Eastern Front in 1943.\\n\\nNicknamed 'little Zill' because of his short stature he went to ground after the Second World War but revealed himself when he put his real name on the birth certificate of an illegitimate child. Sentenced to life imprisonment by a Munich court the sentence was reduced on appeal to fifteen years in 1955. Following his release Zill settled in Dachau where he died in 1974.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Egyptian National Railways", "body": "Egyptian National Railways (ENR) is the national railway of Egypt and managed by the parastatal Egyptian Railway Authority (ERA).\\n\\nthumbAlready in 1833, Pasha Mohammad Ali considered building a railway between Suez and Cairo to facilitate transit between Europe and India. Muhammad Ali had proceeded to buy the rail when the project was abandoned due to pressure by the French who had an interest in building a canal instead. The Suez Canal was eventually completed in 1869. After Mohamed Ali’s death Abbas I contracted with Robert Stephenson to link Alexandria and Cairo by rail. The first part of this railway between Alexandria and Kafer Eassa was opened in 1854, and the line was completed two years later representing the first railroad in Africa and in the Middle East, and the second in the world after the United Kingdom.\\n\\nThe Imbaba bridge was constructed in 1891 by Eng. David Trambley to allow trains to cross the Nile near Cairo, a key step to connect Lower and Upper Egypt. The contemporary Imbaba bridge was erected in 1924 and represents the only railway crossing of the Nile in Cairo. The El Ferdan Railway Bridge rebuilt in 2001 is the largest swing bridge in the world and crosses the Suez Canal.\\n\\nThe Palestine Railway linked El Kantara (East) with Palestine and Lebanon. It was built in two phases during the First and Second World War. Commenced in 1916, it was extended to Rafah on the border with Palestine as part of campaigns against the Ottoman Empire. The route was extended along the Mediterranean coast to link with Turkish Railways in 1940 and became a vital part of the supply route for Egypt.\\n\\nIn 2005 ENR operated 5,063 km of rail using standard gauge of 1435 mm. Most of the rail system is focused on the Nile delta with lines essentially fanning out from Cairo. In addition, there is a line to the west along the coast that eventually could link to Libya (as it did during World War II). From Cairo goes a major line south along the east bank of the Nile to Aswan (Sellel) in Upper Egypt. Neighboring Israel uses the same standard gauge but is no longer linked. In the South the railway system of Sudan operates on a narrow gauge and is reached after using the ferry past the Aswan dam. Rail service is a critical part of the transportation infrastructure of Egypt but of limited service for transit. 63 km of the network is electrified, namely commuter lines between Cairo-Helwan and Cairo-Heliopolis. \\n\\nThe vast majority of ENR locomotives are diesel. While ENR purchases locomotives and rail abroad, passenger coaches are built and refurbished in Egypt by the Société Générale Egyptienne de Matériel de Chemins de Fer (SEMAF). In 2009 ENR began taking delivery of 40 Electro-Motive Diesel JT42CWRM (Class 66) locomotives for passenger services.\\n\\nCargo volume transported by ENR is about 12 million ton annually.\\n\\nER is the backbone of passenger transportation in Egypt with 800 million passenger miles annually. Air-conditioned passenger trains usually have 1st and 2nd class service, while non-airconditioned trains have 2nd and 3rd class. Most of the network connects the densely populated area of the Nile delta with Cairo and Alexandria as hubs. Train fares in commuter trains and 3rd class passenger trains are kept low as a social service.\\n\\nThere are large volumes of tourist traffic during Eid; this causes problems due to a shortage of rolling stock.\\n\\nThe Alexandria-Cairo-Luxor-Aswan link is served daily in both directions by air-conditioned sleeper trains of Abela Egypt. This service is especially attractive to tourist who can spend the night on the train as it covers the stretch between Cairo and Luxor. A luxury express train also connects Cairo with Marsa Matruh towards the Libyan border.\\n\\nENR serves a number of places by bus services including Abu Simbel (bus/ferry), Sharm el Sheik, Siwa oasis, and Hurghada.\\n\\nThe Egyptian Railway Museum was founded in 1933 and chronicles the history and development of the ENR. It is near the Ramses Station in Cairo.\\n\\nThese recent accidents have been preceded by a succession other fatal accidents in the previous decade:\\n\\nThe debacle of the 2002 Al Ayyat train disaster showed significant deficiencies in the status and maintenance of the equipment. In the aftermath, the ERA initiated a program to update equipment and improve safety. While some services have been privatized (i.e. food service, sleeper trains), ENR is considering further steps in privatization to increase efficiency and improve service. In addition, ENR has dormant real estate holding that it plans to utilize in a more profitable way.\\n\\nThe 2006 Qalyoub rail crash led to further criticism of the management of the ENR raising issues of underfunding and corruption. The head of the ERA, Hanafy Abdel-Qawi, was dismissed one day after the accident. In response to the accidents an investment programme was launched in 2007 with the aim of modernising the rail network and improving safety standards.\\n\\nMost major lines originate from Ramses Station, Cairo or Misr Station, Alexandria: \\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumbThere is a modest network of narrow gauge railways at Kurna (the west Nile bank opposite Luxor). This has a gauge of approximately 2 ft (60 cm) and is used for transporting sugar cane. A smaller network of the same gauge and for the same purpose exists on the east bank, around the southern outskirts of Luxor.\\n\\nHaulage is by diesel locomotive. Rolling stock includes rakes of bogie bolsters, typically seen loaded high up with sugar cane crop. \\n\\nMore pictures\\n\\narz:الهيئه القوميه لسكك حديد مصر\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eikonal equation", "body": "The eikonal equation (from German Eikonal, which is from Greek εἰκών, image) is a non-linear partial differential equation encountered in problems of wave propagation, when the wave equation is approximated using the WKB theory. It is derivable from Maxwell's equations of electromagnetics, and provides a link between physical (wave) optics and geometric (ray) optics.\\n\\nThe eikonal equation is of the form\\n\\nsubject to , where  is an open set in  with well-behaved boundary,  is a function with positive values,  denotes the gradient and |·| is the Euclidean norm.

In the special case when , the solution gives the signed distance from .\\n\\nThe physical meaning of the eikonal equation is related to the formula\\n\\nwhere  is the electric field intensity and  is the electric potential. There is a similar equation for velocity potential in fluid flow and temperature in heat transfer. The physical meaning of this equation in the electromagnetic example is that any charge occurring in the region is pushed outward at a right angle from lines of constant potential and this charge travels along lines of constant force given by the field of the E vector. Corresponding variables occur in thermodynamics and fluid flow. Ray optics and electromagnetics are related by the fact that the eikonal equation gives a second electromagnetic formula of the same form as the potential equation above where the line of constant potential has been replaced by a line of constant phase and the force lines have been replaced by normal vectors coming out of the constant phase line at right angles. The magnitude of these normal vectors is given by the square root of the relative permittivity. The line of constant phase can be considered the edge of one of the advancing light waves. The normal vectors are the rays the light is traveling down in ray optics. This explanation is in the RMKS system of units used by electrical engineers.\\n\\nAn eikonal equation is one of the form\\n\\nThe plane  can be thought of as the initial condition, by thinking of  as  We could also solve the equation on a subset of this plane, or on a curved surface, with obvious modifications.This shows up in geometrical optics for example, where the equation is . There it is an equation describing the phase fronts of waves. The lucky thing is that, under reasonable hypothesis on the \"initial\" data, the eikonal equation admits a local solution. Unfortunately, a global solution (e.g. a solution for all time in the geometrical optics case) is not possible. The reason is that caustics may develop. In the geometrical optics case, this means that wavefronts cross.\\n\\nWe can solve the eikonal equation using the method of characteristics. Note though that one must make the \"non-characteristic\" hypothesis  for  We must also clearly assume , for \\n\\nFirst, solve the problem , . This is done by defining curves (and values of  on those curves) as\\n\\nThat these equations have a solution for some interval  follows from standard ODE theorems (using the non-characteristic hypothesis). These curves fill out an open set around the plane . Thus the curves define the value of  in an open set about our initial plane. Once defined as such it is easy to see using the chain rule that , and therefore  along these curves.\\n\\nWe want our solution  to satisfy , or more specifically, for every ,  Assuming for a minute that this is possible, for any solution  we must have\\n\\nand therefore\\n\\nIn other words, the solution  will be given in a neighborhood of the initial plane by an explicit equation. However, since the different paths , starting from different initial points may cross, the solution may become multi-valued, at which point we have developed caustics.We also have (even before showing that  is a solution)\\n\\nIt remains to show that , which we have defined in a neighborhood of our initial plane, is the gradient of some function . This will follow if we show that the vector field  is curl free. Consider the first term in the definition of . This term,  is curl free as it is the gradient of a function.

He then resigned to write a major genealogical work, but died before New Year. He was also a member of the editorial staff of the biographical dictionary Norsk biografisk leksikon. He began working there in 1924, and soon became editor-in-chief, as the three editors-in-chief Anders Krogvig, Gerhard Gran and Edvard Bull, Sr. died in 1924, 1925 and 1932 respectively. His period as editor-in-chief spanned the volumes three through fourteen. From 1934 Jansen had a number of co-editors, including A. W.

{"title": "Einstein (unit)", "body": "An einstein is a unit used in irradiance and in photochemistry. One einstein is defined as one mole of photon, regardless of their frequency. Therefore, the number of photons in an einstein is Avogadro's number, 6.022×10. Irradiance might be measured in einsteins per square metre per second, if the frequency is well defined, as for a monochromatic source. If the optical frequency is not well defined this is a sloppy misuse of the term irradiance, which is defined in terms of power per unit area.\\n\\nThe einstein is used in studies of photosynthesis since the light requirement for the production of a given quantity of oxygen is a fixed number of photosynthetically active photons (about nine photosynthetically active einsteins per mole of oxygen formed).\\n\\nIt is named in honor of Albert Einstein, who in a 1905 paper explained the photoelectric effect in terms of light quanta, now called photons, an idea introduced by Max Planck.\\n\\nPhotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is usually reported in microeinsteins per second per square meter, one microeinstein being one-millionth of an einstein.\\n\\n"}

The band describes its sound as \"Sonic Craft\" (Artesanía Sonora). This characterization comes from their combination of folkloric arrangements and lyrics combined with experimental rock and subtle electronic arrangements.\\n\\nThe musical instruments they employ range from: drums and percussion instruments, electric and acoustic guitars, electric bass, fretless bass, whistles, bells, miscellaneous wind instruments, etc. Their musical influence ranges from all variants of rock music, blues, free jazz, contemporary music, experimentation, Mexican traditional music. They often read stories in their live presentations between sets, with surreal and mythical themes. Their Lyrics are likewise of ethereal and mythical nature. Throughout their years active, they have created a unique musical experience; not only for the audience, but for themselves. \\n\\nSince they formed their band, they had thought of developing a musical proposal that would not limit them to the conscious restraints that other musicians often are limited by. They have achieved this distinction with their use of pantomime and theatrical elements on stage: An example of this is that vocalist, Alejandro Vázquez has painted his face as it is being distorted by standing behind a sheet of glass and wears different masks while singing. Alejandro Vázquez can be heard engaging the audience as he reads short stories between their live set of their album Suena Vivo, recorded live between January 2003 and October 2004, and features drummer Julián Villa who currently lives in Norway. The result in these lively performances has resulted in a positive reaction on the audience, as shown when they performed live for the presentation of their Suena Vivo album in 2004.\\n\\nThey have played in different types of venues, like theaters, bars, streets and festivals. Every time adapting their show to the venue they will be playing in. They have played with other Mexican musicians like Premiata Forneria Marconi, Santa Sabina, Azul Violeta, Cecilia Toussaint, Arturo Meza, Cabezas de Cera, Fratta, San Pascualito Rey, La Perra, etc .\\n\\n"}

{"title": "El Sistema", "body": "El Sistema is a publicly financed voluntary sector music education program in Venezuela, originally called Social Action for Music. Its official name is Fundación del Estado para el Sistema Nacional de las Orquestas Juveniles e Infantiles de Venezuela, (Fesnojiv), and sometimes translated to English as \"National Network of Youth and Children's Orchestras of Venezuela\"). El Sistema is a state foundation which watches over Venezuela's 125 youth orchestras and the instrumental training programmes which make them possible.\\n\\nEl Sistema has 30 symphony orchestras. But its greatest achievement are the 250,000 children who attend its music schools around the country, 90 percent of them from poor socio-economic backgrounds.\\n\\nIn 1975, Venezuela economist and musician José Antonio Abreu founded Social Action for Music and became its director. Abreu has navigated the program for the past 35 years through ten different administrations, flourishing under both the presidents of the 1980s and the leftist administration of Hugo Chávez. Combining political shrewdness with religious devotion, Abreu has dedicated himself to a utopian dream in which an orchestra represents the ideal society, and the sooner a child is nurtured in that environment, the better for all.\\n\\nThe Venezuelan government began fully financing Abreu's orchestra after it succeeded brilliantly at an international competition in 1977 in Aberdeen, Scotland. From the beginning, El Sistema fell under the dominion of social-services ministries, not the ministry of culture, which has strategically helped it to survive. The current Chavez administration has been the most generous patron of El Sistema so far, footing almost its entire annual operating budget as well as additional capital projects.Abreu received the National Music Prize for his work in 1979. Abreu was appointed as Special Ambassador for the development of a Global Network of Youth and Children orchestras and choirs by UNESCO in 1995, also as special representative for the development of network of orchestras within the framework of UNESCO's \"World Movement of Youth and Children Orchestras and Choirs\".\\n\\nIts network of 102 youth and 55 children's orchestras (numbering approximately 100,000 youngsters) later came under the supervision of the Ministry of Family, Health and Sports. As El Sistema, its goal is to use music for the protection of childhood through training, rehabilitation and prevention of criminal behaviour.\\n\\nThe program is known for rescuing young people in extremely impoverished circumstances from the environment of drug abuse and crime into which they would likely otherwise be drawn.  Participants of the program who have begun international careers include Gustavo Dudamel, Edicson Ruiz, Joen Vazquez, Pedro Eustache, L. Miguel Rojas, Edward Pulgar, Natalia Luis-Bassa, among others.\\n\\nIn September 2007, President Hugo Chávez announced on television a new government program, Misión Música, designed to provide tuition and music instruments to Venezuelan children, with Abreu present on the TV program.\\n\\nA documentary film has been produced on the subject of El Sistema, entitled Tocar y Luchar (\"Play and Fight\", 2004). The film has won several awards, including \"best documentary\" at the Cine Las Americas International Film Festival and also the Albuquerque Latino Film Festival. In 2008 another documentary made by Paul Smaczny and Maria Stodtmeier about the system will appear.  El Sistema has also been featured on news programs such as 60 Minutes.\\n\\nAn important product of El Sistema is the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra (Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar). In 2007 the orchestra made its debut at Carnegie Hall and at the BBC Proms début under the baton of Dudamel, receiving enthusiastic reviews. With top qualified musicians ElSistema has recently created a new Youth Orchestra named after Teresa Carreno that will start International touring this fall.\\n\\nOn 6 June 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank announced the granting of a US$150 million loan for the construction of seven regional centers of El Sistema throughout Venezuela. Many bankers within the IDB originally objected to the loan on the grounds that classical music is for the elite. In fact, the bank has conducted studies on the more than two million young people who have been educated in El Sistema which link participation in the program to improvements in school attendance and declines in juvenile delinquency. Weighing such benefits as a falloff in school drop-out rates and a decline in crime, the bank calculated that every dollar invested in El Sistema was reaping about $1.68 in social dividends. Supported by the government, El Sistema has started to introduce its music program into the public-school curriculum, aiming to be in every school and to support 500,000 children by 2015.\\n\\nThe project has been extended to the penal system.

{"title": "Elakala Falls", "body": "The Elakala Falls are a series of four waterfall of Shays Run as it descends into the Blackwater Canyon in West Virginia. They are within Blackwater Falls State Park and are quite popular among photographers, with the ease of access for the first waterfall, and the relatively low traffic of the other waterfalls in the series. The first of the series of waterfalls is  in height and is easily accessible from park trails. It is the second most popular waterfall in the park. From the official Elakala trail there is a bridge over the top of the first waterfall offering easy access and views. The remaining three waterfalls of the series are progressively more difficult to access, and have no official marked trails to them. The gorge is nearly 200 feet deep at this section accounting for the difficulty of the descent to the lower waterfalls of the series.\\n\\nThe second waterfall is only  tall and is the smallest in the series, yet remains popular by the well worn path from the first falls. The third waterfall of the series is the highest at  tall but is particularly difficult to reach. It has a path worn to it but is very steep and rocky terrain. Traveling beyond the second waterfall should be considered for experienced hikers only due to the danger of descending the canyon without trails. The fourth and final waterfall of the series is considered quite dangerous to access, with no trails, and should not be attempted by inexperienced hikers.\\n\\nThe name of the waterfalls comes from a Native American legend, although several significantly different versions exist. According to one account it involves a princess named Elakala who threw herself over the edge of the first waterfall when her lover scorned her. Another account of the legend involves a Massawomee warrior named Elakala who was girl-shy and fell to his death from the falls while being pursued by two women of his tribe. Similar legends exist for many waterfalls in the eastern United States, and there is of course no way to confirm these stories.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elam", "body": "Elam was an ancient civilization located in what is now southwest Iran. Elam was centered in the far west and the southwest of modern-day Iran, stretching from the lowlands of Khuzestan and Ilam Province, as well as a small part of southern Iraq. The name is a transcription from Biblical Hebrew, corresponding to the Sumerian elam(a), the Akkadian elamtu, and the Elamite hatamti. Elamite states were among the leading political forces of the ancient near east.\\n\\nSituated just to the east of Mesopotamia, Elam was part of the early urbanization during the Chalcolithic period (Copper Age). The emergence of written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Mesopotamian history. In the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age), Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau, centered in Anshan, and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands. Its culture played a crucial role in the Gutian Empire, especially during the Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded it, when the Elamite language remained among those in official use.\\n\\nThe Elamite language has no established affinities with any other, and seems to be a language isolate such as Sumerian. Some researchers have posited the existence of a larger group known as Elamo-Dravidian. Linguists such as Václav Blažek and Georgiy Starostin have criticized the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis and concluded that the Elamite language was related to Afroasiatic languages. These theories have been heavily criticized.\\n\\nThe Elamites called their country Haltamti, Sumerian ELAM, Akkadian Elamû, female Elamītu \"resident of Susiana, Elamite\". Additionally, it is known as Elam in the Hebrew Bible, where they are called the offspring of Elam, eldest son of Shem (see Elam in the Bible; Genesis 10:22, Ezra 4:9).\\n\\nThe high country of Elam was increasingly identified by its low-lying later capital, Susa. Geographers after Ptolemy called it Susiana. The Elamite civilization was primarily centered in the province of what is modern-day Khuzestān and extended into the later province of Fars in prehistoric times. The modern provincial name Khuzestān is derived from Persian: Old Persian Hūjiya \"Elam\" () became Middle Persian Huź \"Susiana\" and New Persian Xuz, gaining the common New Persian location ending -stån \"place\" (cf. Sistan \"Saka-land\").\\n\\nKnowledge of Elamite history remains largely fragmentary, reconstruction being based on mainly Mesopotamia sources. The history of Elam is conventionally divided into three periods, spanning more than two millennia. The period before the first Elamite period is known as the proto-Elamite period:\\n\\nleftProto-Elamite civilization grew up east of the Tigris and Euphrates river valley, it was a combination of the lowlands and the immediate highland areas to the north and east. At least three proto-Elamite states merged to form Elam. Anshan (modern Fars), Awan (modern Luristan), and Shimashki (modern Kerman) to this core Shushiana (modern Khuzestan) was periodically annexed and broken off. In addition, some Proto-Elamite sites are found well outside this area, spread out on the Iranian plateau; such as Sialk (modern Isfahan Province) and Jiroft  in Kerman Province. The state of Elam was formed from these lesser states as a response to invasion from Sumer during the Old Elamite period. Elamite strength was based on an ability to hold these various areas together under a coordinated government that permitted the maximum interchange of the natural resources unique to each region. Traditionally, this was done through a federated governmental structure. \\n\\nThe Proto-Elamite city of Susa was founded around 5000 BCE in the watershed of the river Karun. It is considered to be the site of Proto-Elamite cultural formation. During its early history, it fluctuated between submission to Mesopotamian and Elamite power. The earliest levels (22–17 in the excavations conducted by Le Brun, 1978) exhibit pottery that has no equivalent in Mesopotamia, but for the succeeding period, the excavated material allows identification with the culture of Sumer of the Uruk period. Proto-Elamite influence from the Persian plateau in Susa becomes visible from about 3200 BC, and texts in the still undeciphered Proto-Elamite writing system continue to be present until about 2700 BC. The Proto-Elamite period ends with the establishment of the Awan dynasty. The earliest known historical figure connected with Elam is the king Enmebaragesi of Kish (c. 2650 BC?), who subdued it, according to the Sumerian king list. Elamite history can only be traced from records dating to beginning of the Akkadian Empire in around 2300 BC onwards.\\n\\nThe Proto-Elamite states in Jiroft and Zabol, present a special case because of their great antiquity. Archaeologists have suggested that a close relationship between the Jiroft civilisation and the Elamite civilisation is evidenced by striking similarities in art and culture, as well as by Elamite language writings found in Jiroft—possibly extending the Elamite presence to as early as 7000 BCE.\\n\\nframeThe Old Elamite period began around 2700 BC. Historical records mention the conquest of Elam by Enmebaragesi of Kish. Three dynasties ruled during this period. We know of twelve kings of each of the first two dynasties, those of Awan (or Avan; c. 2400–2100 BC) and Simash (c. 2100–1970 BC), from a list from Susa dating to the Old Babylonian period. Two Elamite dynasties said to have exercised brief control over Sumer in very early times include Awan and Hamazi; and likewise, several of the stronger Sumerian rulers, such as Eannatum of Lagash and Lugal-anne-mundu of Adab, are recorded as temporarily dominating Elam.\\n\\nthumbthumb The Avan dynasty was partly contemporary with that of Sargon of Akkad, who not only defeated the Awan king Luhi-ishan and subjected Susa, but attempted to make Akkadian the official language there. From this time, Mesopotamian sources concerning Elam become more frequent, since the Mesopotamians had developed an interest in resources (such as wood, stone, and metal) from the Iranian plateau, and military expeditions to the area became more common.\\n\\nWith the collapse of Akkad under Sargon's great-grandson, Shar-kali-sharri, Elam declared independence under the last Avan king, Kutik-Inshushinak (c. 2240–2220 BC), and threw off the Akkadian language, promoting in its place the brief Linear Elamite script.\\n\\nKutik-Inshushinnak conquered Susa and Anshan, and seems to have achieved some sort of political unity. Following his reign, the Awan dynasty collapsed as Elam was temporarily overrun by the Guti.\\n\\nAbout a century later, Shulgi of Ur retook the city of Susa and the surrounding region. During the first part of the rule of the Simashki dynasty, Elam was under intermittent attack from Mesopotamians and Gutians, alternating with periods of peace and diplomatic approaches. Shu-Sin of Ur, for example, gave one of his daughters in marriage to a prince of Anshan. But the power of the Sumerians was waning; Ibbi-Sin in the 21st century did not manage to penetrate far into Elam, and in 2004 BC, the Elamites, allied with the people of Susa and led by king Kindattu, the sixth king of Simashk, managed to sack Ur and lead Ibbi-Sin into captivity—thus ending the third dynasty of Ur. The kings of Isin, successor state to Ur, did manage to drive the Elamites out of Ur, rebuild the city, and to return the statue of Nanna that the Elamites had plundered.thumbThe succeeding dynasty, the Eparti (c. 1970–1770 BC), also called \"of the sukkalmahs\" because of the title borne by its members, was contemporary with the Old Babylonian period in Mesopotamia. This period is confusing and difficult to reconstruct. It was apparently founded by Eparti I. During this time, Susa was under Elamite control, but Mesopotamian states such as Larsa continually tried to retake the city. Around 1850 BC Kudur-mabug, apparently king of another Elamite state to the north of Susa, managed to install his son, Warad-Sin, on the throne of Larsa, and Warad-Sin's brother, Rim-Sin, succeeded him and conquered much of Mesopotamia for Larsa.\\n\\nNotable Eparti dynasty rulers in Elam during this time include Sirukdukh (c. 1850 BC), who entered various military coalitions to contain the rising power of Babylon; Siwe-Palar-Khuppak, who for some time was the most powerful person in the area, respectfully addressed as \"Father\" by Mesopotamian kings such as Zimrilim of Mari, and even Hammurabi of Babylon, and Kudur-Nahhunte, who plundered the temples of Akkad. But Elamite influence in Mesopotamia did not last. Around 1760 BC, Hammurabi drove out the Elamites, overthrew Rim-Sin of Larsa, and established Babylonian dominance in Mesopotamia.\\n\\nLittle is known about the latter part of this dynasty, since sources again become sparse with the Kassite rule of Babylon (from c. 1595 BC).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe Middle Elamite period began with the rise of the Anshanite dynasties around 1500 BC. Their rule was characterized by an \"Elamisation\" of Susa, and the kings took the title \"king of Anshan and Susa\". While the first of these dynasties, the Kidinuids continued to use the Akkadian language frequently in their inscriptions, the succeeding Igihalkids and Shutrukids used Elamite with increasing regularity. Likewise, Elamite language and culture grew in importance in Susiana.\\n\\nThe Kidinuids (c. 1500–1400) are a group of five rulers of uncertain affiliation. They are identified by their use of the older title, \"king of Susa and of Anshan\", and by calling themselves \"servant of Kirwashir\", an Elamite deity, thereby introducing the pantheon of the highlands to Susiana.\\n\\nOf the Igehalkids (c. 1400–1210), ten rulers are known, and there were possibly more. Some of them married Kassite princesses. The Kassite king Kurigalzu II temporarily occupied Elam c. 1320 BC, and later (c. 1230) another Kassite king, Kashtiliash IV, fought Elam unsuccessfully. Kiddin-Khutran I of Elam repulsed the Kassites by defeating Enlil-nadin-shumi in 1224 and Adad-shuma-iddina around 1222–1217. Under the Igehalkids, Akkadian inscriptions were rare, and Elamite highland gods became firmly established in Susa.\\n\\nUnder the Shutrukids (c. 1210–1100), the Elamite empire reached the height of its power. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte and his three sons, Kutir-Nakhkhunte II, Shilhak-In-Shushinak, and Khutelutush-In-Shushinak were capable of frequent military campaigns into Kassite Mesopotamia, and at the same time were exhibiting vigorous construction activity—building and restoring luxurious temples in Susa and across their Empire. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte raided Akkad, Babylon, and Eshnunna, carrying home to Susa trophies like the statues of Marduk and Manishtushu, the Manishtushu Obelisk, the Stele of Hammurabi and the stela of Naram-Sin.\\n\\nIn 1158 BC, Shutruk-Nakhkhunte defeated the Kassites permanently, killing the Kassite king of Babylon, Zababa-shuma-iddina, and replacing him with his eldest son, Kutir-Nakhkhunte, who held it no more than three years.\\n\\nKutir-Nakhkhunte's son Khutelutush-In-Shushinak was probably of an incestuous relation of Kutir-Nakhkhunte's with his own daughter, Nakhkhunte-utu. He ended up temporarily yielding Susa to the forces of Nebuchadnezzar I of Babylon, who returned the statue of Marduk. He fled to Anshan, but later returned to Susa, and his brother Shilhana-Hamru-Lagamar may have succeeded him as last king of the Shutrukid dynasty. Following Khutelutush-In-Shushinak, the power of the Elamite empire began to wane seriously, for with this ruler, Elam disappears into obscurity for more than three centuries.\\n\\nVery little is known of this period. Anshan was still at least partially Elamite. There appear to have been alliances of Elam and Babylonia against the Assyrians; the Babylonian king Mar-biti-apla-ushur (984–979) was of Elamite origin, and Elamites are recorded to have fought with the Babylonian king Marduk-balassu-iqbi against the Assyrian forces under Shamshi-Adad V (823–811).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe later Neo-Elamite period is characterized by a significant migration of Iranians to the Iranian plateau. Assyrian sources beginning around 800 BC distinguish the \"powerful Medes\", i.e. the actual Medes, and other iranian /aryan tribes that would later enter history under their proper names, (Parthians, Sagartians, Margians, Bactrians, Sogdians etc.). Among these pressuring tribes were the Parsu, first recorded in 844 BC as living on the southeastern shore of Lake Urmiah, but who by the end of this period would cause the Elamites' original home, the Iranian Plateau, to be renamed Persia proper.\\n\\nMore details are known from the late 8th century BC, when the Elamites were allied with Merodach-baladan to defend the cause of Babylonian independence from Assyria. Khumbanigash (743–717) supported Merodach-baladan against Sargon II, apparently with limited success; while his successor, Shutruk-Nakhkhunte II (716–699), was routed by Sargon's troops during an expedition in 710, and another Elamite defeat by Sargon's troops is recorded for 708. The Assyrian victory over Babylon was completed by Sargon's son Sennacherib, who dethroned Merodach-baladan for a second time, finally installing his own son Ashur-nadin-shumi on the Babylonian throne in 700.\\n\\nShutruk-Nakhkhunte II, the last Elamite to claim the old title \"king of Anshan and Susa\", was murdered by his brother Khallushu, who managed to capture Ashur-nadin-shumi and Babylon in 694. Khallushu was in turn assassinated by Kutir-Nakhkhunte, who succeeded him, but soon abdicated in favor of Khumma-Menanu III (692–689). Khumma-Menanu recruited a new army to help the Babylonians against the Assyrians at the battle of Halule in 691 BC. The battle was indecisive, or at least both sides claimed the victory in their annals, but Babylon was destroyed by Sennacherib only two years later.\\n\\nThe reigns of Khumma-Khaldash I (688–681) and Khumma-Khaldash II (680–675) saw a deterioration of Elamite-Babylonian relations, and both of them raided Sippar. At the beginning of Esarhaddon's reign in Assyria (681–669), Nabu-zer-kitti-lišir, an ethnically Elamite governor in the south of Babylonia, revolted and besieged Ur, but fled to Elam where \"the king of Elam took him prisoner and put him to the sword\" (ABC 1 Col.3:39–42).\\n\\nUrtaku (674–664) for some time maintained good relations with Assurbanipal (668–627), who sent wheat to Susiana during a famine. But these friendly relations were only temporary, and Urtaku died during another Elamite attack on Mesopotamia.\\n\\nHis successor Tempti-Khumma-In-Shushinak (664–653) was counter-attacked by Assurbanipal, and was killed following the battle of the Ulaï in 653 BC; and Susa was occupied by the Assyrians. In this same year the Mede state to the north fell to the Scythian under Madius, immediately displacing the Parsu tribe to Anshan—which their king Teispes captured that same year, turning it for the first time into an Indo-Iranian kingdom that would a century later become the nucleus of the Achaemenid dynasty. \\n\\nDuring a brief respite provided by the civil war between Assurbanipal and his brother Shamash-shum-ukin, the Elamites too indulged in fighting among themselves, so weakening the Elamite kingdom that in 646 BC Assurbanipal devastated Susiana with ease, and sacked Susa. A succession of brief reigns continued in Elam from 651 to 640, each of them ended either due to usurpation, or because of capture of their king by the Assyrians. In this manner, the last Elamite king, Khumma-Khaldash III, was captured in 640 BC by Ashurbanipal, who devastated the country.\\n\\nIn a tablet unearthed in 1854 by Henry Austin Layard, Ashurbanipal boasts of the destruction he had wrought:\\n\\nThe devastation was less complete than Assurbanipal boasted, and Elamite rule was resurrected soon after with Shuttir-Nakhkhunte, son of III (not to be confused with Shuttir-Nakhkhunte, son of Indada, a petty king in the first half of the 6th century).Elamite royalty in the final century preceding the Achaemenidswas fragmented among different small kingdoms. The three kings at the close of the 7th century (Shuttir-Nakhkhunte, Khallutush-In-Shushinak and Atta-Khumma-In-Shushinak ) still called themselves \"king of Anzan and of Susa\" or \"enlarger of the kingdom of Anzan and of Susa\", at a time when the Achaemenids were already ruling Anshan.Their successors Khumma-Menanu and Shilhak-In-Shushinak II bore the simple title \"king\", and the final king Tempti-Khumma-In-Shushinak boasted no title altogether. In 540 BC, Achaemenid rule begins in Susa.\\n\\nlist of cites annexed to the Elamite federation:\\n\\nthumbThe Elamites practised polytheism. Our knowledge about their religion is scant, but at one point they had a pantheon of gods headed by the god Khumban which included the goddess Kiririsha and the god Inshushinak.\\n\\nElamite is unrelated to the neighboring Semitic, Sumerian, and Indo-European languages. It was written in a cuneiform adapted from Akkadian script, although the very earliest documents were written in the quite different \"Linear Elamite\" script. In 2006, two even older inscriptions in a similar script were discovered at Jiroft to the east, leading archaeologists to speculate that Linear Elamite had spread from there to Susa. It seems to have developed from an even earlier writing known as \"proto-Elamite\", but scholars are not unanimous on whether or not this script was used to write Elamite or another language, and it has not yet been deciphered.\\n\\nDavid McAlpine believes Elamite may be related to the living Dravidian languages (of southern India, and Brahui in Pakistan). The hypothesized family of Elamo-Dravidian languages may further prove to be connected with the Indus Valley Civilization somewhat to the East, possibly corresponding to Meluhha in Sumerian records. Such links are at best conjectural, and Harappan pictographs have also yet to be deciphered.\\n\\nSeveral stages of the language are attested; the earliest date back to the third millennium BC, the latest to the Achaemenid Empire.\\n\\nThe Elamite language may have survived as late as the early Islamic period. Ibn al-Nadim among other Islamic medieval historians, for instance, wrote that \"The Iranian languages are Fahlavi (Pahlavi), Dari, Khuzi, Persian and Suryani\", and Ibn Moqaffa noted that Khuzi was the unofficial language of the royalty of Persia, \"Khuz\" being the corrupted name for Elam.\\n\\nrightThe Assyrians boasted that they had utterly destroyed the Elamites, but new polities emerged in the area after Assyrian power faded. Among the nations that benefited from the decline of the Assyrians were the Iranian tribes, whose presence around Lake Urmia to the north of Elam is attested from the 9th century BC in Assyrian texts.Some time after that region fell to Madius the Scythian (653 BC), Teispes son of Achaemenes conquered Elamite Anshan in the mid 7th century BC, forming a nucleus that would expand into the Persian Empire.\\n\\nThe rise of the Achaemenid in the 6th century BC brought an end to the existence of Elam as an independent political power \"but not as a cultural entity\" (Encyclopædia Iranica, Columbia University). Indigenous Elamite traditions, such as the use of the title \"king of Anshan\" by Cyrus the Great; the \"Elamite robe\" worn by Cambyses I of Anshan and seen on the famous winged genii at Pasargadae; some glyptic styles; the use of Elamite as the first of three official languages of the empire used in thousands of administrative texts found at Darius’ city of Persepolis; the continued worship of Elamite deities; and the persistence of Elamite religious personnel and cults supported by the crown, formed an essential part of the newly emerging Achaemenid culture in Persian Iran. The Elamites thus became the conduit by which achievements of the Mesopotamian civilizations were introduced to the tribes of the Iranian plateau.\\n\\nConversely, Elamites had \"absorbed Iranian influences in both structure and vocabulary\" by 500 BC,suggesting a form of cultural continuity or fusion connecting the Elamite and the Persian periods.\\n\\nThe name of \"Elam\" survived into the Hellenistic period and beyond.In its Greek form, Elymais, it emerges as designating a semi-independent state under Parthia suzerainty during the 2nd century BC to the early 3rd century AD.In Acts 2:8-9 in the New Testament, the language of the  Elamitēs is one of the languages heard at the Pentecost.From 410 onwards Elam (Beth Huzaye) was the senior metropolitan province of the Church of the East, surviving into the 14th century.\\n\\n"}

Eldest ends at the Battle of the Burning Plains, where Eragon faces a new Dragon Rider, Murtagh, and a new dragon, Thorn.\\n\\nReviews pointed out the similarities between Eldest and other works such as The Lord of the Rings, while praising the themes of the book, such as friendship and honor. Several of these reviews commented on the style and genre of Eldest, while others considered the possibility of a film adaptation similar to the adaption of its prequel Eragon.\\n\\nEldest begins three days after the events of the preceding novel, Eragon, in the dwarf city of Tronjheim, inside of a hollowed mountain named Farthen Dûr. Farthen Dûr is in the southeastern part of Alagaësia, the fictional continent where the Inheritance Cycle takes place. Throughout the novel, the protagonists travel to many different places: Ellesméra, the elven capital city located in the forest Du Weldenvarden, on the northern portion of Alagaësia; Carvahall, a city located on the northwestern part of Alagaësia in Palancar Valley; and Aberon, the capital of Surda, located in the southern portion of Alagaësia, as examples.\\n\\nThe story is told in third-person through protagonists Eragon, Roran, and Nasuada. Eragon is nearly always accompanied by his dragon Saphira. Due to the multiple points-of-view, multiple stories take place concurrently, and the protagonist characters do not meet often. Several other characters return from Eragon, including Arya (the elf maiden), Orik, Ajihad (the King of the Varden), and Angela (the herbalogist), while some new characters appear, such as Oromis and the dragon Glaedr. Murtagh appears briefly as a minor protagonist, then reappears later as a primary antagonist with his dragon, Thorn. Galbatorix and the Ra'zac also reprise their roles as primary antagonists.\\n\\nEldest begins as Ajihad, the leader of the rebel Varden force, is ambushed and killed, with Murtagh gone while Ajihad's other guards are assumed dead. At his funeral, Ajihad's daughter Nasuada is elected to command the Varden. The protagonists Eragon and Saphira then decide to travel to the forest Du Weldenvarden to become trained as a Dragon Rider by the elves. Once there, Eragon meets Oromis and his dragon Glaedr, the only dragon and Rider secretly alive besides Eragon, Saphira and Galbatorix. Oromis and Glaedr, however, are both crippled, and so cannot fight Galbatorix and must hide to avoid Galbatorix hunting them down. Eragon and Saphira are taught the use of logic, magic theory, scholarship, and combat, among other things.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Nasuada chooses to move the Varden from Tronjheim to Surda, to mount an attack on the Empire. The Varden suffers financial troubles, however, until Nasuada learns that she can create an expensive lace with magic, and sell it at extremely low rates. One night when Nasuada is in her room, a character named Elva saves her from an assassination attempt. Elva is enchanted, and locates the assailant, who is killed after unwillingly surrendering information to Varden magicians about a subversive group based in Surda called the Black Hand, who is plotting to kill Nasuada. Nasuada later attends a meeting with key figures in Surda's government to discuss a potential upcoming battle against the Empire. They learn that the conflict is coming sooner than they initially suspected, and mobilize forces to attack, as well as sending for help from the dwarves.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Eragon continues his training, but is discouraged when the scar on his back causes him to have seizures multiple times per day. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Roran is hunted by the Ra'zac in Carvahall. He eventually persuades the entire village to attack the Ra'zac in the night, and succeeds in driving them off. After more conflicts with the village, the Ra'zac manage to kidnap Katrina, Roran's fiancée. Roran then stirs the village to mobilize, departing on a journey to join the Varden in Surda. He leads them to Narda, and then by sea to Teirm. In Teirm, they meet Jeod, who helps them pirate a new vessel from Teirm. Pursued by sloops from the Empire, the vessel manages to escape through a whirlpool, and eventually makes it to Surda, arriving just as the Battle of the Burning Plains is about to begin between Surda and its allies, and the Empire.\\n\\nWhen the conflict begins, Eragon is able to repel the opposing army using magic. Eventually, a Dragon Rider appears in favor of the Empire. The hostile Dragon Rider kills the dwarf king Hrothgar, and soon begins to fight with Eragon. The Dragon Rider is soon unmasked by Eragon and is revealed to be Murtagh. Murtagh tells Eragon that he was kidnapped and forced into loyalty by Galbatorix after a dragon hatched for him. Murtagh outmatches Eragon, but shows mercy due to their old friendship. Before leaving, Murtagh reveals that Eragon is his brother, and takes Eragon's sword as well. Ultimately, Galbatorix's army is forced to retreat after the arrival of the dwarves and the departure of Murtagh and Thorn. In the end, Eragon and Roran decide that they will seek out Katrina together.\\n\\nEldest received mixed reviews by critics. School Library Journal noted that Eldest lacked originality, but would still find reception among fans. It also acknowledged that themes of Eldest are based generally on the works of other writers. BookBrowse also criticized Eldest, but said, as School Library Journal noted, that nothing the reviewers can say will stop some children from reading the book. Entertainment Weekly rated Eldest as one of the worst five books of 2005, calling it a \"700-page drag.\" As of 2010, there are no plans for Eldest being made into a movie.\\n\\nA deluxe version of Eldest called the \"Limited Edition\" was released on September 26, 2006. It was published by Random House. The deluxe edition included an excerpt of Brisingr, a poster of Glaedr (which would become the cover art for Brisingr), the history of Alagaësia, art by Christopher Paolini, and a list of characters, places, objects, and dwarf clans. The deluxe edition was also released in an Ebook format.\\n\\nEldest has been published in forty-one countries, several translation from English into different languages have been made. Translations for languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Serbian have appeared. Worldwide Eldest has several publishers including Gailivro, which publishes the Polish and Portuguese Eldest, and Gramedia Pustaka Utama, the publisher of the Indonesian translations.\\n\\nAn omnibus of Eragon and Eldest was published on July 8, 2008 and included never-before-seen manuscripts by Christopher Paolini.\\n\\n"}

She taught in schools in both Indianapolis and Chicago. She wrote for the Chicago Tribune under the pseudonym \"Nora Marks\" during the late 1890s, and later became publisher of the Little Chronicle Publishing Company, Chicago; this published several of her own works, along with other educational books and the Little Chronicle, an illustrated newspaper intended for young children.\\n\\nWhilst she wrote both fiction and non-fiction, the former mostly romances and the latter mostly educational books, she is best known for her 1912 novel Greyfriars Bobby.\\n\\nThis popular work recounted the famous story of the eponymous dog; most of the modern versions of the story seem to stem from her form of the tale. Many details of the book, especially those regarding the dog's master are inaccurate; until recently it was assumed that she had no opportunity for original research of her setting. It seems likely that she worked from the basic story and embellished it from her own imagination. The story, however, is lovingly detailed; the descriptions of the geography may be somewhat confused, but effort was clearly made to get names correct, and to get across the atmosphere of the city. Unusually for someone with no connection to the country, her portrayal of the local accent was convincing and strongly phrased; this suggests it is possible she picked up the story directly from Scottish immigrants to the Midwest.\\n\\nThe book is often considered a classic, especially for children, and has been reprinted several times; it was the basis for the films Challenge to Lassie (MGM, 1949) and Greyfriars Bobby: The True Story of a Dog (Disney, 1961), although both of these postdated her death.\\n\\nHer writings included:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Election stock market", "body": "Election stock markets (also referred to as election prediction markets) are financial market in which the ultimate values of the contract being traded are based on the outcome of elections. Participants invest their own funds, buy and sell listed contracts, earn profits and bear the risk of losing money. Election stock markets function like other futures exchange, such as commodity exchanges for the future delivery of grain, livestock, or precious metal.\\n\\nThe main purpose of an election stock market is to predict the election outcome, such as the share of the popular vote or share of seats each political party receives in a legislature or parliament. Efficient markets are very good at reflecting all available information, often reflecting information faster than opinion poll, which take several days to complete and process. Traders also have a strong financial incentive to reflect their true opinion about the election outcome regardless of their political preferences.\\n\\nElection stock markets are also used for research and teaching purposes. Researchers can study trader behavior and market operations. Election stock markets also teach participants the fundamentals of trading, such as how to take a long or a short position. A list of related academic research papers appears below.\\n\\nIn North America, two universities have been operating election stock markets for over a decade. The University of Iowa's Tippie College of Business has been operating the Iowa Electronic Markets . The Iowa markets primarily track presidential and congressional elections. In Canada, the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business has been operating the UBC Election Stock Market. The UBC markets track federal and provincial elections in Canada. The Iowa and UBC markets are non-profit operations for research purposes. These markets do not charge commissions or transaction fees. Investments are typically limited to USD 500 or CAD 1,000. \\n\\nPrivately run prediction markets have also emerged in recent years. Unlike their university counterparts, commercial prediction markets charge fees or commissions to cover their operating costs. Commercial markets may charge fees per transaction or commissions on net profits, and fees per transaction may be differentiated for price takers (those placing a market order) and price makers (those placing a limit order). Examples of commercial prediction markets include Intrade Prediction Markets and The Washington Stock Exchange; both track predictions for a broad set of political events. Commercial prediction markets claim that they attract more investment and generate more trading volume than their academic counterparts as they don't limit a trader's capital investment. The prediction accuracy of commercial and academic election stock markets is an area of active research (see below).\\n\\nThere are two basic types of election stock markets. The first type is a winner-takes-all market in which only one contract pays a fixed sum, typically $1, and all other contracts pay $0. Examples of this type of winner-takes-all market include a referendum outcome (yes or no), one of several parties winning an absolute majority, or one of several parties winning a plurality.\\n\\nThe other type of election stock market is a proportional share market where the payout of several contracts is determined by percentage proportions of a particular outcome, multiplied by a fixed sum that is typically $1. Two examples of such a market include a seats share market, where payouts are determined by the percentage share of seats that a particular party gains in a parliament, or a popular vote share market, where payouts are determined by the percentage share of a party's popular vote.\\n\\nThe common principle across different types of election stock markets is that the payouts for a \"unit portfolio\" of contracts must add up to a fixed amount, typically $1.\\n\\nContracts are put into circulation through the purchase of a unit portfolio. A trader purchases a set of all contracts in a particular market worth $1. Consider an election in which three parties compete, a Red Party, a Blue Party, and a Green Party. The share of popular votes for each party must sum to 100% by definition, so holding on to one contract for each of the three parties will always be worth $1 no matter what the election outcome. Buying unit portfolios allows trader to take a short position by selling contracts that they think are overvalued.\\n\\nTraders buy and sell contracts, which are typically quoted in 1/10-th of a cent corresponding to 1/10-th of a percentage point for the votes share or seats share of a political party. Traders make profits by buying undervalued contracts and selling overvalued contracts. If a trader expects the Blue Party to win 42.3% of the popular vote, the trader will find it profitable to buy a contract of the Blue Party if a seller offers it for less than 42.3 cents. The same trader will find it profitable to sell the same contract if another trader is willing to buy it for more than 42.3 cents.\\n\\nA trader takes a long position by buying low and selling high. Consider an investor who considers the purchase of a contract in the Blue Party, which is currently offered for 39.3 cents in the market. The investor predicts that the Blue Party will win more than 41%, and buys a contract of the Blue Party for 39.3 cents. On election day the Blue Party wins 42.5% of the popular vote, and the trader realizes a profit of 3.2 cents, an 8.1% return on investment.\\n\\nConsider a trader who has bought a unit portfolio consisting of one contract each for the Red Party, the Blue Party, and the Green Party, at a cost of $1. Believing that the contract for the Blue Party is overvalued at its current price, the trader sells one contract of the Blue Party for 30 cents. On election day the Red Party wins 55% of the vote, the Blue Party wins 25% of the vote, and the Green Party wins 20%. The trader now receives 75 cents in total for the Red Party and Green Party contracts, and has an additional 30 cents from the sale of the Blue Party contract. The trader has now $1.05 and has made a profit of 5 cents on an investment of $1.\\n\\nElection stock markets typically cease trading the day before the election is held. The markets are liquidated after the election based on the election outcome. In markets for the popular vote share and the parliamentary seats share, each contract is valued precisely equal to the corresponding percentage share. In winner-takes-all markets, the winning contract pays $1, while the losing contracts pay $0.\\n\\nElection stock markets are prediction markets for a particular purpose: elections. Even though election stock markets have been conducted for almost twenty years, the accuracy of these markets is nearly always judged by comparing the election stock market prediction (closing prices) on election eve with final pre-election polls and actual outcomes. Evidence that election stock markets perform remarkably well predicting election outcomes is found in a string of academic papers, mostly based on data from the Iowa Electronic Markets and the UBC Election Stock Market. Accuracy is typically measured as the average absolute forecast error for vote shares and seat shares. A more rigorous attempt to assess the performance of election stock markets is found in Berg et al. (2008); they report that for five recent elections covered by the Iowa Electronic Markets, the average absolute error in the market's prediction of the major-party presidential vote share across the 5 days prior to the election was 1.20 percentage points, while opinion polls conducted during that same time had an average error of 1.62 percentage points. Berg et al. (2008) also report evidence that election stock markets outperform polls for longer time periods before the election date. \\n\\nErikson and Wlezien (2008) challenge the view that election stock markets outperform polls. They argue that polls only measure preferences on the polling day, whereas election stock markets forecast the outcome on election day. When poll leads are discounted using statistical techniques, they find that poll-based forecasts outperform vote-share market prices.\\n\\nA critical feature for the proper functioning of election stock markets is market liquidity. As prediction markets function through aggregation of beliefs and opinions into market prices, high trading volume and/or a continuous stream of new investments are essential for prices to provide an accurate forecast of the election outcome. Signs that liquidity is lacking in an election stock market include wide spreads (large differences between bid and ask prices) and arbitrage opportunities (where the sum of bid prices exceeds the value of a unit portfolio, or where the sum of ask prices is lower than the value of a unit portfolio). As election stock markets are opinion aggregators, the accuracy of such markets can be expected to increase with the number of market participants. Investment caps (as maintained by the Iowa Electronic Markets and the UBC Election Stock Market) level the trading opportunities among traders. Whether investment caps help with prediction accuracy has not yet been determined conclusively. However, without an investment cap, commercial election stock markets may be dominated by a small number of traders. The existence of transaction costs for investing and trading in commercial election stock markets may also reduce their efficiency.\\n\\nSunstein (2006) argues that prediction markets are often more accurate than deliberating groups because prediction markets create strong incentives for revelation of privately held knowledge and succeed in aggregating widely dispersed information. Contrastingly, deliberating groups often amplify individual errors, and group members may fall victim to a bad cascade, either informational or reputational. Deliberators may emphasize shared information at the expense of uniquely held information.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electoral Palatinate", "body": "The County Palatine of the Rhine (), later the Electoral Palatinate (), was a historical territory of the Holy Roman Empire, a palatinate administered by a count palatine. Its rulers served as prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 1356.\\n\\nThe Electoral Palatinate was a much larger territory than what later became known as the Rhenish Palatinate (Rheinpfalz), on the left bank of the Rhine, and is now the modern region of the Palatinate in the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate and parts of the French region of Alsace (bailiwick of Seltz from 1418 to 1766). The Electoral Palatinate also included territory that lay on the east bank of the Rhine, containing the cities of Heidelberg and Mannheim.\\n\\nThe Palatinate emerged from the County Palatine of Lotharingia, which came into existence in the 10th century. During the 11th century, the Palatinate was dominated by the Ezzonian dynasty, who governed several counties on both banks of the Rhine. These territories were centered around Cologne-Bonn, but extended south to the Mosel and Nahe River. The southernmost point was near Alzey.\\n\\nFrom about 1085/1086, after the death of the last Ezzonian palatine count, Herman II of Lotharingia, the Palatinate lost its military importance in Lotharingia. The territorial authority of the count palatine was reduced to his counties along the Rhine, from then-on called County Palatine of the Rhine.\\n\\nThe first hereditary Count Palatine of the Rhine was Conrad of Hohenstaufen who was the younger brother of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The territories attached to this hereditary office started from those held by the Hohenstaufen in Franconia and Rhineland (other branches of the Hohenstaufens received Swabian lands, Franche-Comté, and so forth). Much of this was from their imperial ancestors, the Franconian emperor, and a part from Conrad's maternal ancestry, the Saarbrücken. These backgrounds explain the composition of Upper and Rhenish Palatinate in the inheritance centuries onwards.\\n\\nIn 1195, the Palatinate passed to the House of Welf through the marriage of Agnes, heir to the Staufen count. In the early 13th century, with the marriage of the Welf heiress Agnes, the territory fell to the Wittelsbach Dukes of Bavaria, who were also dukes and counts palatine of Bavaria. \\n\\nDuring a later division of territory among the heirs of Duke Louis II of Upper Bavaria in 1294, the elder branch of the Wittelsbachs came into possession of both the Rhenish Palatinate and the territories in the Bavarian \"Nordgau\" (Bavaria north of the Danube river) with the centre around the town of Amberg. As this region was politically connected to the Rhenish Palatinate, the name Upper Palatinate (Oberpfalz) became common from the early 16th century in contrast to the Lower Palatinate along the Rhine. \\n\\nWith the Treaty of Pavia in 1329, the emperor Louis IV, a son of Louis II, returned the Palatinate to his nephews Rudolf and Rupert.\\n\\nIn the Golden Bull of 1356, the Palatinate was recognized as one of the secular electorates, and given the hereditary offices of archsteward (, ) of the Empire and imperial vicar (Reichsverweser) of Franconia, Swabia, the Rhine, and southern Germany. From that time forth, the Count Palatine of the Rhine was usually known as the Elector Palatine (, ). \\n\\nDue to the practice of dividing territories among different branches of the family, by the early 16th century junior lines of the Palatine Wittelsbachs came to rule in Simmern, Kaiserslautern, and Zweibrücken in the Lower Palatinate, and in Neuburg and Sulzbach in the Upper Palatinate. The Elector Palatine, now based in Heidelberg, adopted Lutheranism in the 1530s and Calvinism in the 1550s.\\n\\nWhen the senior branch of the family died out in 1559, the Electorate passed to Frederick III of Simmern, a staunch Calvinist, and the Palatinate became one of the major centers of Calvinism in Europe, supporting Calvinist rebellions in both the Netherlands and France.\\n\\nIn 1619, Frederick V accepted the throne of Bohemia from the Bohemian estates. He was soon defeated by the forces of Emperor Ferdinand II at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, and Spanish and Bavarian troops soon occupied the Palatinate itself. Called \"the Winter King\", because his reign in Bohemia only lasted one winter. In 1623, Frederick was put under the ban of the Empire. Frederick V's territories and his position as Elector were transferred to the Duke of Bavaria, Maximilian I, of a distantly related branch of the House of Wittelsbach. Although technically Elector Palatine, he was known as the Elector of Bavaria. From 1648 he ruled in Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate alone, but retained all his Electoral dignities and the seniority of the Palatinate Electorate.\\n\\nBy the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Frederick V's son, Charles Louis was restored to the Lower Palatinate, and given a new electoral title, also called \"Elector Palatine\", but lower in precedence than the other electorates.\\n\\nIn 1685, the Simmern line died out, and the Palatinate was inherited by Philip William, Count Palatine of Neuburg (also Duke of Jülich and Berg), a Catholic.\\n\\nThe capital of the Palatinate moved from Heidelberg to Mannheim in 1720.\\n\\nIn 1742, the Palatinate was inherited by Duke Charles Theodore of Sulzbach. Charles Theodore also inherited the Electorate of Bavaria when its ruling line became extinct in 1777. The title and authority of Elector Palatine were subsumed into the Electorate of Bavaria, Charles Theodore and his heirs retaining only the single vote and precedence of the Bavarian elector. They continued to use the title \"Count Palatine of the Rhine\" (, ).\\n\\nCharles Theodore's heir, Maximilian Joseph, Duke of Zweibrücken (on the French border), brought all the Wittelsbach territories under a single rule in 1799. The Palatinate was dissolved in the Wars of the French Revolution. First, its left bank territories were occupied, and then annexed, by France starting in 1795; then, in 1803, its right bank territories were taken by the Margrave of Baden. The Rhenish Palatinate, as a distinct territory, disappeared. In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was abolished, and all the rights and responsibilities of the electors with it. \\n\\nIn 1806, Baden was raised to a grand duchy and parts of the former Palatinate including Mannheim became part of the new grand duchy. At the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and 1815, the left-bank Palatinate—enlarged by other regions such as the former Bishopric of Speyer—was returned to the Wittelsbachs and became a formal part of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816 and after this time, it was this region that was principally known as the Palatinate. The area remained a part of Bavaria until after the Second World War, when it was separated and became a part of the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate, along with former left bank territories of Prussia and Hesse-Darmstadt.\\n\\nthumbIn 1156 Conrad of Hohenstaufen, brother of emperor Frederick Barbarossa became count palatinate. The old coat of arms of the House of Hohenstaufen, the single lion, became coat of arms of the palatinate. By marriage, the Palatinate's arms also became quartered with those of Welf and later Wittelsbach. The arms of Bavaria were also used with reference to the elector's holdings in Bavaria. This was extended to quartering of the lion and the Bavarian Arms upon the ascension of Maximilian I to the position of elector of the Palatinate in 1623, used concurrently with the arms shown. The orb represented their position as Arch-Steward of the Holy Roman Empire.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electrical Cardiometry", "body": "Electrical Cardiometry is a method based on the model of Electrical Velocimetry, and non-invasively measures stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and other hemodynamic parameters through the use of 4 surface ECG electrodes. Electrical Cardiometry is a method trademarked by Cardiotronic, Inc., and is U.S. FDA approved for use on adults, children, and neonates. thumb\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe measured bioimpedance over time can be expressed as the superposition of three components:\\n\\nwhere Z is the quasi-static portion of the electrical impedance (base impedance), ΔZ are the changes of impedance due to the respiratory cycle, and ΔZ are the changes of impedance due to the cardiac cycle. ΔZ is considered an artifact akin to the estimation of stroke volume and is therefore suppressed. Exclusion of derived volumetric data may diminish the overall product. \\n\\nThe timely measurement of ΔZ (dZ(t)) reveals a waveform with shape similar to an arterial pressure waveform. The calculated first time derivative of dZ(t) is the  waveform, which contains landmarks that allow determination of left-ventricular ejection time (LVET) and peak aortic blood acceleration. The peak aortic blood acceleration occurs at the steepest slope of the dZ(t) waveform, and at the peak of the  waveform.\\n\\nElectrical Velocimetry (EV) is the model which Electrical Cardiometry is based. EV is based on the fact that the conductivity of the blood in the aorta changes during the cardiac cycle. EV was developed by Dr. Bernstein and Dr. Osypka in 2001, as a new model for interperating the bioimpedance signals of the thorax.\\n\\nthumbPrior to opening of the aortic valve, the red blood cells (erythrocytes) assume a random orientation (there is no blood flow in the aorta). When the electric current is applied from the outer electrodes, the current must circumference these red blood cells, therefore resulting in a higher voltage measurement, and thus, a lower conductivity. Shortly after aortic valve opening, the pulsatile blood flow forces the red blood cells to align in parallel with the blood flow. When the electric current is then applied, it is able to easily pass the red blood cells in the aorta resulting in a lower voltage, and thus, a higher conductivity. The change from random orientation to alignment of red blood cells upon opening of aortic valve generates a characteristic steep increase of conductivity or dZ(t) (corresponding to a steep decrease of impedance) – beat to beat.\\n\\nThe model considers the peak amplitude of  divided by the base impedance Z as an index for peak aortic acceleration, and as an index of contractility of the heart, or ICON. The general equation for estimating stroke volume by means of thoracic electrical bioimpedance calculates the product of a patient constant C (in ml), the mean blood velocity index  (measured in s during flow time, and FT (flow time measured in s):\\n\\nThe model of Electrical Velocimetry derives the mean blood velocity index  from the measured index for peak aortic acceleration ICON. The higher the mean blood velocity during flow time, the more SV the left ventricle ejects. The 'volume of electrically participating tissue' (V) is used as the patient constant. The V is derived primarily from the body mass.\\n\\nImpedance cardiography is a method of non-invasively monitoring hemodynamics, through the use of 4 dual sensors placed on the neck and chest. Both Impedance cardiography and Electrical Cardiometry derive SV and CO from measurements of TEB, but the underlying model is what differs. The Impedance Cardiography model contributes the rapid change of bioimpedance which occurs shortly after aortic valve opening to the expansion of the compliant ascending aorta, assuming that more blood volume temporarily stored in the ascending aorta contributes to a decrease in bioimpedance (or an increase in conductity of the thorax). The underlying model never proved accurate in patients with small cardiac outputs, hence it was never U.S. FDA approved for use in children or neonates.\\n\\nThe electrical and impedance signals are processed, and then utilized to measure and calculate hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output, stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, thoracic fluid index, ICON (index of contractility), and systolic time ratio. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electromagnetic propulsion", "body": "Electromagnetic propulsion (EMP), is the principle of accelerating an object by the utilization of a flowing electrical current and magnetic fields. The electrical current is used to either create an opposing magnetic field, or to charge a fluid, which can then be repelled. It is well known that when a current flows through a conductor in a magnetic field, an electromagnetic force known as a Lorentz force, pushes the conductor in a direction perpendicular to the conductor and the magnetic field. This repulsing force is what causes propulsion in a system designed to take advantage of the phenomenon. The term electromagnetic propulsion (EMP) can be described by its individual components: electromagnetic- using electricity to create a magnetic field (electromagnetism), and propulsion- the process of propelling something. One key difference between EMP and propulsion achieved by electric motors is that the electrical energy used for EMP is not used to produce rotational energy for motion; though both use magnetic fields and a flowing electrical current. \\n\\nThe science of electromagnetic propulsion does not have origins with any one individual and has applications in many different fields. The thought of using magnets for propulsion continues to this day and has been dreamed of since at least 1897 when John Munro published his fictional story \"A Trip to Venus\". Current applications can be seen in maglev trains and military railgun. Other applications that remain not widely used or still in development include micro-thrusters for low orbiting satellites and seawater thrusters for ships and submarines.\\n\\nOne of the first recorded discoveries regarding electromagnetic propulsion was in 1889 when Professor Elihu Thomson made public his work with electromagnetic waves and alternating currents. A few years later Emile Bachelet proposed the idea of a metal carriage levitated in air above the rails in a modern railway, which he showcased in the early 1890s. In the 1960s Eric Roberts Laithwaite developed the linear induction motor, which built upon these principles and introduced the first practical application of electromagnetic propulsion. In 1966 James R. Powell and Gordon Danby patented the superconducting maglev transportation system, and after this engineers around the world raced to create the first high speed rail. From 1984-1995 the first commercial automated maglev system ran in Birmingham. It was a low speed Maglev shuttle that ran from the Birmingham International Airport to the Birmingham International Railway System.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nElectromagnetic propulsion is utilized in transportation systems to minimize friction and maximize speed over long distances. This has mainly been implemented in high-speed rail systems that use a linear induction motor to power trains by magnetic currents. It has also been utilized in theme parks to create high-speed roller coaster and water rides. \\t\\n\\nMaglev: \\n\\n\\tIn a maglev train the primary coil assembly lies below the reaction plate. There is a 1–10 cm (0.39-3.93 inch) air gap between that eliminates friction, allowing for speeds up to 500 km/h (310 mph). An alternating electric current is supplied to the coils, which creates a change in polarity of the magnetic field. This pulls the train forward from the front, and thrusts the train forward from the back.\\tA typical Maglev train costs three cents per passenger mile, or seven cents per ton mile (not including construction costs). This compares to 15 cents per passenger miles for travel by plane and 30 cents for ton mile for travel by intercity trucks. Maglev tracks have high longevity due to minimal friction and an even distribution of weight. Most last for at least 50 years and require little maintenance during this time. Maglev trains are promoted for their energy efficiency since they run on electricity, which can be produced by coal, nuclear, hydro, fusion, wind or solar power without requiring oil. On average most trains travel 483 km/h (300 mph) and use 0.4 megajoules per passenger mile. Using a 20 mi/gallon car with 1.8 people as a comparison, travel by car is typically 97 khp (60 mph) and uses 4 megajoules per passenger mile. Along with this there are no carbon dioxide emissions and the running of the train is significantly quieter than other trains, trucks or airplanes. \\n\\nAssembly: Linear Induction Motor\\tA linear induction motor consists of two parts: the primary coil assembly and the reaction plate. The primary coil assembly consists of phase windings surrounded by steel laminations, and includes a thermal sensor within a thermal epoxy. The reaction plate consists of a 3.2 mm (0.125 inch) thick aluminum or copper plate bonded to a 6.4 mm (0.25 inch) thick cold rolled steel sheet. There is an air gap between these two parts that creates the frictionless property an electromagnetic propulsion system encompasses.\\tFunctioning of a linear induction motor begins with an AC force that is supplied to the coil windings within the primary coil assembly. This creates a traveling magnetic field that induces a current in the reaction plate, which then creates its own magnetic field. The magnetic fields in the primary coil assembly and reaction plate alternate, which generates force and direct linear motion.\\n\\nThere are multiple applications for EMP technologies in the field of aerospace. Many of these applications are conceptual as of now, however, there are also several applications that range from near term to next century. One of such applications is the use of EMP to control fine adjustments of orbiting satellites. One of these particular systems is based on the direct interactions of the vehicle's own electromagnetic field and the magnetic field of the earth. The thrust force may be thought of as an electrodynamic force of interaction of the electric current inside its conductors with the applied natural field of the earth. To attain a greater force of interaction, the magnetic field must be propogated further from the flight craft. The advantages of such systems is the very precise and instantaneous control over the thrust force. In addition, the expected electrical efficiencies are far greater than those of current chemical rockets that attain propulsion through the intermediate use of heat; this results in low efficiencies and large amounts of gaseous pollutants. The electrical energy in the coil of the EMP system is translated to potential and kinetic energy through direct energy conversion. This results in the system having the same high efficiencies as other electrical machines while excluding the ejection of any substance into the environment.\\n\\nThe current thrust-to mass ratios of these systems are relatively low. Nevertheless, since they do not require propulsive mass, the vehicle mass is constant. Also, the thrust can be continuous with relatively low electric consumption. The biggest limitation would be mainly the electrical conductance of materials to produce the necessary values of the current in the propulsion system.\\n\\nEMP and its applications for seagoing ships and submarines have been investigated since at least 1958 when Warren Rice filled a patent explaining the technology . The technology described by Rice considered charging the hull of the vessel itself. The design was later refined by allowing the water to flow through thrusters as described in a later patent by James Meng . The arrangement consists of a water channel open at both ends extending longitudinally through or attached to the ship, a means for producing magnetic field throughout the water channel, electrode at each side of the channel and source of power to send direct current through the channel at right angles to magnetic flux in accordance with Lorentz force.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electromagnetic weapon", "body": "Electromagnetic weapons are a type of directed energy weapon which use electromagnetic radiation to deliver heat, mechanical, or electrical energy to a target to cause various, sometimes very subtle, effects. They can be used against humans, electronic equipment, and military targets generally, depending on the technology.\\n\\nWhen used against equipment, directed electromagnetic energy weapons can operate similarly to omnidirectional electromagnetic pulse (EMP) devices, by inducing destructive voltage within electronic wiring. The difference is that they are directional and can be focused on a specific target using a parabolic reflector. Faraday cage may be used to provide protection from most directed and undirected EMP effects.\\n\\nWhen used against humans electromagnetic weapons can have dramatic effects, such as the intense burning sensation caused by Raytheon's Active Denial system, or more subtle effects such as the creation - at a distance - of a sense of uneasiness or dread in an individual or a group of people. Three significant military advantages of such weapons are: (1) that the individual or group of people would not necessarily realize that they were being targeted by such a device;(2) microwave radiation, like other radio frequency radiation, can easily penetrate most common building materials; and (3) with specialized antennas the radiation can be focused on either an individual or a large area such as a city.\\n\\nPotential military uses for such weapons include (1) the capability to influence an enemy force (or population) to flee - by imposing on them a sense of impending disaster - rather than fight; (2) the ability to convince a captured enemy combatant or combatants that the great sense of well-being which seemed to accompany their being even slightly cooperative was much more desirable than the overwhelming sense of dread associated with their being uncooperative; or (3) the capability to persuade an enemy - or the close comrades of that enemy - that the enemy - who hears voices or strange noises that no one else can hear - is going crazy and is not to be taken seriously or trusted. Such feelings, voices, and strange noises can be directed at the enemy with some precision by specialized microwave radiation antennas. \\n\\nHigh-energy radio frequency weapons (HERF) or high-power radio frequency weapons (HPRF) use high intensity radio waves to disrupt electronics.\\n\\nHigh and low power, Pulsed Microwave devices use low-frequency microwave radiation which can be made to closely mimic and interact with normal human brain waves having similar amplitudes and frequencies. See Microwave auditory effect.\\n\\nIn the United States of America, the University of Texas-Austin Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT) conducts basic research to advance electrodynamics and hypervelocity physics related to electromagnetic weapons.\\n\\nGenerally considered non-lethal, electromagnetic weapons can, under the right conditions or in the wrong hands, pose health threats to humans. Non-lethal weapons can be harmful if not deadly.\\n\\nSome common bio-effects of electromagnetic weapons include effects to the human central nervous system resulting in physical pain, difficulty breathing, vertigo, nausea, disorientation, or other systemic discomfort. Such weapons not directly considered lethal can cause cumulative damage to the human body.\\n\\nMicrowave pulses can affect the epidermis (skin) and dermis, the thick sensitive layer of skin and connective tissue beneath the epidermis that contains blood, lymph vessel, sweat gland, and nerve endings, generating a burning sensation or actual burn from as far as 700 meters.\\n\\nProject Pandora, conducted by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), included externally induced auditory input from pulsed microwave audiograms of words or sounds which create the effect of hearing voices or noises that are not a part of the recipient's own thought processes. Although in a very quiet environment, the test subject would clearly hear the words or sounds whether or not the person was wearing ear protection such as ear plugs.\\n\\nDirected energy weapons such as Boeing’s Airborne Laser, a chemical laser which has been mounted in a 747 jet is reportedly able to destroy incoming missiles by heating and warping the thin pressurized skin typical of such missiles.\\n\\nElectromagnetic weapons, including high power microwaves, were used during the Gulf War to disrupt and destroy the enemy's electronic systems and may have been used for other purposes.

A large voltage between the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons. A repulsive ring placed between them focuses the electrons onto a small spot on the anode at the expense of a lower extraction field strength on the cathode surface. Often at this spot is a hole so that the electrons that pass through the anode form a collimated beam and finally reach a second anode called a collector. This arrangement is similar to an Einzel lens.\\n\\nAn ion gun consists of a cylinder where gas enters from one end face, undergoes electron bombardment from the side walls, and is subjected to an extraction voltage from the other end face. The entire cage has the role of the cathode; the extractor acts as the anode, and an unnamed ring takes the role of the Wehnelt cylinder.\\n\\nMost color cathode ray tubes — such as those used in color television — incorporate three electron guns, each one producing a different stream of electrons. Each stream travels through a shadow mask where the electrons will impinge upon either a red, green or blue phosphor to light up a color pixel on the screen. The resultant color that is seen by the viewer will be a combination of these three primary color.\\n\\nAn electron gun can be used to ionize particles by adding or removing electrons from an atom. This technology is sometimes used in mass spectrometry in a process called electron ionization to ionize vaporized or gaseous particles.\\n\\n"}

The resistance generated varies depending on the light striking at his surface. A high intensity of light incident on the surface will cause a lower resistance, by contrast with a lower intensity of light will cause higher resistance. It can be found in laser printers, which bridges the gap between the laser beam to the core of the drum coater.In addition, modulating the laser intensity can be controlled with great precision the tone of the image that will ultimately be printed.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nPhotodiode is a semiconductor sensitive to visible or infrared light depending on their manufacturing equipment. The diodes have a normal direction of current flow, which is called direct current polarization. Therefore, the diode electric current passes and almost not allowed on the reverse: this is the basis of the operation of a diode. On the other hand the photodiode actual current (which varies with changes of light) is circulating in opposite direction allowed by the junction of the diode. This will cause an increasing in the current flow when the diode is excited by light. An example of application of photodiode is the remote control of a television. The controller sends an infrared signal and the photodiode captures\\n\\nA phototransistor is a transistor sensitive to light, usually infrared. The phototransistor is more sensitive than the photodiode due to the gain of the transistor. The most notable difference in the structure of a phototransistor, the phototransistor is the capsule, which is transparent or fully transparent, and is sensitive to light. The phototransistor conducts more or less current from the collector when it affects more or less light on their joints. As the photodiode, the phototransistor has a very short response time, so responds to fast light changes. Unlike the photodiode, the phototransistor gives much greater power variations due to an amplification that the photodiode does not have. There are two versions of phototransistors: transmission and reflections. The transistors can be used in proximity sensors,punched cards, tape drives.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electronic flight bag", "body": "Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) is an electronic information management device that helps flight crew perform flight management tasks more easily and efficiently with less paper. It is a general purpose computing platform intended to reduce, or replace, paper-based reference material often found in the Pilot's carry-on Flight Bag, including the Aircraft Operating Manual, Flight Crew Operating Manual, and Navigational Charts (including moving map for air and ground operations). In addition, the EFB can host purpose-built software applications to automate other functions normally conducted by hand, such as performance take-off calculations. \\n\\nThe EFB gets its name from the traditional pilot's Flight Bag, which is typically a heavy (up to 40 lb/18 kg or more) documents bag that pilots carry to the cockpit. The Electronic Flight Bag is the replacement of those documents in a digital format. EFB weights are typically 1 to 5 pounds (0.5 to 2.2 kg), about the same as a laptop computer, and a fraction of the weight and volume of the paper publications. There are numerous benefits for using an EFB but specific benefits vary depending on the size of the operation, type of applications used, the existing content management and distribution system, the type of applications deployed. Some common benefits include: weight savings by replacing the traditional flight bag, reduced medical claims from handling traditional flight bags, reduced cost, and increased efficiency by reducing or eliminating paper processes. There are also claims of increased safety and reducing pilot workload.\\n\\nAccording to the FAA's Advisory Circular (AC No. 120-76A), an Electronic Flight Bag is an electronic display system intended primarily for cockpit/flightdeck or cabin use. \\n\\nThere are also militarized variants, with secure data storage, night vision goggle compatible lighting, environmental hardening, and military specific applications and data.\\n\\nEFB devices can display a variety of aviation data or perform basic calculations (including performance data and fuel calculations.). In the past, some of these functions were traditionally accomplished using paper references or were based on data provided to the flight crew by an airline's \"flight dispatch\" crew. \\n\\nFor large and turbine aircraft, FAR 91.503 requires the presence of navigational charts on the airplane. If an operator's sole source of navigational chart information is contained on an EFB, the operator must demonstrate the EFB will continue to operate throughout a decompression event, and thereafter, regardless of altitude. The only way to achieve this capability is by using a Solid State Disk drive or a standard rotating mass drive in a sealed enclosure.\\n\\nThe earliest EFB precursors came from individual pilots in the early 1990s who used their personal laptops and common software (such as Spreadsheets and Word Processing applications) to perform such functions as weight & balance calculations and filling out operational forms. One of the earliest and broadest EFB implementations was in 1991 when FedEx deployed their Airport Performance Laptop Computer to carry out aircraft performance calculations on the aircraft (this was a commercial off-the-shelf computer and was considered portable). In addition, FedEx also began deploying Pilot Access Terminals on their airplane in the mid-1990s. These later devices were common laptops that used a certified docking station on the airplanes (to connect to power and data interfaces). In 1996, Aero Lloyd - a German carrier - introduced two laptops to compute the performance and access the documentation. The system called FMD (Flight Management Desktop) permits Aero Lloyd to remove all the documentation and RTOW in paper from the cockpit with the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (German Civil Aviation Authority) agreement. Other companies, including Southwest followed with \"carry-on\" performance computers, but they remained on the airplane as a practical matter. JetBlue took a different approach by converting all of its operations documents to electronic format and distributing them over a network to laptop computers that were issued to pilots (versus to the airplane). In 2006 MyTravel (a UK charter operation now merged with Thomas Cook airline) became the first to deploy an electronic tech log using GPRS communication, replacing the paper process. Thomas Cook has several years of successful operational experience of an EFB focussed on its UK fleet. \\n\\nAs personal computing technology became more compact and powerful, with extensive storage capabilities, these devices became capable of storing all the aeronautical charts for the entire world on a single three-pound (1.4 kg) computer, compared to the 80 lb (36 kg) of paper normally required for worldwide paper charts. New technologies such as real-time satellite weather and integration with GPS have further expanded the capabilities of Electronic Flight Bags. However, for large commercial airlines, the primary problem with EFB systems is not the hardware on the aircraft, but the means to reliably and efficiently distribute content updates to the airplane.\\n\\nWhile the adoption rate of the Electronic Flight Bag technology has been arguably slow among large scheduled air carriers, corporate operators have been rapidly deploying EFBs since 1999 due to reduced regulatory burden and easier cost justification.\\n\\nElectronic Flight Bags are divided into three hardware classes and three software types.\\n\\nEFB hardware classes include:\\n\\nThe EFB may host a wide array of applications, categorized in three software categories:\\n\\nNote: Type C applications are subject to airworthiness requirements, such as software certification. Type C applications must run on Class 3 EFB.\\n\\nAccording to the FAA, Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 EFB may act as a substitute for the paper manuals that pilots are otherwise required to carry with them. While Part 91 Operators (those not flying for hire, including private and corporate operators) can use their Pilot In Command (PIC) authority to approve the use of Class 1 and Class 2 EFBs (which are PEDs), operator with OpSpecs (Part 135, Part 121) must seek operational approval through the OpSpecs process.\\n\\nEFB users and installers should be aware of recent, clarified guidance for FAA Inspectors.

It is to her powerful uncle, Prince Mikhail Glinsky, that the family owned its distinction. In 1526, Vasili III resolved to divorce his barren wife, Solomoniya Saburova, and marry Elena. According to the chronicles, he chose Elena \"because of the beauty of her face and her young age.\"\\n\\nDespite strong opposition from the Russian Orthodox Church, the divorce was effected, and Elena gave birth to Ivan (future Ivan IV the Terrible) in 1530 and Yuri (future prince of Uglich) in 1532. It was later rumoured, that Elena brought witch from Finland and people of the Sami to help her conceive by the help of magic On his deathbed, Vasili III transferred his powers to Elena Glinskaya until his oldest son Ivan was mature enough to rule the country. The chronicle of those times do not provide any more or less precise information on Elena's legal status after Vasili's death. All that is known is that it could be defined as regency and that the boyar had to report to her. That is why the time between Vasili's death and her own demise in 1538 is called the reign of Elena.\\n\\nElena Glinskaya challenged the claims of her brothers-in-law, Yury of Dmitrov and Andrey of Staritsa. The struggle ended with their incarceration in 1534 and 1537, correspondingly. Elena's reign is also known for conflicts inside the government, caused by Elena's close association with a handsome young boyar named Ivan Feodorovich Ovchina-Telepnev-Obolensky and Metropolitan Daniel. In 1535, Elena conducted a currency reform, which resulted in introduction of a unified monetary system in the state. In foreign affairs, Glinskaya succeeded in signing an armistice with Lithuania in 1536, simultaneously neutralizing Sweden. She had a new defence wall constructed around Moscow, invited settlers from Lithuania, bought Russian prisonerns free and instigated messurers to protect travelers against street bandits. She is noted to have visited several convents \\n\\nElena died in 1538 at a relatively young age. Some historians believe that she was poisoned by the Shuisky, who usurped the power after her death. Recent investigations of the remains tend to support the thesis that Elena was poisoned.\\n\\n|-|-|-\\n\\n"}

Following his release, Tannenbaum was placed under arrest for his illegal actions that led up to his capture. He agreed to a plea-bargain and admitted to the reasons behind his travel to Dubai and described the details of his capture. In exchange, he was not tried for any crime and served no jail time.

{"title": "Eliminate Down", "body": " is a horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up for the Sega Mega Drive developed by Aprinet and published by Soft Vision in 1993. The game gave players immediate access to three directional-based weapons that could all be powered up as they fought strange alien enemies through eight, enormous levels. The game was never released outside of Japan and South Korea.\\n\\nReminiscent of Hellfire, the player’s space ship, the Steel Pyron, had three firing directional weapons all ready at their disposal: a forward firing blaster, a rear laser attack and diagonal, four-way firing bombs. The forward firing attack also had the Super Crash Shot, a small white straight-firing rocket, that with upgrades would change into a long white laser beam that could fire through foreground objects. Unlike Hellfire however, the game had no checkpoint system, though the game made the players restart a level once they lost all of their lives. Extends were set at every 100,000 points.\\n\\nThe weapons were upgradeable by collecting Power-Up icons; obtaining a certain number of Power-Ups would level-up the size and strength of the player’s weapons, but the weapons were upgradable to just 3 Levels. The only other defenses the players had was a shield pick-up called the Barrier that protected the ship for at least two hits. The A and C buttons allowed the player to switch among the three weapons. Players could also change the speed of the ship by pausing the game and adjusting the speed level on the pause screen.\\n\\nEliminate Down also had a mini-game that was playable at the main menu similar to Concentration where players had to find the right image under a certain time limit.\\n\\n"}

Her mother's brothers, John Mahon (b. 1746) and William Mahon (1753–1816), were noted clarinettist. Their sisters (Eliza's aunts), Mrs. Warton, Mrs. Ambrose, and Mrs. Second (1777–1805), were excellent vocalist. Mrs. Second sang at the Three Choirs Festival in 1795, and at the Royal Opera House in 1796. Her voice was of rare quality, and she \"sang up to F in alt with ease\" (Parke).\\n\\nEliza Munday became a pupil of John James Ashley. On 4 March 1803 she made her first appearance in oratorio at Covent Garden, Miss Stephens having at that period the first place as a singer. The young Munday, gifted with a voice of beautiful tone, a charming manner, and a face \"of dazzling fairness,\" obtained immediate success; but her attempt to embellish her solo singing with inappropriate tricks was condemned by critics. \\n\\nAfter acquiring further experience Eliza Munday learnt to employ her executive powers more judiciously. She married, at Liverpool on 11 Feb. 1806, James Salmon, organist of St. Peter's, Liverpool, whose father, James Salmon the elder (d. 1827), was lay clerk of St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and whose brother William (1789–1858), after holding the same position, was lay clerk of Westminster and taught singing. \\n\\nIn 1813 her husband enlisted and went to the West Indies with his regiment, where he died. Mrs. Salmon sang constantly at the Three Choirs Festivals from 1812 until 1824, and was soon deemed indispensable at oratorios and concerts in London. So numerous were her engagements that she had been known, in those days of difficult journeys, to travel some four hundred miles in six days, appearing at the large towns on the way. Her professional income during 1823 is said to have reached 5,000l. Suddenly, in a moment it was even said, during an Ancient music concert at the beginning of May 1825, Mrs. Salmon's voice collapsed. Her husband died before her voice failed. During her widowhood she sought for pupils, but in vain. She married for a second time a clergyman named Hinde, who died about 1840, leaving her destitute. After several years of poverty she died, aged 62, at 33 King's Road, Chelsea, on 5 June 1849.\\n\\nThe magic of Mrs. Salmon's voice lay in its tone. It was likened to that of musical glasses, and Henry Phillips wrote that when Thomas Lindsay Willman, the clarinettist, accompanied Mrs. Salmon, it was difficult at times to distinguish the voice from the instrument. But Mrs. Salmon was no musician, although perfectly drilled into everything the orchestra then required. She gave no character to anything she sang.\\n\\n"}

Eliza Stewart was one of the charter members.\\n\\nShortly after that, she met Stephen Boyd, a machinist in the Union Pacific car repair shops who had come to Laramie before the first train arrived in 1868. Boyd, born in Canada, came to the United States and settled along the South Platte River near Denver before hiring on to the Union Pacific. They married July 21, 1870, in Cheyenne.\\n\\nBefore her marriage, however, Stewart received the call to serve on the grand jury. The jury apparently did a credible job and Stewart’s unique position as the first woman selected gained some local fame. Nonetheless, when jury service ended, Stewart returned to teaching. \\n\\nTwo months after her marriage, Eliza was named to the organizing committee for the Wyoming Literary and Library Association. She helped draft the constitution and became a charter member of the organization, one of the first in Wyoming to promote libraries and the arts. She also continued to write poetry.\\n\\nIn August 1873, Eliza became the first woman in Wyoming (and probably the entire United States) to be nominated to run for the Territorial legislature. For unknown reasons, she declined nomination, withdrawing her name from the ballot. (Some 37 years later, Laramie resident Mary Bellamy became the first woman elected to the Wyoming legislature, none having served in that body during the territorial period).\\n\\nIn November 1883, she was a charter member of the newly organized Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Laramie, serving for many years as the organization’s secretary. In the Prohibition Party’s state convention in February 1888, she was selected as one of two Wyoming delegates to the party’s national convention, held that June in Indianapolis. \\n\\nIn the winter of 1912, she read a paper at ceremonies opening Whiting School in Laramie. Three weeks later, Eliza Stewart Boyd slipped in a patch of ice in front of her home and broke her hip. Within a week, the 79-year-old woman died.\\n\\nEliza Stewart Boyd is among the many women memorialized in the Women in the West Center, located on South Second Street, Laramie, just a couple of blocks from where Boyd spent much of her life.\\n\\n Boyd Papers, Wyoming State Archives, Cheyenne| WPA File #584, Wyoming State Archives, Cheyenne|Stephen Boyd obituary, ‘’Laramie Republican’’, Oct. 16, 1917|http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/RobertsHistory/Readings_chapter_4.htm\\n\\n"}

She was the daughter of Henry FitzHugh, 5th Baron Fitzhugh of Ravensworth and Lady Alice Neville, daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury and Alice Montagu, 5th Countess of Salisbury. Through her mother Alice, she descended from Edward III and was niece to Warwick, the 'Kingmaker'. Elizabeth had nine siblings, including Alice FitzHugh, Lady Fiennes and Henry, 6th Baron FitzHugh who married Elizabeth Burgh or Borough, daughter of Sir Thomas Borough, 1st Baron of Gainsborough and his wife Margaret De Ros. Their son, George FitzHugh, inherited the barony but after his death in 1513, the barony fell in abeyance between Elizabeth and her older sister Alice. This abeyance continues today between the two families.The current co-heirs to the barony are:\\n\\nElizabeth had an easy-going and pleasure-loving disposition. After her husband Sir William Parr died in 1483, Elizabeth, who was twenty three at the time, was left with four small children. As a widow, Elizabeth's life revolved around the court. Elizabeth served as lady-in-waiting to Richard III's queen, her cousin, Queen Anne Neville. Elizabeth would be second in a four generation span of family that would serve England's queens which started in 1483 with her mother, the redoubtable Anne Neville, Lady Fitzhugh. Her granddaughter, Anne Parr would continue the tradition by becoming lady-in-waiting to all six of Henry VIII's wives. Even Anne's sister, Catherine Parr, who would later become queen served in the household of the Princess Mary until she caught the eye of King Henry. \\n\\nElizabeth was lucky enough to remarry. After the overthrow of the House of York, Elizabeth made a dubious second marriage with a protege of Margaret Beaufort, Sir Nicholas Vaux, 1st Baron Vaux of Harrowden, which saved the family fortunes.\\n\\nElizabeth was married twice.

{"title": "Elizabeth Park (Michigan)", "body": "Elizabeth Park is a county park mostly located on an artificial island in the Detroit River in southern Wayne County, Michigan. The park is sometimes but rarely referred to as Slocum's Island — the historic name of the island on which the park is located. The park is located within the city limits of Trenton along Jefferson Avenue and just north of the Wayne County Bridge leading to Grosse Ile. Elizabeth Park is recognized as the first county park established in the state of Michigan.\\n\\nThe island is separated from the mainland by a narrow canal and is located on the western shores of the Detroit River in the Trenton Channel. The island itself is commonly referred to as Elizabeth Park, and the name Slocum's Island has largely fallen into disuse. While Elizabeth Park occupies the northern portion of the island, the portion south of Grosse Ile Parkway is occupied by the large Trenton Channel Power Plant.\\n\\nThe area was occupied by the Native American tribe the Wyandot for several centuries before Europeans arrived to colonize the area. The Wyandot settled the village of Maguagon along the banks of the Detroit River, which was the site of the minor Battle of Maguaga during the War of 1812. The area was soon settled as Truaxton in 1816 by Abram Caleb Truax, who was a French Major who decided to stay in the area after the war. In 1827, Lewis Cass, the governor of the Michigan Territory, organized Monguagon Township with Truax as the first township supervisor. As a part of the township, the area of Truaxton was renamed Trenton in 1847 and incorporated as a village in 1855.\\n\\nGiles Bryan Slocum (1808–1884), who was an early businessman and landowner, moved to Truaxton in 1834. He built Truaxton's first dock along the Detroit River in that summer. He would later manage docks up and down the Detroit River. He used his wealth to purchase three miles (4.8 km) of Truaxton's riverfront. He built his large estate on what he called Slocum's Island, which was partially separated from the mainland by his own constructed canal. Slocum married Sophia Truax (daughter of Abram Caleb Truax) in 1838, and she inherited his estate when he died in 1884. She continued to live on Slocum's Island with her only daughter, Elizabeth Nichols (née Slocum). Sophia Truax died in 1912, and Nichols then inherited the island.\\n\\nNichols died in 1919, and her children inherited the property. They donated the estate to the Wayne County Park Trustees in October 1919 on the condition that it be set aside as “Elizabeth Park” in honor of their mother. The Slocum estate, which consisted of 162 acres (65 ha), was given to the county and organized as Michigan's first county park. The donation was helpful in the creation of the Wayne County Park System, which had been hindered by a lack of funding to acquire their own properties. Though the new park system continued to have no funding afterward, the development of Elizabeth Park was made possible by financial support from the Michigan Department of Transportation, which improved the canal, created bridges connecting the island to the mainland, and built the road that circles the park.\\n\\nthumbIn 2003, the park underwent an over $1 million renovation of the crumbling Southshore Riverwalk, which was an original element of Elizabeth Park. The Northshore Riverwalk is also being improved at a cost of $1.2 million. This riverwalk is closer to the Trenton populace and is expected to draw in more visitors from the surrounding commercial district. The park includes a marina on the southern end near Grosse Ile Parkway. Fishing and boating remain very popular activities. Walking, skating, or fishing can be done from the 1,300 feet (396 m) of riverwalks, and the interior of the park contains hiking and cycling trail, a baseball field, skatepark, playground, and a large picnic area.\\n\\nThe unique pedestrian bridges that cross the canal and connect Elizabeth Park to the mainland were constructed in the early stages of the park's development. There are three walkway bridges — all named Elizabeth Park Walkway Bridge — at different locations. All three of these bridges are still structurally sound but are in desperate need of restoration. The only automobile bridge that crosses the canal is an arch bridge called the Elizabeth Drive Bridge on the north end of the park. The 59.7 ft (18.2 m) bridge was constructed in 1923 and retains most of its original features. However, like the pedestrian bridges, the Elizabeth Drive Bridge is in poor shape. The Michigan Historic Bridge Inventory lists the bridge as eligible for entry into the National Register of Historic Places.\\n\\nElizabeth Park is also mentioned for possible inclusion into the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, which is still in its preliminary stages of development. Since Elizabeth Park is owned by Wayne County, it is unsure at this time if the park would be included into the expanding refuge or if it would just include the surrounding waterways.\\n\\nthumbQuite the contrast to Elizabeth Park, the portion of Slocum's Island south of Grosse Ile Parkway is occupied by the large, coal-burning Trenton Channel Power Plant, which is owned and operated by DTE Energy. This property was not part of Giles Bryan Slocum's original property that was donated to the county in 1919 but has since been included as part of the island when the original canal around Slocum's property was expanded southward. The Detroit Edison Company, a present-day subsidiary of DTE Energy, purchased the southern portion of the island and constructed the Trenton Channel Power Plant in 1949. Much of their property is on the mainland surrounding West Jefferson Avenue. The main building — the two smokestack power station — is the only portion located on what is now technically the southern portion of Slocum's Island.\\n\\nDespite its nature, the power plant works closely with environmental organizations to ensure the area is free of pollutants. For their efforts, the Trenton Channel Power Plant was awarded the Wildlife Habitat Council's Corporate Habitat of the Year award in 2004. DTE Energy regularly spreads crushed limestone along the banks of the Detroit River on Slocum's Island, because such an item provides a popular nesting habitat for native common terns. Common terns were once plentiful in the region before industrialism drove out all but a small number of them. Other birds, such as the bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and great blue herons also use the grounds for habitat.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ellimist", "body": "The Ellimist is a fictional character from the science fiction novel series Animorphs.\\n\\nThe Ellimist is an almost god-like being, displaying many reality warping powers, though it is stated several times that while he appears to be, he is not omnipotent. By standard values, the Ellimist is a force of good and his foe Crayak is a force of evil. The Ellimist's backstory is detailed in The Ellimist Chronicles. He frequently interferes in the Animorphs' lives, so as to help defeat Crayak. The Ellimist also uses the Animorphs' Chee friend, Erek King, in his endeavors. When he appears to the Animorphs, he tends to take the form of an old male humanoid with glowing blue skin, similar to the typical wizard or wiseman archetype; in this form he can communicate normally.\\n\\nBefore achieving through abnormal circumstances an almost god-like omnipotence and omnipresence, the Ellimist was originally a Ketran named Toomin. (On a sidenote, it is later revealed in this book that the Ketran had no concept of music.) Toomin could be best described as an average if not mediocre gamer. He frequently played a life simulation game - very popular among his people - which featured two species and gave the player the task of minutely modifying environmental and evolutionary aspects of the species and their planet, as to cause change over time. The game often resulted in the extinction of another, less-evolved species. His game name was \"the Ellimist\". \\n\\nAnother society of Ketrans on his planet made the mistake of broadcasting transmissions of the game into deep space, as part of an experiment with radio transmission. Unfortunately, they did not bother to include an explanation that the transmission were only games, and a race called the Capasin annihilated the Ketrans, believing that the Ketrans meddled with the development of other species. \\n\\nToomin escaped on an experimental spacecraft with the last of his species. These last Ketrans roamed throughout the galaxy, searching for a new homeworld. Toomin eventually became the de facto leader of the ship's crew. Ketrans are approximately the size of humans, but are adapted for flight in a thick atmosphere and low gravity, and this made their search for a suitable home very difficult. Some of the last Ketrans favored a plan of re-engineering themselves, so that their children would be born adapted for life on the surface of a higher-gravity planet, but this created controversy among many.\\n\\nThe Ketrans eventually came to a moon covered almost entirely with water, which they believed could have been favourable save for some vital characteristics that needed to be discerned. As they came close to the surface of the water in an effort to probe the moon, their craft was seized by the tentacle of a creature whose tentacled body covered the entire surface of the moon. It pulled the ship into the water, and there were no survivors save for Toomin.\\n\\nThe tentacled creature called itself \"Father\", and was at its core a huge parasitic sponge. However, it had the ability to access through its tentacles the brain matter of dead creatures, and use them itself. It therefore had the combined knowledge of every creature that had ever crashed onto the moon; the other members of the crew, although dead, still existed in the form of the data left on their brains. Toomin would interact with them metaphysically, knowing fully well that they were only shadows and that his friends and his beloved Aguella were actually dead. \\n\\nHowever, while the brains of the dead augmented its knowledge, it had limited creativity - Father was indeed a sponge. Father kept Toomin alive as an ever refreshing source of creativity, and interfaced with his brain to converse and play games with him - Father was lonely, and Toomin became its only friend. At first, Toomin lost every game he played with Father, as Father had perhaps countless of creatures' knowledge and memories to draw upon. Eventually, however, Toomin discovered the advantage he had over Father: his superior creativity or that is, the capacity to love. This allowed Toomin to best Father at every game they played, and eventually, to do to Father what Father had done to so many others: Toomin took over the brain of Father.\\n\\nToomin found the wreckage of all the crashed spacecrafts on the moon where it had been kept by Father, and used his now boundless knowledge and insight to build a spacecraft, integrated with his body, many times more advanced than any before or since; he experimented with spreading his existence across multiple ships, becoming thus unbound. While he pleaded Father to let him die during his existence with it, after conquering it he decided that instead of choosing death he would choose life and thus purpose: by taking the name of the Ellimist, he vowed that the genocide of the Ketrans would never again be repeated while he was there to stop it.\\n\\nThe Ellimist journeyed through the galaxy, ending wars with the vast power of his spacecraft-body, fostering peace, and essentially taking on the role of a deity for many of the planets he visited. Eventually, the Ellimist met Crayak, a seemingly irrational being who aimed to bring tyranny and death to the universe as a form of entertainment, and recreate it under its own perspective. When they met, the Ellimist could not comprehend what Crayak had done to many innocent planets in the galaxy - the Ellimist was aghast by Crayak's principle of life. They battled for centuries, using vast technological powers in their attempts to destroy each other. In the process, they annihilated hundreds of worlds. Losing motivation to continue fighting the Crayak, the Ellimist temporarily retreated to the Andalite home planet. \\n\\nHe copied his conscience and a limited and purified part of his knowledge to an Andalite body he created by thus effectively splitting his existence into two; a process which on the whole was to him humanizing and joyful after having had to confront the Crayak. He was lonely, dehumanized, and sought love and companionship. The Andalites at the time were not an advanced civilization but a primitive collection of tribes. He lived as an Andalite and started a family. By living on the planet, the Ellimist learned that the key of survival was to create as many offspring as possible; although so many die, with repeated efforts life could multiply faster than the Crayak could wipe them out. With a renewed vigor, the Ellimist fought the Crayak, creating the Pemalite, creators of the Chee, who spread quickly throughout the galaxy (until they were destroyed by Crayak's own creations, the Howlers). \\n\\nIn a final move, Crayak attacked the Ellimist, forcing him into a black hole. Instead of dying, the Ellimist became one with the fabric of space and time, transforming thus from a technological semi-deity into a metaphysical one. Moving a planet that Crayak was about to destroy, believed to be Earth dozens of millions of years before the present time, half a year in its rotation, he was able to save it. In the meantime, however, Crayak too had managed to somehow find a way into the fabric of space and time. They start conversing, and agree that fighting directly would prove to be mutually destructive, as it would cause immense damage to the fabric and likely destroy them both in the process. The Ellimist suggests that they could become passive observers and watch life unfold and evolve, but the Crayak replies that he would rather choose his own destruction over that. The Ellimist then invites him to join him in the final game, where they would pursue their own battle indirectly by using sentient beings as gamepieces, and the Crayak agrees.\\n\\nThe Ellimist created the Time Matrix, according to Andalite mythology (in The Andalite Chronicles, the Ellimist informs Elfangor that he indeed created the Time Matrix), which was essentially a time machine; however, The Ellimist Chronicles does not mention the Matrix at any point in the story. The Matrix was buried (on Earth, no less) by Elfangor.\\n\\nFirst appearing in #7: ''The Stranger'', the Ellimist - without explaining about Crayak or their game - offers the Animorphs a chance to save a remnant of humanity. The Ellimist claims that he cannot interfere in the Yeerk invasion, but that he can bring some humans---as well as animals, human accomplishments, etc.---to a kind of \"wildlife preserve\" much like Earth, thus allowing a portion of humanity to survive. He also shows them a future where Earth is completely conquered, and all the Animorphs dead or Controllers; Rachel's Yeerk is apparently on good terms with Visser Three- now promoted to Visser One- and Tobias was killed and eaten after the others were infested. This, however, was a ploy that allowed the Animorphs to find out information they needed to destroy the Kandrona; by \"breaking his own rules\"- in the form of allowing the Animorphs to discover the location of the Kandrona in their present by witnessing its presence in the future-, the Ellimist helped to deal a major blow to the Yeerks. (It was also hinted that this timeline was actually an alternate future rather than an actual future for the Animorphs' true timeline, as Rachel's Yeerk is confused by the presence of Ax and refers to six humans coming into the future, suggesting that she is from an alternate timeline where Ax was never rescued and/or another person was with the main Animorphs when they walked through the construction site.)\\n\\nThe Ellimist appeared again to Tobias in ''The Change'', and again, explained his desire to save a species from destruction---in this case, he had arranged to free a pair of Hork-Bajir-Controllers (Jara Hamee and Ket Halpak), and Tobias aids the alien pair in setting up a home that eventually becomes the Free Hork-Bajir colony. The Ellimist rewards Tobias by granting him a wish. Tobias does not truly make a wish, but tells the Ellimist that \"you know what I want\". Tobias, expecting to be made human again, is simply given his morphing powers back, as well as the ability to morph into his human body (the Ellimist sends him back in time to acquire his past self prior to the trip through the construction site). This shows that what Tobias truly wants, is to retain the independence he has as a hawk, while still being able to help his friends in a fight.\\n\\nIn The Attack, the Ellimist finally reveals the truth about Crayak to the Animorphs, and uses them to help save a race called the Iskoort from Crayak's Howlers. He makes an interesting comment in this book---that, when Crayak first saw Jake in #6: ''The Capture'', Crayak had seen that the Ellimist \"had touched\" Jake. As the Ellimist didn't appear until book 7, this implies (and Applegate confirmed on the Animorph website) that the Ellimist had \"known\" Jake before this point.\\n\\nThe eventual meaning of this comes out in Megamorphs #4: Back to Before, where Jake- tempted by Crayak's servant, Drode- wishes that the Animorphs had never found Elfangor, thus never acquired the morphing powers. This new reality, however- which was supposed to give the Yeerks an easy victory- broke down, as Cassie was able to tell that the world was not as it should be, driving the Animorphs- even when only human- on a course of action that culminated in Jake and Ax stealing a Blade ship and using it to destroy the Yeerk Pool while Cassie killed Visser Three with a Dracon beam. Here the Drode reveals (in the form of complaining) that the Animorphs were, in fact, not a random assortment who had found Elfangor but that they had been picked out by the Ellimist: Elfangor's son Tobias, his brother Aximili, Cassie- a kind of 'nexus point' who by her very nature would disrupt any attempt to replace the true reality with an alternate one-, and the son of Visser One's host (Marco)- as he put it, the Ellimist had \"stacked the deck\" with them for their specific abilities and positions. Any alternate timeline would collapse due to their specific involvement with the fight against the Yeerks.\\n\\nThe Ellimist had also meddled with the past, and caused Elfangor to go from being a human on Earth to an Andalite war-prince; this change was made in the timeline while allowing Tobias to continue to exist, thus preserving the Ellimist's plans.\\n\\nThe Ellimist makes his final appearance in the last Animorph book, The Beginning. There he appears to honor the dying Rachel, where he tells her the story written in The Ellimist Chronicles. He also tells her that she was a random choice to join the team but that her life mattered greatly to the fate of the world.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elmyr de Hory", "body": "thumb\\n\\nElmyr de Hory (born 'Hoffmann Elemér') (11 April 1911 – December 11, 1976) was a Hungarian-born painter and art forger who claimed to have sold over a thousand forgeries to reputable art galleries all over the world. His forgeries garnered much celebrity from a Clifford Irving book, Fake!, and from F for Fake (1974), a documentary essay film by Orson Welles.\\n\\nMost of the information regarding de Hory's early life comes from what he told American writer Clifford Irving, himself a fraudster, who wrote the first biography about him. Since Elmyr's success was reliant upon his skills of deception and invention, it would be difficult to take the facts that he told about his own life at face value, as Clifford Irving himself admitted. Elmyr claimed that he was born into an aristocratic family, that his father was an Austro-Hungarian ambassador and that his mother came from a family of banker. However, subsequent investigation has suggested that Elmyr's childhood was, more likely, of an ordinary, middle class variety. His parents left him to the care of various governesses and were divorced when Elmyr was sixteen. \\n\\nElmyr moved to Budapest, Hungary to study. At 18, he joined the Akademie Heinmann art school in Munich, Germany to study classical painting. In 1926 he moved to Paris, and enrolled in the Académie la Grande Chaumière, where he studied under Fernand Léger and became accustomed to fine living. \\n\\nShortly after his return to Hungary, he became involved with a British journalist and suspected spy. This friendship landed him in a Transylvania prison for political dissident in the Carpathian Mountains. During this time, de Hory befriended the prison camp officer by painting his portrait. Later, during the Second World War, de Hory was released. \\n\\nWithin a year, de Hory was back in jail, this time imprisoned in a German concentration camp for being both a Jew and a homosexual (while his homosexuality was proven over time, investigation into his past has shown the likelihood that Elmyr was not Jewish, but instead was christened as a Calvinist). He was severely beaten and was transferred to a Berlin prison hospital, where he escaped and later slipped back into Hungary. It was there he learned that his parents had been killed and their estate confiscated.With his remaining money de Hory bribe his way back into France, where he tried to earn his living by painting.\\n\\nOn arriving in Paris de Hory attempted to make an honest living as an artist, but soon discovered that he had an uncanny ability to copy the works of noted painters. So good were his copies that many of his friends believed them to be genuine; in 1946 de Hory sold a reproduction of a Picasso to a British friend who took it for an original. He began to sell his Picasso reproductions to art galleries, claiming that they were what remained of his family's estate. Galleries took the paintings and paid de Hory the equivalent of (USD) $100 to $400 (circa 1947 Dollars?) per painting. Elmyr was always unique among art forgers in that, rather than attempting to copy existing works by celebrated artists, he only painted original works in their style, which made the forgeries much harder to detect.\\n\\nThat same year de Hory formed a partnership with Jacques Chamberlin, who would later become his art dealer. They toured Europe and South America selling the forgeries until de Hory discovered that, although they were supposed to share the profits equally, Chamberlin had kept most of the money. He ended the relationship and resumed the tour alone. In 1947 de Hory visited the United States on a three-month visa and decided to stay there, moving between New York City and Los Angeles.\\n\\nOccasionally, throughout his career, de Hory attempted to stop making forgeries and create original artwork, but could never find a market for his work, always returning to the lucrative clandestine activity. De Hory eventually expanded his forgeries to include works by Matisse, Modigliani and Renoir. Because some of the galleries de Hory had sold his forgeries to were becoming suspicious, he began to use pseudonym, and to sell his work by mail order. Some of de Hory's many pseudonyms included Louis Cassou, Joseph Dory, Joseph Dory-Boutin, Elmyr Herzog, Elmyr Hoffman and E. Raynal.\\n\\nDuring the 1950s, de Hory settled in Miami, continuing to sell his forgeries through the mail and studying the styles and techniques of other master painters in order to imitate their works. In 1955 one of his Matisse forgeries was sold to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University; soon thereafter, authorities discovered it was a fake and launched an investigation.\\n\\nIn 1955 de Hory sold several forgeries to Chicago art dealer Joseph W. Faulkner, who later discovered they were fakes. Faulkner pressed charges against de Hory and initiated a federal lawsuit against him, alleging mail and telephone fraud. De Hory later moved to Mexico City, where he was briefly detained and questioned by the police, not for his artistic endeavors, but regarding his connection to a suspect in the murder of a British man, whom de Hory claimed he had never met. When the Mexican police attempted to extort money from him, de Hory hired a lawyer who also attempted to extort money from him, by charging exorbitant legal fees. de Hory paid the lawyer with one of his forgeries and returned to the USA.\\n\\nOn his return, de Hory discovered that his paintings were fetching fantastically high prices at several art galleries, and was incensed that the galleries had only paid him a fraction of what they thought the paintings were worth. Further compounding de Hory's plight was that the manner of his forgeries had become recognizable, forcing him to sell his fake lithograph door-to-door to make a living. While on a trip to Washington DC, de Hory began to suffer from depression and attempted suicide by overdose of sleeping pills. His stomach was pumped, and after a stay in the hospital, de Hory convalesced in New York City, helped by an enterprising young man, Fernand Legros, who eventually became de Hory's primary dealer. Their stormy association lasted until 1967.\\n\\nLegros accompanied de Hory back to Miami where he continued to regain his health. Imprudently taking Legros into his confidence, the other man quickly recognized an opportunity and importuned the artist to let him sell his work in exchange for a 40% cut of the profits, with Legros assuming all the risks inherent in the sale of forgeries. With Legros, de Hory again toured the United States. In time, Legros demanded his cut be increased to 50%, when, in reality, Legros was already keeping much of the profit. On one of these trips Legros met Real Lessard, a French-Canadian, who would later become his lover. The two had a volatile relationship, and in 1959 de Hory decided to leave the two and return to Europe.\\n\\nIn Paris, de Hory unexpectedly ran into Legros. De Hory revealed to him that some of his forgeries were still back in New York. Legros devised a plan to steal the paintings and sell them, making a name for himself and his art gallery in the process. Later that year, de Hory decided to resume his partnership with Legros. Legros and Lessard would continue to sell de Hory's work, and agreed to pay him a flat fee of $400 a month. \\n\\nIn 1962, de Hory moved to the Spanish island of Ibiza, while Legros and Lessard kept up the business of selling his paintings for large amounts of money from Paris. Many times they would forget to send de Hory his small monthly allowance. After several instances of this, Legros built de Hory a home in Ibiza to placate him.\\n\\nElmyr always denied that he had ever signed any of his forgeries with the name of the artist whom he was imitating. This is an important legal matter, since painting in the style of an artist is not a crime - only signing a painting with another artist's name makes it a forgery. This may be true, as Legros may have signed the paintings with the false names.\\n\\nIn 1964, now 58-years old, de Hory began to tire of the forgery business, and soon his work began to suffer. Consequently, many art experts began noticing that the paintings they were receiving were forgeries. Some of the galleries examining de Hory's work alerted Interpol, and the police were soon on the trail of Legros and Lessard. Legros sent de Hory to Australia for a year, to keep him out of the eye of the investigation. \\n\\nBy 1966, more of de Hory's paintings were being revealed as forgeries; one man in particular, Texas oil magnate Algur H. Meadows, to whom Legros had sold 56 forged paintings, was so outraged to learn that most of his collection was forgeries, that he demanded the arrest and prosecution of Legros. Angered, Legros decided to hide from the police at de Hory's house on Ibiza, where he asserted ownership, and threatened to evict de Hory. Coupled with this and with Legros' increasingly violent mood swings, de Hory decided to leave Ibiza. Legros and Lessard were apprehended soon thereafter, imprisoned on charges of check fraud. \\n\\nElmyr continued to elude the police for some time, but, tired of life in exile, decided to move back to Ibiza to accept his fate. In August 1968, a Spanish court convicted him of the crimes of homosexuality and of consorting with criminals, sentencing him to 2 months in prison. He was never directly charged with forgery, because the court could not prove that he had ever created any forgeries on Spanish soil. He was released in October 1968 and expelled from Spain.\\n\\nOne year following his release, de Hory returned to Ibiza, by then a celebrity. He told his story to Clifford Irving who wrote the biography: Fake! The Story of Elmyr de Hory the Greatest Art Forger of Our Time. Soon thereafter, Irving created his own forgery: a fake auto-biography of Howard Hughes. Elmyr appeared in several television interviews, and was featured with Irving in Orson Welles' free-form documentary, F for Fake (1974). In Welles' film, Elmyr questioned what it was that made his forgeries inferior to the actual paintings created by the artists he imitated, particularly since they had fooled so many experts, and were always appreciated when it was believed that they were genuine.\\n\\nDuring the early 1970s, de Hory again decided to try his hand at painting, hoping to exploit his new-found fame: this time, he would sell his own, original work. While he had gained some recognition in the art world he made little profit, and he soon learned that French authorities were attempting to extradite him to stand trial on fraud charges. This took quite some time, however, as Spain and France had no extradition treaty at that time.\\n\\nOn December 11, 1976, Elmyr de Hory's live-in bodyguard (part of Elmyr's self-created mythos was his belief that he had enemies who wished to murder him) and companion, Mark Forgy, informed him that the Spanish government had, after lengthy negotiation, agreed to turn Elmyr over to the French authorities. Shortly thereafter, Forgy found Elmyr near death in their home. He had taken an overdose of sleeping pill, and within minutes of being discovered, died in Forgy's arms. Clifford Irving has expressed doubts about Elmyr's death, claiming that he may have faked his own suicide in order to escape extradition, but Forgy has dismissed this theory.\\n\\nFollowing his death, de Hory's paintings became valuable collectibles. In fact, his paintings had become so popular that forged de Horys began to appear on the market.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Els Borst", "body": "Else (Els) Borst-Eilers (22 March 1932) is a former Dutch Politician, she led D66 in the 1998 election campaign and served as Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport for eight years, and the last four as Deputy Prime Minister. Before entering politics she had a career in medicine.\\n\\nBorst attended the Barlaeus Gymnasium of Amsterdam graduating in 1950. The same school was attended by People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) leader Frits Bolkestein, who was one class below her. Following graduation she studied medicine graduating in 1958. She took special courses on pediatric medicine and immunohaematology when she as assistant-physician at the \"Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis\" in Amsterdam. In 1965 she started writing her thesis, while working as a medical scientist at Utrecht University, researching immunohaematology. In 1972 she received her Ph.D. at the Universiteit van Amsterdam (University of Amsterdam) following research on the development and prevention of rhesus immunisation. In 1969 she was the head of the Bloodbank of the University Hospital of Utrecht, and in 1976 she became medical director of that hospital. In 1986 she left this position to become vice-chair of the Health Council, which she combined from 1992 with a position as professor in \"evaluating medical actions\" at the University of Amsterdam. In the Health Council she chaired the committees on immunisation, genetics and medical ethics. Borst held several other positions in the medical world: she was chairperson of the College for Blood Transfusion as well as of the Committee on Research in Medical Ethics.In 1968 she joined D66, and was active as a rank-and-file member. In 1976 for instance, when D66 had lost nearly all its members and performed particularly bad in the polls, Borst was a volunteer in the promotion and revitalization campaign of the party, led by Jan Terlouw.\\n\\nIn 1994 Borst became minister of Health for D66 in the First cabinet of Wim Kok. As a minister, Borst was known for two things, for introducing progressive legislation in medical ethics and for her attempts to reform the medical system to better cope with the aging population.\\n\\nIn 2001 she implemented a law legalizing Euthanasia in the Netherlands under certain extraordinary conditions, and only when extensive protocols had been followed by the physician, and subject to an obligation of full reporting to a governing body. The law (, law on the legal review of euthanasia and assisted suicide) is considered her most important contribution in polictics. \\n\\nIn other medical ethical question, she also showed her progressive standpoints:\\n\\nShe faced political problems preparing the Dutch medical system for the aging of the population. An important part of her reforms of the medical system was to integrate the health insurance system (which had a public and private part), achieving that all citizens would pay the same amount for the same coverage. Although her ministry's budget was drastically increased during this period, she still had to limit the budgets of the hospitals. This led to a problem of long waiting lists for simple medical procedures. From both the political left and the political right she was criticized for what was seen as her mismanagement of the medical system. Pim Fortuyn put it dramatically when in an Elsevier column he wrote that \"Borst is worse than bin Laden\", because she had caused more deaths than the September 11, 2001 attacks. \\n\\nIn the 1998 elections Borst succeeded Hans van Mierlo as lijsttrekker for D66. She was parachuted by the party's leadership in a press-conference where Van Mierlo announced her candidacy with the words: \"It has become a girl, and we call her Els.\" Words which were similar to those that parents use to announce the birth of their new born child. Although Borst lost the elections -her party lost ten of its twenty-four seats- she remained the ministry of Health, and became deputy-prime-minister. During the formation talks Borst served as fractievoorzitter of D66 for one week (7 May - 14 May 1998), and as formateur.\\n\\nAfter the parliamentary inquiry in the El Al Flight 1862 (Bijlmer Plane Crash), Borst faced a motion of no confidence in June 1999. The inquiry committee had concluded that Borst and her ministry of Health did not react well to the health problems of survivors of the disaster. The motion was rejected by parliament after an eighteen hour long debate.\\n\\nAfter a 2001 interview in the NRC Handelsblad Borst also faced another motion of no-confidence. In the interview she had said \"It has been done\" (Dutch: \"Het is volbracht\") on completing the law on euthanasia. Which according to the Bible are the last words of Jesus, on the cross. The orthodox Protestant parties ChristianUnion (ChristenUnie or CU) and Reformed Political Party (SGP), who had opposed euthanasia were insulted by this. Although the motion was not carried by parliament, Borst made her apologies for those words to parliament.\\n\\nDuring her ministry she became member of the Institute of Medicine in Washington and fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh.\\n\\nBefore the 2002 elections she retired from political life. On 8 February 2003 she became honorary member of D66. Borst still has many positions in public life, serving as member of the Remembrance of the Dead and Liberation Day Committees. She also holds many positions in the medical world, she is chairperson of the board of NIVEL (National Institute for Scientific Research in Medicine) and chairperson of the Federation of Dutch Cancer Patients Organizations and chair of the advisory board of the Brain Foundation of the Netherlands.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emanuel Goldberg", "body": "Emanuel Goldberg (Hebrew: עמנואל גולדברג) (born: 31 August 1881; died: 13 September 1970) was born in Moscow and moved first to Germany and later to Israel. He described himself as “a chemist by learning, physicist by calling, and a mechanic by birth.” He contributed a wide range of theoretic and practical advances relating to light and media and was the founding head of Zeiss Ikon, the famous photographic products company in Dresden, Germany. His inventions include microdot, the Kinamo movie camera, the Contax 35 mm camera, a very early search engine, and equipment for sensitometry.\\n\\nGoldberg was born in Moscow on 31 August 1881 (19 August 1881 in the Old Style, Julian calendar, sometimes given in error as 1 September) the son of Grigorii Ignat’evich Goldberg, a distinguished Colonel (Polkovnik) in the Tsar’s military medical corps and his wife Olga Moiseevna Grodsenka. Early interested in engineering, he studied Chemistry at the University of Moscow and at several German universities, and remained in Germany after 1904 to avoid antisemitism in Russia. In 1906 he received a Ph.D from the University of Leipzig for research at the Institute for Physical Chemistry, led by Wilhelm Ostwald on the kinetics of photochemical reactions. After a year as assistant to Adolf Miethe in the Photochemistry Laboratory at the Technical University in Charlottenburg, Berlin, he became head of the photographic department of the Royal Academy of Graphic Arts and Bookcraft, in Leipzig from 1907 to 1917.\\n\\nIn 1917 Goldberg was recruited by the Carl Zeiss Stiftung to become a director of its photographic products subsidiary Ica (Internationale Camera Aktien Gesellschaft) in Dresden where he introduced the spring-driven Kinamo movie camera. In 1926 a “Fusion” of four leading photographic firms (Contessa, Ernemann, Ica and Goerz) formed Zeiss Ikon under Goldberg’s leadership until he was kidnaped by Nazi thugs in 1933 and fled to Paris. After four years working for Zeiss subsidiaries in France, Goldberg moved to Palestine in 1937 where he established a laboratory, later called Goldberg Instruments, which became the Electro-Optical Industries (“El-Op”) in Rehovot. A photograph taken 1943 by John Phillips for Life Magazine shows Goldberg in his work shop in Palestine. He retired in 1960 but continued his research and died in Tel Aviv on 13 September 1970.\\n\\nGoldberg patented improved methods for electroplating zinc on iron in 1902 and published numerous technical papers on improved printing techniques, reducing moiré effects in half-tone printing, photoengraving and other topics. In 1910 he became well-known for am improved method for making neutral gelatin wedges (“Goldberg wedge”) that was widely used in sensitometry and the Densograph, an instrument that greatly reduced the labor required to measure the characteristic curves of photographic emulsion.\\n\\nAt Ica, foreseeing a growing market in amateur and semi-professional movies, he designed an extremely compact 35 mm movie camera, the Kinamo, introduced in 1921 with a spring motor attachment added in 1923 to allow flexible handheld filming. Goldberg made films of himself and his family as promotional shorts and, in 1927, a skiing drama, “Ein Sprung . . . Ein Traum.” The Kinamo was used by Joris Ivens and other avant-garde and documentary filmmakers in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\\n\\nIn 1925 Goldberg demonstrated and published a technique for making microdot (Mikrat nach Goldberg) at a resolution equivalent to the text 50 complete Bible per square inch. This invention has been widely attributed to a mythical “Professor Zapp” based on J. Edgar Hoover’s erroneous article in the April 1946 Readers Digest, probably a confusion with Kurt Zapp who trained German spies in microdot photography during the Second World War.\\n\\nAt Ica and Zeiss Ikon Goldberg was involved in many innovations and led the design of famous Contax 35 mm still camera.\\n\\nGoldberg was best known for his extensive studies in sensitometry summarized in his book Der Aufbau des photographisches Bildes (1922) and the “Goldberg Condition” (Goldberg Bedingung), a design principle for high quality reproduction in two stage, negative-positive photographic processes better known in English as “the gamma rule.”\\n\\nGoldberg and his former teacher and collaborator Robert Luther were instrumental in the acceptance at the International Congress of Photography in Dresden in 1931 of the widely adopted German national film speed DIN 4512. At the same Congress Goldberg introduced his “Statistical Machine,” a document search engine that used photoelectric cells and pattern recognition to search the metadata on rolls of microfilm documents (US patent 1,838,389, 29 December 1931). This technology was used in a variant form in 1938 by Vannevar Bush in his “microfilm rapid selector,” his “comparator” (for cryptanalysis), and was the technological basis for the imaginary Memex in Bush’s influential 1945 essay “As we may think.”\\n\\nIn Germany Goldberg was noted for his educational displays at exhibitions, served as consultant on aerial photography in the First World War, and was a consultant to the Carl Zeiss firm in Jena. In Palestine and later Israel he was deeply engaged as an advisory to both civilian and military spheres. The apprenticeship scheme that he introduced in Tel Aviv provided advanced technical skills to many who went on to develop the Israeli high tech industry.\\n\\nIn 1968, Goldberg was awarded the Israel Prize, in exact science. \\n\\nOn 28 June 1907 Goldberg married Sophie Posniak (28 August 1886 - 10 December 1968). They had a son, Herbert Goldberg (b. 20 November 1914) and a daughter Renate Eva, now Chava Gichon (b. 19 September 1922).\\n\\nIn 1990 Chava Gichon (Tel-Aviv) requested restitution of the property in the Oeserstraße 5 in Dresden, which Goldberg as director of Zeiss-Ikon had bought in 1927, but the real estate office did not approve an intended agreement with the owner at that time in August 1995.\\n\\n"}

During World War II he volunteered to join the Waffen SS and was posted to the 12th SS Panzer Division ''Hitlerjugend'' which was formed in 1943. \\n\\nLocated in France during the Normandy Invasion the Division was moved to the front near Caen, Dürr by now a Unterscharführer and Assault gun commander in the 4th (Heavy) Company, 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment.\\n\\nHe was awarded the Iron Cross II class on the 23 June and the Iron Cross I class the next day on the 24 June.\\n\\nThe Knight's Cross was for the action on the 26 June 1944. \\n\\nFor almost three hours Dürr and the 26th Panzergrenadiers had been subjected to a naval bombardment salvo after salvo landing in the line of main defense outside the village of Saint Manvieu and on the village itself. They had been awaiting a major offensive on the Carpiquet airfield and the Orne river. When the gunfire stopped they observed Sherman tank advancing onto their location. They broke through the positions and overran St. Manvieu and surrounded the Battalion command post in the park. They engaged the tank force with mortar fire and some of the tanks turned away, assuming that the forces in the park were much stronger and did not attempt to break through. Then a flamethrower tank set up at the entrance to the park, dominating the command post, and able to harass any movement. “That tank has to go”, the commander ordered. \\n\\nUnterscharführer Dürr had heard the order, he picked up a Panzerfaust and went out to scout the situation. It was difficult to get close to the tank as it was sitting in a position that dominated the terrain on all three sides. Unterscharführer Dürr jumped across the inner wall of the yard and ran straight at the tank and opened fire with the Panzerfaust which did not pierce the tanks armour. Dürr was wounded in the chest, but he ran back along the path he had come, picked up another Panzerfaust and ran up to the tank a second time. This time, since the distance was unfavorable, he aimed at the tracks. But again, Dürr was hit by machine gun fire. Crawling, he worked his way back and spotted a magnetic charge. For a third time, weak from his wounds, he jumped across the wall and ran, towards the tank. Paying no attention to the bullets he attached the charge to the tank and turned away when he heard a rumbling sound behind him as the charge dropped to the ground, with no regard for his own safety he picked up the charge and held it against the tank. When it exploded he fell to the ground paralyzed and wounded now in the legs.He was taken to rest in the command post and died four hours later.\\n\\nEmil Dürr was awarded a posthumous Knight's Cross in August 1944, and entered on the Honour Roll in September 1944. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emiliano R. Fernández", "body": "Emiliano R. Fernández was born on August 8, 1894, in Yvysunu, Guarambare, Paraguay. His parents were Silvestre Fernandez and Bernarda Rivarola.\\n\\nHe is the author of more than 2,000 poems. Even though we don’t know much about his childhood we can say that during his first years he lived in the town named Ysaty, where he attended the elementary school until the 5th grade.\\n\\nDuring the revolution of 1904, which took the Liberal Party, a traditional political group founded in 1887, to the power, he moved to Concepción, where later he made the military service.\\n\\nFrom the 20's, with a bohemian spirit he began to travel to all the points of Paraguay, writing his first poems which he would then recite or sing with his guitar: “Primavera” (I y II), “Trigueñita” y “Pyhare amaguype”, published in “Okara poty kue mi”, magazine of poetry and popular songs, edited for many years by the Trujillo family.He later wrote two of his most popular songs in an epic tone: “Che la reina” o “Ahama che china” and “Rojas Silva rekavo”.During the Chaco War, between Paraguay and Bolivia ( 1932–1935 ) he was a member of the Regimiento de Infanteria “13 Tuyutí”, as a soldier, writing his best poems between the pauses of the battles. He was wounded and moved to Asuncion. \\n\\nAs a soldier, in the battle of Nanawa, he reached the summit of value and sacrifice. During the international conflict, his poems reached all the distant points of the country, giving enthusiasm and conviction of victory, which later gave him the nickname of “Tirteo verde olivo”, an expression he owes to Mauricio Cardozo Ocampo. \\n\\nMore than 60 years later, whenever one of his songs is listened to, an inevitable patriotic emotion fills the hearts of his fellow citizens. The scholar and intellectual Carlos Villagra Marsal considers him the most popular poet in Paraguay. With his poems written in “jopara” (mixture of guarani and Spanish) he could get deep inside the soul of his people.\\n\\nOne of the curiosities in his immense work are the verses dedicated to the women who had sometime had a relation with him, and there weren’t few: his wife, Maria Belen Lugo, Leandra Paredes, Zulmita Leon, Mercedes Rojas, Catalina Vallejos, Dominga Jara, Eloisa Osorio, Otilia Riquelme, Marciana de la Vega, among many .\\n\\nHis last poem was dedicated to his nurse, Facunda Velásquez, a short time before dying.\\n\\nHe devoted himself to journalism for a few years, working in the “Semanario Guaraní” with Facundo Recalde. During his life he Publisher a small book named “Ka’aguy jary’i”, containing some of his more emblematic poems.\\n\\nIn 1950, the Guarani Association of Writers declared him the “national Glory”.\\n\\nEmilianore, as he was known, was a synthesis of the Paraguayan bohemian world. He was a traveler and a late sleeper, he lived for a while in Sapucai, then in Caballero, then in San Pedro, Puerto Casado, Puerto Pinasco, Rancho Carambola (Brazil), and besides being a musician and a poet, he was also known for various activities such as carpenter, scouts guide, and forest man. In one of the files of his many works in Carlos Casado, we can see together with the firing paper, the following recommendation:” he is not to be taken ever as a worker in this company because he likes to party too much.”\\n\\nHis extensive poetic work as well as musical incluyes, among others, the popular songs “Asunción del Paraguay”, “Las siete cabrillas”, “Adiós che paraje kue”, “La última letra”, “Siete notas musicales”, “Guavirá poty”, “Oda pasional”, “Tupasy del campo”, “Despierta mi Angelina”, “Che pochyma nendive”, “Nda che pochyi nendive”, “¿Porqué?”, “De lejos vengo”, “Tujami”, “Jagua rekove”, “Mboriahu memby”, “Reten pe pyhare”, “13 Tuyutí”, “Soldado guaraní”, “1º de Marzo”, “Ñesuhame”, “Nde keguype”, “Nde juru mbyte”, “Farra chui che kepe guare”.\\n\\nA short while before dying, he left a great message in his poem \"Mi pluma\": \"my pen is a girl, my flag and my heroin, en the fight her audacity and her courage never stops, she is the spear that touches sharply, very softly a sentinel of my life, faithful guardian of my honor. It is my bohemian pen, the country harmony, failed by teutons with a mean instinct; she is the victim of the hatred of those stingy souls, 'late scholars of show off state'\".\\n\\nThe historian Roberto A. Romero, among his biographers one of the main ones, refers about the circumstances of his death:” On November 3, 1948, at around 6 pm , Emiliano arrived to the store name “caracolito” of the neighborhood Loma Kavara”…There he was reached by a bullet from the shadows, who wounded him deeply…He had been ambushed. The author of the crime was taken. The musicians Ricardo Pereira , Federico Esmerdel and Carlos Vera took him to the Militar hospital…. That night he had a surgery by Dr Pedro de Felice. He stayed there for a few months…But he didn’t recover from his wounds …he died… after a long suffering, at around 4.25 on September 15, 1949.” On the fact of his death, “Okara poty kue mi” says: he died from a bad bullet.\\n\\nThe great Paraguayan poet Elvio Romero sang to him: “With a walking soul he went to rest on death, in the sad instant of his walking. He left on an errant night and left us his songs.”\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emilie Autumn", "body": "Emilie Autumn (born in Malibu, California, on September 22, 1979) is an American singer-songwriter, poet, and violin who is best known for her wide range of musical styles and her use of theatrics. She began learning the violin at the age of four and left regular school five years later with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist; she practiced up to nine hours a day and read a wide range of literature. Progressing to writing her own music and poetry, she went to the Colburn School of Performing Arts, and then Indiana University's Music Conservatory, which she left over issues regarding the relationship between classical music and the appearance of the performer. Through her own independent label Traitor Records, Autumn debuted with her classical album On a Day: Music for Violin & Continuo in 1997, followed by 2002's supernaturally themed album Enchant.\\n\\nAfter appearing in singer Courtney Love's backing band on her America's Sweetheart tour and returning to the United States, Autumn attempted suicide after having an abortion and was kept on suicide watch in a Los Angeles mental institution. After being released, she had her cell block number tattooed on her arm as a way of remembering what had happened to her. She released the 2006 album Opheliac with the German label Trisol Music Group. In 2007, she released Laced/Unlaced; the re-release of On a Day... appeared as Laced with songs on the electric violin as Unlaced. She later left Trisol to join New York-based The End Records in 2009 and release Opheliac  in the United States, where previously it had only been available as an import. Currently she is working on an album entitled Fight Like a Girl.\\n\\nAutumn draws influence for her music—the style of which she has alternatively labeled as \"Victoriandustrial\" and glam rock—from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era, with her main musical influence being the English violinist Nigel Kennedy. Her live performances, which she calls dinner theatre because of her practice of throwing tea and tea-time snacks offstage, make use of burlesque to counterbalance the morbid topics; Autumn incorporates theatrics with an all-female backing band called The Bloody Crumpets. Outspoken about living with bipolar disorder and her experience in a modern-day mental institution, she has written an autobiography, the 2009 The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls.\\n\\nthumbEmilie Autumn was born in Malibu, California, on September 22, 1979. According to Autumn, \"being surrounded by nature and sea had a lot to do with [her] development as a 'free spirit.' \" Her mother worked as a seamstress and Autumn claims she is descended from the Liddell family. A German circus performer, her father immigrated to America at the age of nine and ran away at age fourteen; Autumn claims that he suffered abuse from his father and a \"difficult and cruel upbringing\". He did not share a close relationship with his daughter. She also has a sister. While not musicians, her family enjoyed various genres of music.\\n\\nShe started learning the violin at four, something that helped her to cope with bipolar disorder—which caused her to experience drastic mood swings and auditory hallucination in the form of disembodied voices—and abuse that began when she was six years old. Autumn later admitted that she had \"absolutely no idea\" what a violin was at that time, remarking that \"I might have thought it was a kind of pony for all I know, but I don't remember being disappointed.\" Four years later, Autumn made her musical debut as a solo violinist, backed by an orchestra, and won a competition. At the age of nine,#tag:ref she left regular school with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist and later went to the Colburn School of Performing Arts. Growing up, she owned a large CD collection of \"violin concerto, symphonies, chamber music, opera, and a little jazz\". She began writing her own music and poetry at age thirteen or fourteen, though she never planned to sing any of her songs. At fourteen, she attended the Music Conservatory at Indiana University. After two years at the university, she left because she disagreed with the prevailing views on individuality and classical music.\\n\\nWhile convinced that she would only play violin, eighteen-year-old Autumn decided to sing on one of her songs as a way of demonstrating to a major music producer, who wanted to sign her on a label, how it should sound. She became unhappy with the changes done to her songs and decided to break away from the label and create her own independent record label, Traitor Records. Through it, she debuted with her 1997 classical album On a Day: Music for Violin & Continuo; the title is a reference to Shakespeare and the fact that the album took only a day to record. She also debuted with her poetry book Across The Sky & Other Poems in 2000, later re-released in 2005 as Your Sugar Sits Untouched with a music-accompanied audiobook. As part of a recording project, Autumn traveled to Chicago, Illinois, in 2001, but finally decided to stay because she enjoyed the public transportation system and music scene there. She released the 2001 extended play (EP) Chambermaid while finishing Enchant—she alternatively labeled the musical style on Chambermaid as \"fantasy rock\" and cabaret—and wrote the 2002 charity single \"By the Sword\" after the events of September 11, 2001. According to her, the song is about strength and not violence; the act of swearing by the sword represents \"an unbreakable promise to right a wrong, to stay true.\"\\n\\nthumbIn 2002, she released her concept album Enchant, which spanned multiple musical styles: \"new age, pop and trip-hop chamber music\". The theme of Enchant revolved around the supernatural realm and its effect on the modern-day world. Autumn labeled it as \"fantasy rock\", which dealt with \"dreams and stories and ghosts and faeries who'll bite your head off if you dare to touch them\". The faery-themed \"Enchant Puzzle\" appeared on the artwork of the album; her reward for the person who would solve it consisted of faery-related items. At the same time of Enchants release, Autumn had several side projects: Convent, a musical group for which she recorded all four voices; Ravensong, \"a classical baroque ensemble\" that she formed with friends in California; and The Jane Brooks Project, which she dedicated to the real-life, 16th-century Jane Brooks—a woman executed for witchcraft.\\n\\nOn the night of the Enchant release party, Autumn learned that Courtney Love had invited her to record an album, America's Sweetheart, and embark on the tour to promote it. Contributing violin and vocals to it, Autumn appeared together with Love's backing band The Chelsea on the 2004 tour. In 2004, she recorded violin and vocals for Billy Corgan's album The Future Embrace, and created the costumes for his music video. In retrospect, Autumn felt working with both artists and promoting their albums had \"stunted\" her musical career, and drug use that she had witnessed on Love's tour disgusted her. In September 2004, her father died from lung cancer, even though he had quit smoking twenty years earlier. Near the end of 2004, she was filmed for an appearance on an episode of HGTV's Crafters Coast to Coast, showing viewers how to create faery wings and sushi-styled soap—both products she sold in her online \"web design and couture fashion house\", WillowTech House. Later in 2005, she recorded vocals and violin for \"The Gates of Eternity\" from Attrition's 2008 album All Mine Enemys Whispers: The Story of Mary Ann Cotton, a concept album focusing on the Victorian serial killer Mary Ann Cotton. Autumn later protested the release of the song, claiming that it was unfinished, \"altered without her permission,\" and had been intended only as a possible collaboration with Martin Bowes.\\n\\nAutumn released the limited-edition EP Opheliac, a demo to her concept album of the same name, through her own label, Traitor Records; while the Opheliac EPs were being shipped, Autumn claimed that her offices had been robbed, causing the delay in the album release and the shipping of the EPs. In January 2006, she performed a song from the album, \"Misery Loves Company\", on the Chicago-based television station WGN, before the album's release by the German label Trisol Music Group in October 23 of the same year. She recorded Opheliac because \"it was the documentation of a completely life-changing and life-ending experience\". At one time, Autumn did have plans to film a music video for her song \"Liar\", which included \"bloody bathtubs\". Her favorite song on Opheliac is \"The Art of Suicide\" because she felt it was \"the most honest\" and \"most complete thing [she has] written.\"thumbShe released several more EPs and albums. November 2006 saw the release of the double feature EP Liar/Dead Is the New Alive, which featured remixes of songs from Opheliac and new material. Her March 2007 album, Laced/Unlaced, consisted of two discs: Laced, the re-release of On a Day..., and Unlaced, new songs for the electric violin. She decided to re-release On a Day as Laced because she \"felt that it made a nice contrast to the metal shredding fiddle album, \"Unlaced,\" and [...] loved that it was the perfect representation of \"then\" versus \"now.\" Five months later, she released A Bit O' This &amp; That: a compilation album of her cover, including songs from The Beatles and The Smiths, classical pieces, and her own songs. In 2008, she released 4 o'Clock, which contained remixes of songs from Opheliac, new songs, and a reading from her autobiography The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls.\\n\\nAutumn broke away from Trisol Music Group to join The End Records and re-release Opheliac in the United States on October 27, 2009; previously, it was only available there as an import. The re-release included extras such as pictures, bonus tracks, an excerpt from The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, and a video. In addition to appearing on Adult Swim cartoon Metalocalypse as a guest artist in 2006 and on the subsequent 2007 album The Dethalbum, Autumn collaborated with other musicians. She contributed backing vocals and violin to \"Dry\" by Die Warzau and made an appearance in the music video for \"Born Again\". She played violin on the song \"UR A WMN NOW\" from OTEP's 2009 album, Smash the Control Machine. Her track \"Organ Grinder\" from the 4 o'Clock EP appeared on the European edition of the Saw III soundtrack, while a remixed version of \"Dead Is The New Alive\" was on the international version of the Saw IV soundtrack.\\n\\nIn June 2010, Autumn released the acronym of her upcoming album, F.L.A.G., on Twitter, before revealing the full title in an interview as Fight Like A Girl. She explained the concept behind \"fighting like a girl\" as self-defense without honor or rules. Planned to be \"a bit more violent... bloodier [and]...a little more metal,\" Fight Like A Girl acts as a continuation of The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls and has the inmates fighting back against their abusers.\\n\\nthumbA classically trained musician, Autumn draws influence from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. She enjoys the works of Robert Browning, his wife Elizabeth, and Edgar Allan Poe. She incorporates sounds resembling Victorian machinery such as locomotives, which she noted was \"sort of a steampunk thing\". While a young Autumn cited Itzhak Perlman as an influence because of the happiness she believed he felt when he played, her main musical influence is Nigel Kennedy. She takes inspiration for her songs from her life experiences and mixes in \"layers and layers of references, connections, other stories and metaphor\".\\n\\nAutumn describes her music and style as \"Psychotic Vaudeville Burlesque.\" She alternatively labels her music and style as \"Victoriandustrial'\", a term she coined, and glam rock because of her use of glitter onstage. According to Autumn, her music \"wasn't meant to be cutesy\" and is labeled as industrial mainly because of her use of drums and yelling. Labeled as steampunk, neo-Victorian, and Industrial Gothic, her music encompasses a wide range of styles. The 2002 albumEnchant drew on \"new age chamber music, trip-hop baroque, and experimental space pop\" while the 2006 release Opheliac featured \"cabaret, electronic, symphonic, new age, and good ol' rock & roll (and heavy on the theatrical bombast).\"\\n\\nFor her live performances, which she calls dinner theatre because of her practice of throwing tea and tea-time snacks offstage, Autumn makes use of burlesque—\"a show that was mainly using humour and sexuality to make a mockery of things that were going on socially and politically\"—to counterbalance the morbid topics such as abuse and self-mutilation. She incorporates handmade costumes, fire tricks, theatrics, and a female backing band, The Bloody Crumpets: Naughty Veronica, Captain Maggot, The Blessed Contessa, Little Lucina, and the model Ulorin Vex. Her wish for the live shows is to be an \"anti-repression statement\" and empowerment.\\n\\nthumbIdentifying as an asexual, Autumn follows the vegan lifestyle. At the age of eleven, she went vegetarian after being unable to rationalize why she should eat farm animals but not her pet; in her late-teens, she turned vegan. She believes that there is a link between the treatment of women and animals in society. Additionally, Autumn has bipolar disorder and takes medication for it. Some of her songs—\"Manic Depression\", \"Swallow\", and \"Misery Loves Company\" from Opheliac—deal with living with the disorder. While she would \"prefer to not have it [...] and probably be a lot happier,\" she believes that it gives her a different perspective on life and plans to \"use it for all it’s worth so that [she is] not a victim of it.\" Autumn also keeps a ritual of drawing a heart on her cheek as a symbol of protection and reminder of her humanity. She cares for two pet rats, Sir Edward and Basil, and a cat, Fish, and endorses companies such as Manic Panic and Samson Tech. \\n\\nReturning from Courtney Love's 2004 tour, Autumn resumed working on her own career and became pregnant, although she had been on birth control. Terrified of childbirth and unwilling to pass on her bipolar disorder, she decided to have an abortion. Later, she attempted suicide, which caused her to be admitted to a Los Angeles mental institution and kept on suicide watch. On her experience there, she commented: \"No one tried to break me out or contact me, and I wasn’t allowed to call anyone. Now, I watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, and realise it’s actually a pretty accurate portrayal of a modern-day asylum.\"\\n\\nAfter being released, she had her cell block number tattooed on her arm as a way of remembering what happened to her and penned her autobiography, The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, which was published in December 2009. The release was delayed because some did not want it published. Based on her diary written in red crayon while institutionalized, the book incorporated talking rats and the diary of a fictional Victorian inmate named \"Emily\". Autumn explained that \"one of the main messages is\" that many of the patients were not insane and that the subject of mental illness remains misunderstood.\\n\\n"}

A while after that, he commented in his El Socialismo no es la violencia, ni el despojo, ni el reparto (\"Socialism Is Not Violence, Nor Plunder, Nor Redistribution\"): \\n\\nIn 1920, he demanded a Party agreement on its position towards the October Revolution and Bolshevism. In the 1921 Congress, the PS voted to join the Comintern, and turned itself into the Communist Party of Uruguay (PCU); Frugoni refused to adhere to the party line, and refounded the PS as a non-communist group. In the 1928 elections, the PCU obtained 3,911 votes, and the PS 2,931.\\n\\nHe became an opponent of authoritarian President Gabriel Terra in the 1930s, and was imprisoned, then exiled.

She was briefly a junior high school English teacher.\\n\\nEmily and Bill Harris arrived in Berkeley, California in 1973 from Bloomington, Indiana. They came with their friends Gary Atwood and Angela Atwood. They soon joined a leftwing group, one of whose activities was visiting prisoners in northern California. The Harrises made the acquaintance of an escaped prisoner, Donald DeFreeze. They joined the SLA, created by Mizmoon Soltysik, Nancy Perry, Joseph Remiro, Russ Little, Willie Wolfe, Angela Atwood, Theo Wheeler, and Camilla Hall. Emily Harris's nom de guerre was Yolanda. On November 6, the SLA committed its first public act, the assassination of popular Oakland, California school superintendent Marcus Foster. The SLA mistakenly thought that Foster was behind a plan to require student identification cards in Oakland high schools. Subsequently, they kidnapped Patty Hearst, the college student heir to the Hearst newspaper chain.\\n\\nEmily and Bill Harris took over the leadership of the SLA after six other SLA members died in a Los Angeles shootout with police and the house fire it triggered. After the fire, the Harrises spent over a year on the run with their victim, Patty Hearst and new members Kathleen Soliah, Josephine Soliah, Steven Soliah, Mike Bortin, Jim Kilgore, and Wendy Yoshimura. Hearst had since become an active participant in SLA crimes herself. Yoshimura, Patty's closest friend while underground, was a fugitive for her involvement with explosives that were stored in a garage she rented. During that year the SLA committed a string of crimes, including an April 21, 1975 robbery of Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California. During the robbery, 42-year old Myrna Opsahl was shotgunned to death. Opsahl was depositing a church collection at the time. Patty Hearst stated in her 1982 autobiography Every Secret Thing that Emily was the shooter. Hearst also stated that Harris said \"Oh, she's dead, but it doesn't really matter. She was a bourgeois pig anyway. Her husband is a doctor.\" Other SLA members had urged Harris not to bring the shotgun to the robbery, as it had accidentally gone off twice during preparations. \\n\\nThe Harrises were eventually arrested and served eight years in prison for the Hearst kidnapping. Imprisoned at the California Institution for Women at Frontera, California, Emily Harris spent the first half of her term in solitary confinement. Emily learned computer programming in prison.\\n\\nAfter her release from prison, Harris became a computer programmer and began a successful computer consulting company. She worked at MGM Studios until her second conviction. She divorced her husband and lived with another woman for many years in Los Angeles. Together they purchased a two-bedroom home in Altadena, California.\\n\\nFor over 25 years no one was charged in the Opsahl murder. The SLA wore wigs and masks during the Crocker Bank robbery, and left little evidence behind. However, with new forensics techniques, the FBI was eventually able to link shotgun pellets removed from Opsahl's body to shotgun shells found in an SLA hideout. Additional evidence mounted, and in 2002 Harris and three other SLA members were charged with the Opsahl murder. Harris's bail was set at one million US dollars, which her supporters quickly gathered.\\n\\nThree former SLA members who had been granted immunity - Hearst, Steven Soliah, and Wendy Yoshimura - were set to testify for the prosecution in the Opsahl case. \\n\\nFacing a possible conviction, Harris and the others pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. Harris was sentenced to eight additional years in prison; Bill Harris was sentenced to seven years and Kathleen Soliah and Michael Bortin were each sentenced to six years for their roles.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emily Robison", "body": "Emily Robison (born Emily Burns Erwin on August 16, 1972) is an American songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist, and a founding member of the female country band the Dixie Chicks. Robison plays banjo, dobro, guitar, bass, mandolin, accordion, and sitar. Initially in her career with the Dixie Chicks, she limited her singing to harmony with backing vocals, but within her role in the Court Yard Hounds, she has taken on the role of lead vocalist.\\n\\nEmily Erwin was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask moved the family to the northern suburban town of Addison, Texas on the edge of Dallas, where she was raised with her two older sisters, Julia and Martha. Her parents were both educators and nurtured the growing interest that both Emily and Martha (later nicknamed Martie) shared, and together both sisters became proficient on several instruments while in elementary school. \\n\\nEmily began playing the violin at age seven, and the banjo at age ten, afterward learning all the string instruments she could find. Years later, Martie joked that Emily was better than she at the fiddle, and because she wanted to keep the fiddle as her instrument, she forced Emily to learn something else. Emily responded by mastering the five string banjo, by reading books to teach herself the chord progressions. \\n\\nFrom 1984-1989, Jane Frost, (Director of the Patsy Montana Museum and the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas), remembers watching the sisters mature, teaming up with schoolmates Troy and Sharon Gilchrist. The foursome were touring in a teenage bluegrass group they named the Blue Night Express, in part because of the amount of travelling they had to do to reach far away festivals, frequently with a parent or friend of the family towing them back home long after dark at night. They thought it was worth the sacrifices to meet their musical heroes and experienced the friendly comraderie and tricks of the trade on instruments from others. The sisters were said to have an \"almost obsessive\" interest in busking at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals. After Martie graduated from secondary school at Greenhill School (Addison, Texas) with Emily still completing her studies, both remained active in the bluegrass scene.\\n\\nthumb \\n\\nIn 1989, after years of attending bluegrass festivals and busking where they could, Emily joined her sister Martie, guitarist Robin Lynn Macy, and upright bass player Laura Lynch. Frost, again, recalls being privy to the discussion that the four women had about the possibility of a successful career as musicians together. Martie felt they could do well. Robin said,\".. It's going to be a 'hot' band,\" to which Emily responded, \"I give it six months, and if we aren't making money by then, I'm out of here!\". Robison was shy, and the youngest member of the group. She had enjoyed playing throughout school, but was at an age where she was already entertaining thoughts of working hard to be accepted by the United States Air Force Academy.\\n\\nBy 1993, the band had evolved into a new direction. Macy left the group for a \"purer\" bluegrass sound. Lynch, thrust into the position of sole lead singer, was replaced by the sisters in 1995 with singer composer Natalie Maines after the group was unable to garner anything more than local interest. Robison commented, \"We were prepared to pay our dues for as long as it took; we were prepared for longevity. We know that we will always be playing music together, so we wanted to find someone who is just as determined and energetic as we are.\" \\n\\nBut in later interviews, the sisters revealed what many had thought for a long time: the reason Lynch was replaced was not commitment but a perceived lack of talent. In an article in the April/May edition of Country Music Magazine, Emily stated, \"We felt we needed the next calibre of singer.\"\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nFrom there, massive commercial success ensued, with their 1998 and 1999 albums Wide Open Spaces and Fly both achieving diamond record status. Robison was a key element of the group's look, with her hair dyed blond to match the other two at first, and then allowing it to return to her natural brunette color, and distinguishing herself visually from the other two. Robison and Maguire's instrumental virtuosity set the Chicks apart from many other country acts, male and female. Robison's songwriting has also been a factor in the Chicks' recording career. \\n\\nRobison stood by Maines when the controversy over Maines' remarks about U.S. President George W. Bush hit the newswire on the eve before the Iraq War in 2003. She was the only bandmate to realize that, while in the U.K., there was a big anti-war sentiment in the audience, but that back in the United States, Maines' criticism of President Bush would not be well received. Nevertheless, even when her home was trashed, and plenty of editorials were predicting the end of the Dixie Chicks' successful careers in music, she remained loyal to Maines, as did her sister.\\n\\nthumbRobison spent at least half of her life busking and touring nearly non-stop since high school, first with her older sister, and then with the changing lineups of the Dixie Chicks. After the bandmates celebrated their five Grammy Award for Taking the Long Way, the trio all had young children and took time out to spend with them, but Robison was eager to return to writing and touring. When Robison's marriage came to an end, she began expressing herself by songwriting. Some of her compositions include her feelings about the breakup with her former husband, and expected that soon, the band would resume its former schedule of writing and performing, but Natalie Maines was reticent to do so. After four years, Robison became \"angry and frustrated\", and in sending her new songs to her sister, conveyed her increasing disappointment. With Natalie Maines taking a break from music, Rolling Stone magazine announced in January 2010 that Emily and sister Martie have formed a side project called the Court Yard Hounds, with Robison as lead vocalist. The band made their live debut in March at South by Southwest with an album released in May, 2010. Robison wrote all but one of the songs on their album.\\n\\nOn May 1, 1999, Emily married country singer Charlie Robison. Martie later revealed on a VH-1 program that during their courtship, she had written the romantic hit song, \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" for them.\\n\\nThe Robisons have three children: Charles Augustus, called \"Gus\", born November 11, 2002 and twins Julianna Tex and Henry Benjamin born on April 14, 2005. \\n\\nEmily and Charlie divorced on August 6, 2008, after nine years of marriage.\\n\\n"}

She is currently the British no. 7 and ranked 310 in the world (as of 3 August 2009). So far in her career she has won two International Tennis Federation singles titles and six ITF doubles titles. She has also reached the second round of her home Grand Slam, Wimbledon, on one occasion in 2004.\\n\\nWebley-Smith was born in 1984 in Thornbury, Avon, which is now in South Gloucestershire. Her mother, Jane, is a PE teacher and her father, Mike, an amateur footballer and cricketer. She also has a sister named Hannah. Her first introduction to tennis was playing swingball in her garden and in the cricket grounds where her father was the club captain. Were she not a tennis player, she would like to be traveling the world as a translator or playing hockey for England. Webley-Smith describes herself as \"individual, deep, emotional, optimistic and resilient\".\\n\\nProblems with Webley-Smith's right ankle began in 2002 when she broke it whilst on court competing in the qualifying tournament for the $25,000 ITF event in Cardiff and underwent surgery to repair both the bone and the damaged caused to the ligaments. She was unable to compete on the tour for six months.\\n\\nIn November 2003 she needed a second operation on her ankle to remove cartilage which had come loose; an operation which was successful and enabled Emily to play injury-free tennis for almost two years and reach her career-high world ranking of no. 262 in June 2005.\\n\\nHowever she had to take yet more time out later in 2005 when she began experiencing sharp pains in the same ankle while warming up for an ITF tournament in Puebla, Mexico. She had treatment on the ankle again and returned, with limited success, to competitive tennis in Spring 2006 before having surgery for a third time to remove fluid from her ankle.\\n\\nShe began recovering well before septicaemia left her with an agonisingly swollen ankle and unable to walk for five whole weeks. Webley-Smith said of the time, \"My ankle was the size of a football. I remember the doctor trying to take my sock off and I was screaming. I was taking what they call an 'elephant dose' of antibiotics and the strongest painkillers they could give me\". She returned full time to the circuit in August 2006.\\n\\nIn 2009 she also began to have trouble with her wrist after injuring it during an ITF event in Tanjung Selor in Indonesia, just a number of weeks before Wimbledon. It recovered well enough in time for Webley-Smith to compete in the Wimbledon qualifying rounds however she reaggravated the injury later in the year and was unable to compete again until February 2010.\\n\\nWebley-Smith played her first junior ITF tournament in February 1998 and her last in July 2002.

It was her only professional match in 1999.\\n\\nIn 2000 she played a total of six tournaments. She lost in the qualifying rounds of four $10,000 events in Great Britain (Bournemouth, Frinton, Hatfield and Sunderland), lost in the first round of another (in Glasgow) and was also beaten in the first round of the $25,000 event in Felixstowe by countywoman, Jane O'Donoghue, 4–6 3–6.\\n\\nThe 2001 season began well for Webley-Smith as in her very first tournament of the year she qualified and reached the quarterfinals of the $10,000 event in Jersey before being beaten by Anne Keothavong, 3–6 6–7. Unfortunately for Emily she was unable to continue this form for the rest of the year, losing in the qualifying stages in every other tournament she entered with the exception of the $10,000 Sunderland ITF where she was defeated again by Keothavong, 3–6 4–6. She also played in the main draw of her final ITF tournament of the year as a lucky loser but was again beaten in round one. She ended the year ranked world no. 712.\\n\\nWebley-Smith had a varied year in 2002, with limited success on the ITF tour but also her first appearance in a Grand Slam at Wimbledon where she lost in the first round of qualifying to Nina Duebbers, 1–6 2–6. She only reached one ITF quarterfinal in 2002, at the $10,000 London event in August.

Her year-end ranking for 2005 was world no. 385.\\n\\nWebley-Smith spent much of the 2006 season out of action due to suffering from septicaemia as a result of her long-term ankle problems which began in 2002. She was forced to retire in only her second match of the year in February and was unable to compete again until August when she reached the semifinals of a $10,000 ITF tournament in London and the quarterfinals a $10,000 tournament in Istanbul. She was beaten by compatriot Naomi Cavaday in either the first or second round in three out of four consecutive $25,000 tournaments in September, October and November that year.

It covers the period of time from when she was 16 (~1777) to shortly after Admiral Nelson’s death (~44 years old in 1805).

Initially, the College catered only for Senior School students in Years 8 and 9 and higher year levels were added in the following years. A Junior School commenced operation on the site with over 150 students in January 1989. In the early years, staff and students were housed in demountable buildings. The College has embarked on a significant construction program over the last decade, which has transformed the face of the campus and replaced almost all of the original temporary buildings. \\n\\nThe most notable projects include the completion in 1999 of the IAC building, comprising a library and administration and information technology centres, an aquatic centre featuring a 25 metre swimming pool in 2001 and in more recent years, a Performing Arts Centre, gymnasium, a multi-purpose basketball and tennis court complex, an Early Years (Prep - Year 3) building and play area and an extension and renovation of the hospitality building. Most recently, in 2007, a state of the art, multi-million dollar Science Block was built to cater for all science needs. The building contains numerous labs and general classrooms equipped with technology and equipment. \\n\\nThe former Science Block was transformed into Business and Film & TV classrooms, complete with apple computers and IT equipment. Other newly installed technologies include the installation of Interactive Whiteboard among many of the classrooms to further enhance learning, as well as the completion of air-conditioning all rooms in the school. Emmanuel College celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2005.\\n\\nThe Junior School of Emmanuel College begins at Preparatory and finishes at Year 7, with a total of 655 students. The Head of Junior School is Mr Jason Hewitt. The curriculum covers the subjects of English, SOSE, Science, Mathematics, PE, Technology, Music and Art. \\n\\nAs a class they also attend the library weekly and are encouraged to read nightly, to improve their spelling and creative writing skills. As a year level, all students attend a weekly chapel service with Dr. King, which encourages students to be involved with the Bible and God.\\n\\nA progress report is written for each student after the first term, which is a short summary on how the child is progressing with the literacy and numeracy fields, whilst focusing on the conduct and effort of the student throughout their time in the class thus far. A full semester report card is written after the first and second semesters (Term 1 & 2, Term 3 & 4 respectively). \\n\\nYear 6 students are introduced to the Science Labs of the Senior School and learn the expectations and rules for the lab and the equipment within it. This eases the transition that occurs between Junior and Senior School by introducing them to a major part of Senior School life.\\n\\nYear 7 students are familiarised with many of the Senior School staff as they study one Year 8 elective each term (one lesson a week). This introduces the students to a some of the staff that teach these electives as well as showing what the electives are about. Whilst in Year 7, the students must also study a semester of both German and Chinese, to meet the teachers of the subject and to allow them to experience both languages before having to choose one to study in Year 8.\\n\\nThe senior school of Emmanuel College begins in Year 8 and students graduate in Year 12. The Head of Senior School is Mr Bewley. There are 658 Students who attend the Senior School.\\n\\nThe Year 8 program is focussed on easing the students into the life of Secondary School. They experience, for the first time, having to change classrooms for each class and being in multiple classes each day. They are guided through the process with a Year 8 Orientation Day and are assisted by their Home Class teachers along the way. \\n\\nYear 8 students study the core subjects of English, Maths, SOSE, Science, Christian Education, Computers and PE. They must also choose two electives from Hospitality (Cooking Studies), Music, Design Technology, Art and Drama, all of which they experienced in Year 7. They also have to choose a language from either Chinese or German, which they also experienced in Year 7. \\n\\nYear 8 students are also introduced to proper time management skills, lots and lots of Christian Education, through the completion of study skills booklet and programme. They are expected to complete many more assignments than in Junior School, which introduces them to what they will experience later in school and university life. They are also given more comprehensive tests, to assess their understanding, knowledge and comprehension of their studied subjects. These assessment techniques (tests and assignments) teach them time management, study skills and the ideal way in which to complete assignments.\\n\\nThe College offers many dance and instrumental tuition programs to students. There are also a large number of instrumental and vocal ensembles at the College including orchestras, concert bands, stage bands and choirs. Both Junior and Senior Schools also regularly produce high-quality musicals.\\n\\nThe orchestras, bands and choirs perform regularly, both within the school and outside. The groups also compete regularly at many regional, state and national competitions.\\n\\nPerforming Arts captains (one male, one female) are appointed in both Junior and Senior School to represent the school at many of the events bands and orchestras attend. Performing Arts awards are also awarded to one male and one female of each grade, from Year 3 upwards.\\n\\nSport is a compulsory element of school life for all students. Emmanuel College is a founding member of the prestigious Associated Private Schools (APS) sporting competition, consisting of eight private secondary schools on the Gold Coast. Students are placed in one of four houses: Luther, Taylor, Wesley and Wycliffe for College swimming, cross-country and athletics carnivals, from which the best performing students are chosen to compete on behalf of the College in the APS (District) and Gold Coast South District carnivals (the APS forms its own district in Secondary School). Students also have a wide range of sports to choose from in the winter and summer season competitions in which they compete against the APS member schools for the premiership. Within the team sport competitions, Most Valuable Player and Most Improved Player awards are given to students of each team. \\n\\nEmmanuel College has an honourable sporting reputation. The number of State, Regional and District Representatives have increased significantly in recent years. The College has also emerged as a standout performer in the APS competition in recent years, in terms of the number of APS District Sporting Premierships won. Emmanuel's strength in swimming was illustrated in 2005 when it placed first in both Junior and Senior APS Swimming Carnivals. \\n\\nThe students are rewarded for their achievements in sport through the sports award system. Through this system, students can receive badges and trophies dependent upon their level of achievement. The awards include: Gold, Silver and Bronze badges, Sports Merit Certificates and Special Sporting Awards. As well as this, at the end of year Presentation Nights and Sports Award Nights, the best performing male and female of each grade (Years 4 - 12), are awarded Sportsperson of the Year awards.\\n\\nA few noteworthy accomplishments have been made by former Emmanuel Students. In 1994 Joe Chapman and Tavis Gorman represented Australia in the Lawn Bowls Pairs Category at the Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Commonwealth games. Unfortunately they were knocked out in the semi-finals.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emmanuel Schools Foundation", "body": "The Emmanuel Schools Foundation (ESF) is a charitable trust which has been involved in education since 1989.\\n\\nESF sponsored four schools: Emmanuel City Technology College in Gateshead (opened 1990), The King's Academy in Middlesbrough (2003), Trinity Academy in Thorne, Doncaster (2005) and Bede Academy in Blyth, Northumberland which opened in September 2009. In 2004, the Foundation's former chairman, Sir Peter Vardy, discussed an aim to sponsor seven schools in the North of England that would educate a total of 10,000 students.\\n\\nIts four schools have been oversubscribed every year.\\n\\nAlthough the Government allows academies to select 10% of pupils by ability, ESF Academies do not do so, being fully comprehensive school for local children. They have a Christian ethos, but are not faith schools and welcome staff and students of all faiths and of none.\\n\\nIn 1988, Sir Peter Vardy responded to the then Government’s appeal to local businessmen to become involved in the education of young people in the most socio-economically deprived parts of their home regions through sponsorship of the City Technology College initiative. The aim of the initiative was twofold:\\n\\nThe first ESF school, Emmanuel City Technology College, was founded in 1990 as Tyneside’s City Technology College and opened with just 150 students in Year 7. John Burn (Headteacher of Long Benton) had been instrumental in persuading Peter Vardy to engage in the CTC programme. Originally specialising in Technology, the College was awarded a second specialism in Business and Enterprise (2005), allowing it to build upon its Beacon School and current Leading Edge Status through its extensive work in delivering specialist teaching programmes within Primary Schools.\\n\\nESF went on to open its next two schools in 2003 and 2005. However, the Foundation's approach was not universally welcomed, and in 2004 opponents blocked the Foundation's bid to take over Northcliffe School in Conisbrough, near Doncaster, which Ofsted had placed under special measures.\\n\\nIn February 2009 the Foundation announced that Sir Peter Vardy was to step down as chairman, to be succeeded by his brother, David Vardy, who had previously been Project Director of the foundation, overseeing the building of the schools. In September 2009 it was announced that David Wootton would join from the Grace Foundation to become ESF's first Chief Executive.\\n\\nIn September 2009 ESF also opened its fourth school, Bede Academy, which is its first covering the whole school age range of 3-18, with Nursery, Primary and Secondary provision across two sites in Blyth on the Northumberland coast. Specialising in Engineering and Enterprise, the school focuses on extending conventional perceptions of engineering by providing specialist insights into aspects of biotechnology, environmental science and recycling technologies, sound and computer network engineering, medical and animal science, and naval and automotive systems and design.\\n\\nIn October 2010 it was announced that Sir Peter Vardy was handing over management of the schools to the United Learning Trust.\\n\\nEmmanuel College claims that its students, taught as part of a mixed, non-selective comprehensive school, perform significantly above all value-add measures and their academic results have placed the College amongst the highest ranked schools in England for the past ten years.\\n\\nA 2009 report on the The King's Academy by Ofsted referred to many improvements, with the school officially ranked as \"good, with many outstanding features\". Inspectors said the academy was exceptional when it came to boosting students' personal development and well-being, and offering them care, guidance and support.\\n\\nIn 2002, a group of leading scientists including Richard Dawkins alleged that creationism was taught in biology classes at Emmanuel College. \\n\\nHowever, after re-inspecting the material used to teach science at Emmanuel College, Ofsted decided that the matter did not need to be pursued further. The next Ofsted inspection in 2006 described the school as 'Outstanding' and found no problem with its science provision.\\n\\nIn 2005, John Harris in The Guardian accused Emmanuel Schools Foundation of promoting fundamentalist Christianity. However, a follow-up article by the paper in 2006 was strongly supportive of ESF, and said that associating its schools with creationism \"couldn't be more wrong.\"\\n\\nDespite this refutation, political opponents of academies continue to refer to the original accusation. After Tribune magazine published such an article in 2009, Peter Vardy took legal action against the magazine and its editor, who apologised, withdrew the allegations, and made an undisclosed payment to a nominated charity.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emotions in decision making", "body": "Recent research suggests that emotions are just as influential as cognitive processes when it comes to decision making. This is interesting because emotions are often considered irrational occurrences that may distort reasoning (Barnes and Thagard, 1996). According to Sayegh, et al. (2004), the conventional way of thinking about decision making is to banish emotion from its decisions entirely. According to them, the decision makers should act using a “cool head” where decisions should come only from rational and cognitive processes to obtain the best results. The implications of emotions during decision making processes have only recently been discussed in some detail. With the growing body of knowledge on emotions in decision making, researchers have proposed various theories to help further our understanding of what influences the decisions that we make.\\n\\nLoewenstein, et al. (2001) suggest the role of ‘anticipatory’ and ‘anticipated’ emotions in decision making processes. According to them, “anticipatory emotions are immediate visceral reactions” like fear, anxiety, dread about uncertainties, often felt during decision making whereas “anticipated emotions” such as disappointment or regret are typically “not experienced in the immediate present but are expected to be experienced as a result of a decision.” According to Bagozzi, et al. (2003) anticipated emotions plays an important role to determine the actions of the decision makers, when dealing with a judgement, like what to choose and why choose it.\\n\\nA study done by Isen and Shalker (1982) showed how one’s emotion affects his/her cognitive process. A group of sixty students were randomly assigned to groups and the researchers intentionally generated different conditions for each group. All students were asked to evaluate slides shown to them as pleasant, unpleasant or ambiguous. Evaluations by students who were assigned to “successful” conditions were higher than those by students who were not assigned to any condition. On the other hand, “failure” students showed lower evaluation on all the slides compared with unconditioned students. Isen and Shalker (1982) concluded that “good mood provides access to positive associations in memory and that these weigh in the evaluation”. The study also stated that one’s mood strongly affects decisions especially on ambiguous objects which could be either positive or negative (Isen & Shalker 1982).\\n\\nAnother research done by Isen and Patric (1983) put forth the theory of “mood maintenance” which states that happy decision-makers are reluctant to gamble. In other words, happy people decide against gambling, since they would not want to undermine the happy feeling. \\n\\nAlternately, the influence of negative feelings at the time of decision making was studied by Raghunathan and Tuan Pham (1999). They conducted three experiments in gambling decisions and job selection decisions, where unhappy subjects were found to prefer high-risk/high-reward options unlike anxious subjects who preferred low-risk/low-reward options. They stated that “anxiety and sadness convey distinct types of information to the decision-maker and prime different goals.” It was found that “while anxiety primes an implicit goal of uncertainty reduction, sadness primes an implicit goal of reward replacement” (Raghunathan & Tuan Pham 1999). Thus emotions cannot simply be classified as positive or negative as we need to consider the consequences of the emotions in ultimate decision making.\\n\\nAnother important factor is memory of events in decision making. Isen and Shalker (1982) illustrated how one’s mood works as “a retrieval cue” whereby happy feelings make positive materials come to mind which in turn have great impact on one’s decision. The same is true of negative feelings. Bower (1981) referred to it as “state-dependent remembering” which was echoed by Sayegh, et al. (2004). Both papers stated that emotions and feelings cannot be extracted from the human mind. The emotions felt in a particular situation will be recorded in the emotional memory and can be activated when the person faces a similar situation or has to make a difficult decision in a short period of time. Often the decision maker is unaware of previous experiences in similar situations.\\n\\nThe somatic marker hypothesis is a very relevant theory when discussing emotions in decision making. It states that bioregulatory signals such as feelings and emotions provide the principal guide for decisions where individuals, when dealing with a judgement, will assess the severity of the outcomes, their probability of occurrence and their emotional quality to provide their decision (Bechara, et al., 2000). According to Dunn, et al. (2006) “the somatic marker hypothesis proposes that ‘somatic marker’ biasing signals from the body are represented and regulated in the emotion circuitry of the brain, particularly the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), to help regulate decision-making in situations of complexity and uncertainty”. Therefore, in situations of complexity and uncertainty, the marker signals allow the brain to recognise the situation and respond quickly (Dunn, et al., 2006).\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, there is an intimate connection between emotion and cognition in practical decision making. Damasio, et al. (1990) used somatic marker hypothesis to explain how emotions are biologically indispensable to decisions. He suggested that when choosing between options that differ in relative risk, a somatic marker (for example, a “gut feeling”) feeds back to the brain and influences cognitive appraisal (Damasio, et al., 1990).\\n\\nThus emotions often unwittingly form the basis of many of our decisions and the conventional belief that cognitive processes alone run our decision making processes has been disregarded. It is in fact an interplay between emotions and cognition that helps us during decision making processes.\\n\\nBagozzi, R. P. Dholakia, U. M. & Basuroy, S., 2003.

{"title": "Empress He (Ling)", "body": "Empress He (何皇后, personal name unknown) (died 189), formally Empress Lingsi (靈思皇后, literally, \"the unattentive and deep-thinking empress\") was an empress during Han Dynasty. She was Emperor Ling's second wife. Along with her brother He Jin, she was able to temporarily dominate power at the imperial court after the death of Emperor Ling in 189 as empress dowager.\\n\\nUnlike most Han Dynasty empresses, Empress He was not from a noble family; rather, her father He Zhen (何真) was a butcher in Nanyang (南陽, in modern Nanyang, Henan). Her mother was named Xing (興). It is not known when she was selected as an imperial consort. According to legends, she was selected to be an imperial consort after her family paid bribes to the eunuch selecting imperial consorts. She was said to be far taller than the average woman and very beautiful. In 176, she gave birth to Emperor Ling's oldest surviving son Liu Bian. (Emperor Ling had previous sons who, however, all died in infancy or childhood.) Based on customs of the time, in order to let Prince Bian avoid the fate of his older brothers, he was entrusted to the magician Shi Zimiao (史子眇) and known by the circumspect title \"Marquess Shi.\" In 180, Emperor Ling created Consort He empress to replace his first wife Empress Song, who was deposed in 171.\\n\\nAs empress, Empress He was said to be greatly favored by Emperor Ling. She was also described as very jealous and very cruel, and the imperial consorts were all fearful of her. After she became empress, her mother Lady Xing was created the Lady of Wuyang, and her brothers He Jin and He Miao (何苗) began to be promoted quickly.\\n\\nIn 181, a concubine of Emperor Ling, Consort Wang, gave birth to a son named Liu Xie. The jealous Empress He assassinated her by poisoning her rice porridge. Emperor Ling was enraged and wanted to depose her, but the eunuchs pleaded on her behalf, and she was not deposed. Prince Xie was raised personally by Emperor Ling's mother Empress Dowager Dong and known by the circumspect title \"Marquess Dong.\"\\n\\nAs the princes grew in age, Emperor Ling considered whom to create crown prince. Prince Bian was born of the empress and was older, but Emperor Ling viewed his behavior as being insufficiently solemn and therefore considered creating Prince Xie crown prince, but hesitated and could not decide.\\n\\nEmperor Ling died in 189. The powerful eunuch Jian Shuo, whom he trusted, wanted to first kill He Jin and then make Prince Xie emperor, and therefore set up a trap at a meeting he was to have with He. He found out, and preemptorily declared Prince Bian emperor (later known as the Prince of Hongnong). Empress He became empress dowager, and she and He Jin became the key power at court, although a number of the eunuchs remained very powerful.\\n\\nA confrontation quickly brewed. In the summer of 189, He Jin, plotting with Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu, as well as a number of other young officials, planned to act against Jian. Jian tried to persuade his fellow powerful eunuchs, including Zhao Zhong and Song Dian (宋典), to go along with his plan to arrest and kill He Jin. However, Zhao and Song were persuaded by another eunuch, Guo Sheng (郭勝) -- a friend of the Hes—to turn down Jian's suggestions. He Jin then arrested Jian and executed him, taking over the forces under his control.\\n\\nThe Hes then had a confrontation with yet another power center. Emperor Ling's mother, Grand Empress Dowager Dong, and her nephew Dong Chong (董重) were displeased at the Hes' power grab, and Grand Empress Dowager Dong often argued with Empress Dowager He, once threatening to have Dong Chong decapitate He Jin. He Jin took preemptive action and had Empress Dowager He issue an edict exiling her mother-in-law back to Hejian (in modern Baoding, Hebei), where her husband's fief was and Dong Chong arrested. Dong Chong committed suicide, and Grand Empress Dowager Dong died soon thereafter—with most historical accounts concluding that she died from fear, but some suggested that she committed suicide. This event caused the Hes to be very unpopular among the people.\\n\\nIn autumn 189, Yuan Shao suggested to He Jin that the eunuchs be slaughtered—a proposal that Empress He immediately rejected, as the plan would have required that Empress He interact with normal men on a regular basis, a requirement that she found offensive and inmodest. Lady Xian and He Miao also opposed the plan, reasoning that they owed much to the eunuchs. He Jin was therefore hesitant to carry out his plan, and he and Yuan Shao hatched an alternative plan that would later prove disastrous—instructing generals outside the hospital to declare rebellions and demanding that the eunuchs be slaughtered, in order to force Empress He to do so. One of the generals that He Jin so instructed was Dong Zhuo, then in command of the battle-tested Liang Province (涼州, modern Gansu) forces—not remembering that Dong Zhuo had previous records for disobeying direct orders and undue harshness.\\n\\nAs Dong approached the capital with his forces, Empress Dowager He was forced to order the powerful eunuchs to leave the palace and return to their marches. (Most of these powerful eunuchs were created marquesses by Emperor Ling.) However, after the eunuchs' leader, Zhang Rang pleaded with his daughter-in-law (Empress Dowager He's sister), Empress Dowager He relented and summoned them back to the palace. The eunuchs then found out that He Jin in fact planned to exterminate them, and they tricked He Jin into falling into an ambush and getting killed. He Jin's associates, led by Yuan Shao, then surrounded the palace, and the eunuchs took Empress Dowager He, the young emperor, and Prince Xie hostage, although Empress Dowager He soon escaped. Meanwhile, Yuan Shao had the other eunuchs mass-executed, and also killed He Miao for not having cooperated with He Jin.\\n\\nTwo days later, the several eunuchs holding the emperor and Prince Xie hostage, knowing that they were in desperate straits, took the emperor and the prince and fled north toward the river. With government officials Lu Zhi and Min Gong (閔貢) on their heels, the eunuchs, led by Zhang Rang, released the emperor and Prince Xie and committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River. As Min and Lu were escorting the emperor and the prince back to the capital Luoyang, they were intercepted by Dong Zhuo's forces. As Dong came up to meet them, the young emperor was so shocked that he spoke incoherently and could not answer Dong Zhuo's questions. The younger Prince Xie, however, had no such difficulty in describing the events. Dong became impressed by the younger prince, and, because he shared the same name with the late Grand Empress Dowager Dong, began to consider deposing the emperor and replacing him with Prince Xie.\\n\\nDong quickly took over the capital by using his forces to intimidate others. Yuan Shao and Cao Cao, then in command of the palace guards, saw that they could no longer control their forces, which had been so intimidated by the stronger Liang Province forces that they were not following orders, fled the capital. Dong then ordered the young emperor deposed (and created the Prince of Hongnong), and Empress Dowager He was forced to agree. Prince Xie was declared emperor (as Emperor Xian).\\n\\nDong then accused Empress Dowager He of having been filially unpious toward Grand Empress Dowager Dong, and forcibly moved her to an unused palace. He then had her poisoned to death. While she was still buried with an empress title with her husband Emperor Ling, she was not honored with the proper ceremonies due an empress dowager, and Dong also had her mother, Lady Xian, executed. Her son, the Prince of Hongnong, would also suffer the same fate in 190.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Empress Wei Zifu", "body": "Empress Wei Zifu (Traditional Chinese: 衛子夫; Simplified Chinese: 卫子夫; pinyin: Weì Zǐfū) (died 91 BC), formally Wei Sihou (衛思后), was an empress during Han Dynasty. She was Emperor Wu's second wife, and stayed as his empress for 38 years, the second longest in Chinese history (after Empress Wang of Ming's Wanli Emperor). She was also the half sister of the famed general Wei Qing, the younger aunt of Huo Qubing and the step-aunt of Han statesman Huo Guang.\\n\\nWei Zifu was born from humble means, as an illegitimate child. She therefore took the family name of her mother's husband, who was a servant at the household of Princess Pingyang (平陽公主), Emperor Wu's sister. Her brother Wei Qing was also an illegitimate child, of a different father. When Wei Zifu was still young, she became a singing dancer at the princess' estate.\\n\\nEmperor Wu initially loved his first wife, Empress Chen Jiao greatly but after Empress Chen was unable to bear him a son after years of marriage, she began to lose favor. Circa 139 BC, Emperor Wu paid a visit to his sister Princess Pingyang, who had prepared a collection of young women to offer for his concubinage (girls from lowly background, such as Wei Zifu, were not included), in order to establish herself political leverage. However, the plan did not work — all the candidates failed to impress the Emperor. Realizing her brother was bored, the Princess called in the dancers for entertainment. This time, the Emperor set his eyes on Wei and had immediately fallen for her beauty. Taking the opportunity of visiting the restroom, the young Emperor took advantage on the young singer, whom the Princess ordered to follow in and serve as a handmaid. Princess Pingyang therefore offered Wei to Emperor Wu to become part of his concubinage.\\n\\nHowever, what Wei Zifu would experience later on was far from a lovely cinderella story. Empress Chen, upon hearing the arrival of the new concubine, went on an emotional rampage which forced Emperor Wu to abandon his idea of making Wei his concubine. Wei Zifu then was demoted to an insignificant palace maid and was largely forgotten by the Emperor. More than a year later, feeling hopeless with her life inside the palaces, Wei blended into a queue of palace maids waiting to be expelled from the palace (normally those who were aged or incompetent in palace services) in the hope of getting out. Coincidentally, Emperor Wu happened to be there inspecting the expulsion process, and love soon re-flamed when he saw the tearful young girl pleaing to go home. Wei was made to stay and fell pregnant very shortly later. This was exciting news for Emperor Wu, who was very upset over being partially blamed for Empress Chen's infertility. At the time, Emperor Wu's throne was under threat due to his previous political clash with Grand Empress Dowager Dou in the failed 139 BC reform, after which many royal members supported the idea of deposing him under the excuse that he was incapable of fathering children, and making his uncle Liu An the successor. Wei Zifu's pregnancy cleared Emperor Wu's name, and ensured her becoming greatly favored over Empress Chen.\\n\\nEmpress Chen became exceedingly jealous of Wei Zifu, and Empress Chen's mother, Princess Liu Piao (劉嫖) tried to take vengeance by kidnapping Wei's younger brother Wei Qing, who was then a servant at a marquess' household, and she considered killing him. Wei Qing, however, was rescued from the princess' estate by his friends, led by Gongsun Ao (公孫敖). In response to the incident and as a sign of annoyance towards Empress Chen and Princess Piao, Emperor Wu made Wei Zifu a Consort (a concubine position lower only to the Empress), and resided closely to himself. Wei Qing was appointed the head of the household at Jianzhang Palace, away from where the princess might be able to harm him. While being an imperial concubine, Consort Wei almost monopolized the Emperor's love and bore him three daughters.\\n\\nIn 130 BC, Empress Chen was discovered to have retained witches to use witchcraft in the attempt to restore her husband's love to her and to curse other concubines, Consort Wei in particular. She was deposed for this misconduct against imperial moral standards, but Consort Wei was not made empress at this time, because she too was sonless like the other concubines. In 128 BC, she finally bore Emperor Wu his first son, Liu Ju, and she was created Empress later that year. Her son was created Crown Prince in 122 BC.\\n\\nAfter Wei Zifu became empress, Emperor Wu honored her family greatly. Wei Qing was made a key general in the war effort against Xiongnu, and after he achieved a series of victories, not only he, but also his three young sons, were made marquess (although he declined the offer for his sons, suggesting instead that the emperor promote his subordinates). Similarly promoted and honored was her nephew Huo Qubing, a great general in his own right. Despite the fact that the rise of the Wei family largely owed credit to the military talent of Wei Qing and Huo Qubing, Wei Zifu was often seen as the backbone of the family. A contemporary folk song sang:\\n\\nBecause the great achievements of this Wei family, many later Han emperors considered marrying concubines with the surname Wei as a way of attaining good fortune.\\n\\nAs the years went by, the sexual attraction to Empress Wei by Emperor Wu would decrease tremendously. He favored several other concubines, including Consort Li (the sister of Li Guangli and Li Yannian) and Consort Zhao. However, he continued to respect Empress Wei's judgment in governing the palace, and he entrusted her with palace affairs while he would be out of the capital, while entrusting the governmental affairs to her son, Crown Prince Ju.\\n\\nIn his advanced age, Emperor Wu became fairly paranoid about the use of witchcraft against him. In 96 BC, a series of witchcraft persecutions would begin. Large numbers of people, many of whom were high officials and their families, were accused of witchcraft and executed, usually with their clans. The first trial began with General Gongsun Ao and his wife, leading to the execution of their clan. Soon, these witchcraft persecutions would become intertwined in the succession struggles and erupt into a major catastrophe.\\n\\nIn 94 BC, Emperor Wu's youngest son Liu Fuling was born to Consort Zhao. Emperor Wu was ecstatic in having a child at his advanced age (62), and because Consort Zhao purportedly had a pregnancy that lasted 14 months long -- the same length as the mythical Emperor Yao -- he named Consort Zhao's palace gate \"Gate of Yao's Mother.\" This led to speculations that he, due to his favor for Consort Zhao and Prince Fuling, wanted to make Prince Fuling crown prince instead. While there was no evidence that he actually intended to do anything of the such, over the next few years, there began to be conspirators against Crown Prince Ju and Empress Wei.\\n\\nOne of the conspirators against Prince Ju would be Jiang Chong (江充), the head of the secret intelligence, who once had a run-in with Prince Ju after arresting one of Prince Ju's assistants for improper use of an imperial right of way. It appears likely that Jiang was behind many of the witchcraft accusations against important persons -- including Prince Ju's sisters Princesses Zhuyi and Yangshi and cousin Wei Kang (衛伉) (Wei Qing's son), who were executed in 91 BC after being accused of witchcraft. One other conspirator was Emperor Wu's guard Su Wen (蘇文), who had falsely accused Prince Ju of committing adultery with Emperor Wu's junior concubines.\\n\\nJiang and Su decided on using witchcraft as the excuse to move against Prince Ju. Jiang, with approval from Emperor Wu, who was then at his summer palace in Ganquan (甘泉, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), searched through various palaces, ostensibly for witchcraft items, eventually reaching Prince Ju's palace. He planted dolls and a piece of cloth with mysterious writing in Prince Ju's palace, and then announced that he found them there. Prince Ju was shocked. He considered his options, and his teacher Shi De (石德), invoking the story of Ying Fusu and raising the possibility that Emperor Wu might already be deceased, suggested that Prince Ju start an uprising. Prince Ju initially hesitated and wanted to speedily proceed to Ganquan to try to see his father to explain himself, but he found out that Jiang's messengers were already on their way. He decided to accept Shi's suggestion.\\n\\nPrince Ju then sent an individual to impersonate a messenger from Emperor Wu to arrest Jiang and his coconspirators — except for Su, who escaped. After they were arrested, Prince Ju personally killed Jiang. He then led the guards of his and Empress Wei's palaces and prepared to defend himself. Su fled to Ganquan Palace and told Emperor Wu that Prince Ju was committing treason. Emperor Wu, not believing it to be true and correctly (at this point) believing that Prince Ju had merely been angry at Jiang, send a messenger back to Chang'an to summon Prince Ju. The messenger did not dare to proceed to Chang'an, but instead returned and falsely reported to Emperor Wu that Prince Ju was going to kill him. By now enraged, Emperor Wu ordered his nephew, Prime Minister Liu Qumao (劉屈犛), to put down the rebellion. The forces battled for five days, but Liu Qumao's forces prevailed after it became clear that Prince Ju did not have his father's authorization. Prince Ju fled the capital and eventually committed suicide.\\n\\nShortly after Prince Ju's escape, Emperor Wu sent two officials to Empress Wei's palace to seize her seal (i.e. to depose her). In response, she committed suicide, and was buried with a small coffin in the south of the city. Most of her clan members were killed in the turmoil.\\n\\nAfter her great-grandson Liu Bingyi (through Prince Ju) became emperor in 74 BC as Emperor Xuan, he had her reburied in a larger but relatively modest tomb, not with her husband Emperor Wu, and gave her the posthumous title Wei Si Hou (衛思后, literally meaning \"Empress Wei, the Deep Thinker\"). Her new tomb, due to its remote location and relative humbleness, escaped the looting by tomb raiders later.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Empress Yang Xianrong", "body": "Empress Yang Xianrong (羊獻容) (died 322), formally (as honored by Han Zhao) Empress Xianwen (獻文皇后, literally \"the wise and civil empress\") was an empress -- uniquely in the history of China, for two different empires and two different emperors. Her first husband was Emperor Hui of Jin, and her second husband was Liu Yao of Han Zhao. Also unique was the fact that she was deposed four and restored four times as the empress of Jin (five, if one counts a brief usurpation by Sima Lun against her husband in 301).\\n\\nYang Xianrong was from Taishan Commandery (roughly modern Tai'an, Shandong). Her father was the mid-level official Yang Xuanzhi (羊玄之). Her maternal grandfather was the general Sun Qi (孫旂), a distant relative of Sun Xiu (孫秀), the chief strategist for Sima Lun the Prince of Zhao. Therefore, after Sima Lun and Sun overthrew Empress Jia Nanfeng in 300, Sun had Yang Xianrong selected as the new empress. Little is known about how her relationship with her developmentally disabled husband (save her words to her second husband, referred to below) was. After Sima Lun briefly usurped the throne in 301 but was then defeated by Sima Jiong the Prince of Qi and Sima Ying the Prince of Chengdu, both Sun Xiu and Sun Qi were killed, along with their clans. Empress Yang's father Yang Xuanzhi was, however, promoted. (He would die in fear in 303, however, as his friendship with Sima Ai the Prince of Changsha was used as an excuse for Sima Ying and Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian to attack Sima Ai.)\\n\\nAs Emperor Hui continued to be a pawn of the princes during the War of the Eight Princes, Empress Yang herself appeared to have had little influence. She was, however, frequently used as an excuse for certain conspirators' actions, and during the span from 304 to 306 she was deposed four times and restored four times, often in conjunction with her husband's nephew Sima Qin (司馬覃)'s fortunes as crown prince. She was nearly killed after her fourth removal in 305, as Sima Yong, then holding Emperor Hui at Chang'an and leaving her in the capital Luoyang, became convinced that she was easily usable by his opponents as a rubber stamp, and so he ordered that she be forced to commit suicide. The governor of the capital region, Liu Tun (劉暾) offered a petition to save her life, which nearly cost him his own -- as Sima Yong ordered to have him arrested, and he was barely able to flee with his life. However, after Liu's intercession, for whatever reason, Sima Yong cancelled the order to have her forced to commit suicide.\\n\\nIn 306, as the War of the Eight Princes neared its end and Emperor Hui was allowed to return to Luoyang after Sima Yue the Prince of Donghai defeated Sima Yong, he welcomed Yang back as his empress. In early 307, however, he was poisoned to death. (Most historians believe that Sima Yue was behind the poisoning, but there is no conclusive evidence.) The recognized heir was Emperor Hui's brother, Sima Chi the crown prince, but Empress Yang, believing that she would not be honored as empress dowager if her brother-in-law inherited the throne, tried to have Sima Qin declared emperor; she was rebuffed by Sima Yue, however, and Crown Prince Chi succeeded to the throne as Emperor Huai. (Her attempt might have cost Prince Qin his life, as Sima Yue had him executed in 308.) Emperor Huai honored her with the title \"Empress Hui,\" but not empress dowager.\\n\\nEmpress Yang's influence or lack thereof during Emperor Huai's reign was unclear, but since Emperor Huai himself did not have much power (with Sima Yue still holding onto much the power), it was not likely that Empress Yang had significant influence. After Sima Yue's death in 311, the Jin armies were in shambles and unable to protect Luoyang any further. Luoyang soon fell to Han Zhao's armies, led by the generals Huyan Yan (呼延晏), Wang Mi (王彌), Shi Le, and Liu Yao the Prince of Shi'an. Liu Yao burnt most of Luoyang and executed a large number of Jin officials, but did not kill Empress Yang; instead, he took her as his own wife.\\n\\nLittle is known about Yang Xianrong's life with Liu Yao, other than that she was favored by him and bore him three sons -- Liu Xī, Liu Xí (劉襲, note different tone), and Liu Chan (劉闡). (It was not clear whether she was his wife or concubine by this point -- Liu Yao had an earlier wife, Princess Bu, who was described as having died and having been princess when her son Liu Yin was created the Prince of Yong'an in 323.) Liu Yao, as the trusted cousin of the Han Zhao emperor Liu Cong, had many military responsibilities and was in charge of the Chang'an region after he captured it and Emperor Huai's successor Emperor Min in 316. In 318, after the Han Zhao prime minister Jin Zhun massacred the Han Zhao imperial family and nobles in the capital Pingyang (平陽, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) after a coup, the officials who fled from the massacre offered the throne to Liu Yao, who accepted. After his and Shi Le's forces defeated Jin's, he moved the capital to Chang'an. In 319, he created Yang Xianrong his empress and her son Liu Xī crown prince. Once, Liu Yao asked her: \"How do I compare to the Sima man?\" Her response was:\\n\\nLiu Yao greatly favored her, and she was involved in governmental matters. She died in 322. Her son Liu Xī would continue to be crown prince, but both Liu Yao and Liu Xī were killed by Shi Le's Later Zhao forces after Han Zhao fell to Later Zhao in 329.\\n\\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"|-|-|-|- style=\"text-align: center;\"|-|-\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emygdius", "body": "Saint Emygdius (Emidius, Æmedius, Emigdius) () (d. c. 309 AD) was a Christian bishop who is venerated as a martyr. Tradition states that he was killed during the persecution of Diocletian. \\n\\nHis legend states that he was a pagan of Trier who became a Christian. He traveled to Rome and cured the paralytic daughter of his host Gratianus, who had let him stay with him at his house on Tiber Island. Gratianus' family then converted to Christianity.\\n\\nEmygdius also cured a blind man. The people of Rome believed him to be the son of Apollo and carried him off by force to the Temple of Aesculapius on the island in the Tiber, where he cured many of the sick. Emygdius declared himself a Christian, however, and tore down the pagan altars and smashed into pieces a statue of Aesculapius. He also converted many to Christianity; this enraged the prefect of the city.\\n\\nHe was made a bishop by Pope Marcellus I (or Pope Marcellinus), and sent to Ascoli Piceno.\\n\\nOn his way to Ascoli, Emydgius made more conversions, and performed a miracle where he made water gush out of a mountain after striking a cliff. Polymius, the local governor, attempted to convince Emygdius to worship Jupiter and the goddess Angaria, the patroness of Ascoli. Polymius also offered him the hand of his daughter Polisia. Instead Emygdius baptized her as a Christian in the waters of the Tronto, along with many others.\\n\\nEnraged, Polymius decapitated him on the spot now occupied by the Sant'Emidio Red Temple, as well as his followers Eupolus (Euplus), Germanus, and Valentius (Valentinus). Emygdius stood up, carried his own head to a spot on a mountain where he had constructed an oratory (the site of the present-day Sant'Emidio alla Grotte). After Emygdius' martyrdom, his followers attacked Polymius' palace and pulled it down.\\n\\nHis hagiography was written probably by a monk of Frankish origin in the eleventh century, after the rediscovery of the saint's relics, which had been conserved in a Roman sarcophagus. However, his hagiography was attributed to his disciple Valentius, who was martyred with him. The cult of Saint Emygdius is ancient, documented by churches dedicated to him since the eighth century. The translation of his relics from the catacomb of Sant'Emidio alla Grotte to the crypt of the cathedral happened probably around the year 1000 under Bernardo II, bishop of Ascoli. \\n\\nIn 1703, a violent earthquake occurred in the Marche but did not affect the city of Ascoli Piceno. The city's salvation was attributed to Emygdius and he was thenceforth invoked against earthquakes. As a result of this event, the church dedicated a church to the saint in 1717. Additionally, many towns appointed him as patron, erecting statues in his honor in the churches (L'Aquila, 1732; Cingoli, 1747; San Ginesio, 1751; and Nocera Umbra, 1751). \\n\\nEmygdius is considered to have protected Ascoli from other dangers. A dazzling vision of Emygdius is said to have deterred Alaric I from destroying Ascoli in 409. The troops of Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor passed through the region in 1038 carrying the plague; Bernardo I, bishop of Ascoli, invoked Emydgius' aid and the plague stopped. During World War II, on October 3, 1943, Emygdius is said to have protected the city against German movements against the Italian partisans.\\n\\n"}

Its population is about 800.\\n\\nIn 1959, a Bronze Age tomb was discovered here placing the village at over 3000 years old. Unfortunately for historians, the urn and other artifacts found were inadvertently destroyed when the tomb was being excavated.\\n\\nThe name 'Scairbh na gCaorach' (the Irish language name for Emyvale) means 'crossing of the sheep', referring to a low (and easily traversable) point in the Mountain Water river on which Emyvale is situated. The name is thought to have come from the Ui Meith tribe, the village's first inhabitants. Scairbh na gCaorach was abbreviated to \"Scarna\" in the early part of the 19th Century (indeed a local hostelry bears this name), although this fell out of common usage, and village is now referred to by its English language name; Emyvale.\\n\\nIn the 8th century, the McKenna Clan arrived, and by the 12th century they had established an independent túath or kingdom in North Monaghan, which would last for the next 450 years.\\n\\nIn more recent times, Emyvale was immortalised by the renowned nineteenth-century Irish writer William Carleton as part of his \"Traits and Stories of The Irish Peasantry\" series.

The enTourage eDGe has a SD card slot for transferring owned e-books or music to the device, a camera located above the LCD screen, and two full-sized USB ports where external flash drives, an external keyboard and other compatible devices may be used. The eDGe includes a stylus pen to write and interact with both the LCD and e-Ink screens. The two halves of the device can be folded closed much like a paper book, but can also be turned outwards so the screens are back to back.\\n\\nThe enTourage eDGe has received mixed reviews.

Enchiladas can be filled with a variety of ingredients, including meat, cheese, beans, potatoes, vegetables, seafood or combinations.\\n\\nThe Real Academia Española defines the word enchilada, as used in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua, as a rolled maize tortilla stuffed with meat and covered with a tomato and chile sauce. Enchilada is the past participle of Spanish enchilar, \"to add chile pepper to,\" literally to \"season (or decorate) with chile.\"\\n\\nEnchiladas originated in Mexico. The people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by Hernán Cortés in Coyoacán, which included foods served in corn tortillas. (Note that the native Nahuatl name for the flat corn bread used was tlaxcalli; the Spanish give it the name tortilla.) In the nineteenth century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, El cocinero mexicano (\"The Mexican Chef\"), published in 1831, and in Mariano Galvan Rivera's Diccionario de Cocina, published in 1845.\\n\\nIn their original form as Mexican street food, enchiladas were simply corn tortillas dipped in chili sauce and eaten without fillings. They now have taken many varieties, which are distinguished primarily by their sauces, fillings and, in one instance, by their form. Various adjectives may be used to describe the recipe content or origin, e.g. enchilada tapatia would be a recipe from Jalisco.\\n\\nVarieties include:\\n\\nFillings include meat, such as chicken, beef or pork, seafood, cheese, potatoes, vegetables, and any combination of these.

{"title": "Encyclopedia Brown", "body": "Leroy \"Encyclopedia\" Brown is a the main character in a long series of children's novels written by Donald J. Sobol since 1963.\\n\\nEach book in the Encyclopedia Brown mystery series is self-contained in that the reader is not required to have read earlier books in order to understand the stories. The major characters, settings, etc. are usually introduced (or reintroduced) in each book.\\n\\nBooks featuring Brown are subdivided into a number—usually ten or more—of (possibly interlinked) short stories, each of which presents a mystery. The mysteries are intended to be solved by the reader, thanks to the placement of a logical or factual inconsistency somewhere within the text. This is very similar to the layout of Donald Sobol's other book series: \"Two-Minute Mysteries\". Brown invariably solves the case by exposing this inconsistency, in the \"Answers\" section in the back of the book.\\n\\nOften these books follow a formula where the first chapter involves Brown solving a case at the dinner table for his father, the local police chief in the fictional town of Idaville. Encyclopedia solves these cases by briefly closing his eyes while he thinks deeply, then asking a single question which directly leads to him finding the solution.\\n\\nThe second mystery often begins in the Brown garage on Rover Avenue, where Encyclopedia has set up his own detective agency to help neighborhood children solve cases for \"25 cents per day, plus expenses.\" This second case usually involves the town bully and mischief maker, Bugs Meany, leader of a gang who call themselves the Tigers, who, after being foiled, will attempt revenge in the third mystery.\\n\\nIn the third mystery the plot involves Encyclopedia's partner, close friend and bodyguard, Sally Kimball, the one person under twelve years of age to physically stand up to Bugs. She is the only reason neither Bugs nor any of his Tigers ever try to physically attack Encyclopedia. Encyclopedia tends to dislike anyone that she has a crush on, possibly indicating that he has a crush on her. Also intelligent, she once attempted to prove herself smarter than Encyclopedia by stumping him with a mystery of her own creation. However, she was beaten in the contest (although Encyclopedia admitted that she almost tricked him), after which she became his friend. In that story Bugs or his gang usually sets up some sort of trap to get Encyclopedia or Sally in trouble. However, like in the previous story they make a key mistake which Encyclopedia exposes. \\n\\nLater cases may find Encyclopedia assisting his father at a crime scene (rarely more serious than larceny, and Encyclopedia is always discreet when helping his father) or interacting with people around town, often exposing scams. One such example is a high school dropout and would-be con artist named Wilford Wiggins who spends time trying to dream up schemes to fleece kids out of their money. Like Bugs, his schemes have an inconsistency which Encyclopedia exposes.\\n\\nIn some cases it is Sally and not Encyclopedia who figures it out because in her words, \"You are a boy.\" In other words she notices things that only a female would find inconsistent. Sally further displays her intelligence in the various mysteries in that she often can deduce who committed the crime, or whether a certain person is lying, but she simply cannot always prove it. \\n\\nOther recurring characters in the books include:\\n\\nOthers:\\n\\nThe Encyclopedia Brown books experienced some enduring popularity. In 1975, the Mystery Writers of America honored Sobol and his Encyclopedia Brown series with a special Edgar Award.\\n\\nThe books were originally published by Thomas Nelson Inc. and later, by Lodestar Books. They were also published by Scholastic Inc. and Bantam Books through arrangement with those publishers. The current publishing rights are held by Bantam Books. Current editions of the books feature new illustrations in place of the originals by Leonard Shortall, updated to contemporary cultural styles.\\n\\nEncyclopedia Brown inspired many other crack-the-mystery-yourself mystery stories for younger readers, such as \"Einstein\" Anderson, and Hawkeye Collins &amp; Amy Adams.\\n\\nA TV series of Encyclopedia Brown premiered on Home Box Office (HBO) in 1989 with 30-minute episodes. Scott Bremner played the title role, with Laura Bridge playing Sally.

{"title": "Energy Northwest", "body": "Energy Northwest (formerly Washington Public Power Supply System) is a United States public power joint operating agency formed by State law in 1957 to produce at-cost power for Northwest utilities.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Richland, Washington, and originally named the Washington Public Power Supply System, the agency was renamed Energy Northwest in November 1998. Agency membership includes 28 public power utilities, including 23 of the State’s 24 public utility districts.\\n\\nEnergy Northwest is governed by two boards: an executive board and a board of directors. The executive board has 11 members: five representatives from the board of directors, three gubernatorial appointees and three public representatives selected by the board of directors. The board of directors includes a representative from each member utility.\\n\\nThe consortium’s solar, hydro, wind and nuclear projects deliver nearly 1,300 megawatts of electricity to the Northwest power grid. Current power projects include White Bluffs Solar Station, Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project, Nine Canyon Wind Project and Columbia Generating Station nuclear power plant.\\n\\nEnergy Northwest functions as a municipal corporation, similar to a town or city. That legal status allows the agency to issue public bonds to raise the financial capital necessary to build additional power generating and other public utility facilities.\\n\\nNew power generating facilities currently under consideration include additional wind power sites throughout Washington; a 320-megawatt natural gas plant in Kalama, Washington; a carbonless energy park in eastern Washington; and three solar projects in Oregon at 5-megawatts each. The agency also provides a variety of business services in the energy, power generation and technical fields, including a range of project management and facility operations and maintenance services. \\n\\nIn April 2006, Energy Northwest achieved ISO 14001:2004 registration, formalizing its environment stewardship program.\\n\\nThe public power movement gained prominence in the 1920s and 1930s under the leadership of the Washington State Grange, a non-partisan, grassroots advocacy group for rural citizens with both legislative programs and community activities. Public utility districts were created to provide reliable, low-cost power for the growing state.\\n\\nOn Jan. 31, 1957, the state legislature created the Washington Public Power Supply System, now known as Energy Northwest, as a joint operating agency to share the risks and rewards of building and operating electrical generating facilities. The power was to be provided, at the cost of production, to the ratepayers of those public utilities participating in the agency’s new projects.\\n\\nThe first generating source to be developed was the Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project, located in Lewis County, Wash., approximately 20 miles south of Mount Rainier. The 27.5 megawatt project was designed to produce electricity while protecting the natural environment. Packwood continues to produce power into its fifth decade of operation. In February 2008, Energy Northwest submitted an application to renew the project’s operating license for an additional 50 years to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The agency expects to receive a license renewal for the project in 2010.\\n\\nIn September 1962, Congress passed and President John F. Kennedy signed a bill authorizing construction of a new dual-purpose nuclear reactor (the N Reactor) on the Hanford nuclear reservation. It was designed to produce both weapons-grade plutonium and steam to power turbine generators – thus its designation as a dual-purpose reactor. With support from U.S. Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson, the agency made a successful pitch to be the non-federal operator of the steam generator half of the project. President Kennedy presided over the groundbreaking in September 1963. Commercial operation of the 860-megawatt Hanford Generating Project began in April 1966.\\n\\nFor the agency, under the regionally developed Hydro-Thermal Power Program, the 1970s brought the challenge of attempting to simultaneously construct multiple nuclear power plants. Of the five nuclear power projects started, only one – WNP-2, now known as Columbia Generating Station, was completed. A combination of management failures, a depressed economy, soaring interest rates and material costs, labor unrest, ratepayer activism and over estimation of electricity demand by forecasters was more than the effort could withstand. The other plants were eventually terminated.\\n\\nIn 1983, it became infamous for defaulting on $2.25 billion USD worth of bonds after construction on two of its nuclear power plants, WNP-4 and 5, was halted. The default remains the largest municipal bond default in the history of the United States, acquiring the nickname \"whoops\" in the financial media.[1]\\n\\nFuel loading at Columbia Generating Station began on Dec. 25, 1983, and proceeded at a rate of 50 fuel assemblies per day. The process was completed Jan. 12, 1984, and Columbia was declared in commercial operation Dec. 13, 1984. On Jan 19, 2010, Energy Northwest submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license renewal of Columbia Generating Station. The current license will expire near the end of 2023. License renewal is a NRC process that takes approximately 2½ years from the application submittal date.\\n\\nThe end of the Cold War brought a sudden reduction in the need for plutonium for defense purposes. In February 1988, the N Reactor was closed indefinitely. With no steam, Hanford Generating Project lost its source of energy to spin the turbine generators and closed after 20 years in operation.\\n\\nThe agency built and continues to operate White Bluffs Solar Station demonstration project, which was dedicated in May 2002. The low-maintenance, environmentally friendly project uses 242 photovoltaic panels to reach a production capacity of 38.7 kilowatts DC.\\n\\nEnergy Northwest next built and continues to operate the region’s first public power wind project – Nine Canyon Wind Project. It was dedicated in October 2002, with a second phase going online in December 2003, and the third and final phase in service in May 2008, bringing the total capacity to 95.9 megawatts.\\n\\nAsotin County PUD, Benton County PUD, Centralia City Light, Chelan County PUD, City of Port Angeles, City of Richland, Clallam County PUD, Clark Public Utilities, Cowlitz County PUD, Ferry County PUD, Franklin County PUD, Grant County PUD, Grays Harbor County PUD, Jefferson County PUD, Kittitas County PUD, Klickitat County PUD, Lewis County PUD, Mason County PUD 1, Mason County PUD 3, Okanogan County PUD, Pacific County PUD 2, Pend Oreille PUD, Seattle City Light, Skamania County PUD, Snohomish County PUD, Tacoma Public Utilities, Wahkiakum County PUD, Whatcom County PUD\\n\\n  \\n\\n"}

While the officers were on strike, some of their duties were performed by National Guardsmen who were activated. At Mid-Orange Correctional Facility (and other facilities) striking employees were evicted from employee housing which was then used to house some of the National Guard. Two of the evicted officers at Mid-Orange C.F., Marianne E. Engblom and Charles E. Palmer, subsequently filed suit against the state of New York and its governor, Hugh L. Carey.\\n\\nRendered on May 3, 1982, the decision established that the National Guardsmen legally qualify as soldiers under the Third Amendment, that the amendment applies to state as well as federal authorities, and that the protection of this amendment extends beyond home owners. The majority stated that the officers' occupancy in the rooms was covered under the legal rules of \"tenancy\" and was protected under the Third amendment.\\n\\nThe case was remanded to district court where it was decided in the defendants' favor, due to the principle that as agents of the state, the defendants were covered by a qualified immunity unless they were knowingly acting illegally. In the absence of previous precedents on this issue, the standard of knowing illegality was not met.\\n\\nThere was a dissenting judge who claimed that the officers' occupancy was covered under the lesser protection of employee housing and that the special circumstances of residency on prison grounds superseded Third Amendment protection.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Enhanced Machine Controller", "body": "Enhanced Machine Controller, or EMC2, is a FLOSS GNU/Linux software system to implement Numerical control capability using general purpose computers to control machines. It is developed by a number of volunteer developers at LinuxCNC.Org\\n\\nEMC2 is a software system for numerical control of machines such as milling machines, lathes, plasma cutters, routers, cutting machines, robots, hexapods, etc. It can control up to 9 axes or joints of a CNC machine using G-code (RS-274NGC) as input. It has several GUIs suited to specific kinds of usage (touch screen, interactive development).Currently it is almost exclusively used on X86 PC platforms, but a couple ports to other architectures are in use (Alpha, Sparc). It makes extensive use of a Real Time-modified kernel, and supports both stepper- and servo-type drives.\\n\\nEMC was originally developed by NIST, as a reference implementation of the industry standard language for numerical control of machining operations, RS-274D (G-code).The software included the RS274 interpreter driving the motion trajectory planner, real-time motor/actuator drivers and a user interface. It demonstrated the feasibility of an advanced numerical control system using off the shelf PC hardware running Linux, interfacing to various hardware motion control systems.\\n\\nThe demonstration project was very successful and created a community of users and volunteer contributors. Sometime around 2000 these volunteers took the EMC project to the next stage:relocated it to sourceforge.net under the Public Domain license. In 2003 the community rewrote some parts of it, reorganized and cleaned up the rest, and gave it the new name, EMC2. EMC2 is still being actively developed. Licensing is under the GNU General Public License.\\n\\nA major change, prompting the new name EMC2, was to split trajectory and motion planning from the motion hardware, and interpose a new layer known as HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to interconnect functions easily without altering C code or recompiling. This opened up a whole range of new possibilities, and made it much easier to support gantry machines, lathe threading and rigid tapping, and a variety of other adaptations. HAL comes with some interactive tools to examine signals, connect and remove links and a virtual oscilloscope to examine signals in real time.Also, Classic Ladder (an open-source ladder logic implementation) was adapted for the real time environment for configuring complex auxiliary devices like automatic tool changers.\\n\\nDue to the need of fine grained, precise real time control of machines in motion, EMC requires a platform with Real time capabilities. It uses Linux kernel with real time extensions (RTAI or RTLinux). Installing emc2 (and the underlying real time extension) is a daunting task, therefore prebuilt binary packages have been built and are being distributed. The policy for emc2 is to build packages and offer support on Ubuntu LTS (long term support) releases.\\n\\nEMC2 uses a software layer called HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer). \\n\\nHAL allows a multitude of configurations to be built  while being flexible: one can mix & match various hardware control boards, output control signals through the Parallel port or Serial port - while driving stepper or servo motors, solenoids and other actuators.\\n\\nEMC2 also includes a software Programmable logic controller which is usually used in extensive configurations (e.g. complex machining centers). The software PLC is based on the opensource project Classicladder, and runs within the real-time environment.\\n\\n"}

Prior to these achievements, she was best known as the wife of the Premier of Tasmania and later Prime Minister of Australia, Joseph Lyons.\\n\\nLyons was born Enid Muriel Burnell in Smithton, Tasmania, and educated at the Teacher's Training College, Hobart and later became a school teacher. In 1913, when she was 15, she met Joseph Lyons, then a young Labor politician, and married him in 1915. They had twelve children, one of whom died in infancy.\\n\\nIn 1929 Joseph, who had been Labor Premier of Tasmania from 1923 to 1928, entered federal politics as member for the Division of Wilmot. In 1931 he left the Labor Party and became leader of the United Australia Party (UAP) and at the beginning of 1932 became Prime Minister. Enid and her children moved into The Lodge in Canberra, and she became an extremely popular political spouse.\\n\\nShe was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the Coronation Honours of 1936. Joseph died in 1939, aged 59, the first Australian Prime Minister to die in office, and Dame Enid returned to Tasmania. She bitterly resented Joseph Lyons's successor as leader of the UAP, Robert Menzies, who she believed had betrayed her husband by resigning from the Cabinet, shortly before Joseph's death. \\n\\nleft thumb left At the 1943 election Dame Enid Lyons won the Division of Darwin in north-western Tasmania for the UAP, becoming the first woman in the House of Representatives. At the same election, Dorothy Tangney (later Dame Dorothy) was elected as a Labor Senator for Western Australia, the nation's first woman Senator. In 1945 the UAP became the Liberal Party of Australia.\\n\\nAs a Roman Catholic from Australia's most provincial state, Enid Lyons had always had a conservative streak, despite her husband's Labor roots. By the time she was elected to Parliament in her own right, there was very little left of her Labor ties. Her speeches in Parliament generally espoused traditional views on the family and other social issues.\\n\\nIn 1949 the Liberals came to power under Menzies' leadership. Their frosty personal relations thawed very slightly when Menzies appointed Lyons Vice-President of the Executive Council, a largely honorary post which gave her a seat in Cabinet but no departmental duties. But her health, always delicate, declined under the strain of regular travel between Canberra and Tasmania, and she retired at the 1951 election. \\n\\nIn retirement, Dame Enid Lyons's health recovered.

{"title": "Enigmo", "body": "Enigmo and Enigmo 2 are respectively 2D and 3D arcade-style computer game for PC, Mac OS X, iOS and the PlayStation developed by Pangea Software. They both involve moving certain substances into their proper containers. The music in both games was recorded by Michael Beckett.\\n\\nEnigmo was created in 2003 by Pangea Software and was their most successful game ever sold at the time. It leaves behind the action-adventure genre in favor of a puzzle style. The graphics are three dimensional, in a sense; but gameplay is strictly limited to the horizontal and vertical axes. Liquids (water, oil, and lava) fall from \"droppers\" and will bounce around the walls of a mechanism. Gameplay consists of manipulating a limited number of dynamic items (such as bumpers, sliders, accelerators, and sponges) to affect various streams of flowing liquid so that the droplets reach their destination: \"tanks\" specific for each liquid. The player wins the level when all tanks on the level are filled with 50 drops of the appropriate liquid. In addition to the pre-designed levels, players can create their own using the game's built-in editor and download others for free off of the Pangea website.\\n\\nIn 2004, Aspyr Media ported a 2003 release of Enigmo to the Windows Mobile platform. This version was included with the Dell Axim x50v model PDA; the software is available for purchase from Dell and appears to be limited to the x50v model.\\n\\nIn January 2011, a version of Enigmo is set to be released in the PlayStation Store as a PSP Mini. It will be developed and published by Beatshapers.\\n\\nEnigmo 2 was introduced in February 2006, and expands upon the basic principles set down by the original. Water is still a substance that can be manipulated, but lava and oil were swapped for laser beams and plasma particles. The game adds the dimension of depth to gameplay, and many solutions involving rotating the camera or objects in three dimensions. The graphics were also improved. The game takes place in outer space, specifically near Earth, Mars, Saturn, and asteroid, but gravity functions like it would on earth. Like the original, each container must have 50 units to be considered \"full\". When all containers are simultaneously full (they lose their contents over time), the player wins the level.\\n\\nDuring WWDC 2008, it was announced that an iOS version of Enigmo was in development and would be available for purchase for the price of US$9.99 at the launch of the App Store. The game makes use of the iPhone's multi touch interface and is controlled entirely via touch. Players can use the swiping and pinching actions to zoom and pan and use their fingers to position the puzzle pieces. The game has been a success; it was voted the \"Best iPhone Game\" at WWDC '08 and has been met with very positive reviews in the App Store. Originally including only 50 levels, Enigmo has been updated to allow user designed levels created on the desktop versions of the game; the price was dropped to US$4.99 at that time. It was then dropped to US$1.99 on October 8, 2008 and later to US$0.99 for Black Friday. It is currently on sale for $0.99.Enigmo for iPhone and iPod Touch are now available in Dutch, German, Spanish, Japanese, Italian, and French. JR Language Translations provided the localisation of the game to Pangea Software.\\n\\nOn September 2, 2009, Pangea Software released Enigmo 2 for the iPhone. It is very similar to the Mac OS X version, although it uses multi-touch to control. On September 24, it was updated to support the Retina Display and the iPad. It currently cost $2.99 and is available from the App Store. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Enrolled Missouri Militia", "body": "The Enrolled Missouri Militia was a state militia organization of Missouri in 1862 during the American Civil War. It was a part-time force whose primary purpose was to serve as garrison and infrastructure guards, both to augment the Unionist Missouri State Militia in defense versus raids and to free the Missouri State Militia for offensive operations versus Confederate guerrillas and recruiters.\\n\\nIn Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War, volunteer Unionist Home Guard regiments were formed with the blessing of Federal authorities to oppose secessionist Governor Claiborne Jackson's militia and his intent to deny Missouri enlistments into Federal service. Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon was given authority by the War Department to organize the Home Guard on June 11, 1861. \\n\\nBy late 1861 most of the Home Guard regiments had been disbanded. They were replaced by a smaller Six-month Militia under state rather than Federal control. This too was disbanded in January 1862, to be replaced by the Missouri State Militia (almost entirely cavalry.) \\n\\nFollowing the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas and the resulting Confederate withdrawal from northern Arkansas, recruiters were dispatched throughout Missouri in an attempt to rebuild the Confederate forces. Southern guerrillas aided the recruiters and often fought alongside them.\\n\\nGuerrilla warfare plagued Missouri from the start of the conflict in Missouri, but intensified in early 1862 as the weather warmed.  To combat the growing guerrilla menace General Henry W. Halleck issued General Order Number 2 on March 13:\\n\\nConfederate President Jefferson Davis responded on April 21, 1862 attempted to legitimize guerrilla warfare by authorizing commissions for those forming bands of “partisan rangers.”  This was not accepted by the United States authorities. On May 29 Brigadier General John Schofield responded with General Order No. 18 to the Missouri State Militia which read in part:  \\n\\nAs guerrilla warfare and recruiting increased, and as the state had been stripped of nearly all but the volunteer Missouri State Militia Cavalry regiments, General Schofield took a more drastic measure. With the aid of Missouri’s provisional Governor Hamilton Rowan Gamble, a compulsory militia enrollment was declared on July 22, 1862, the Enrolled Missouri Militia.  Schofield issued General Orders No. 19 requiring loyal men to enroll in the militia, required registration of all who had previously taken up arms against the United States, and for them to surrender their weapons. The disloyal and sympathizers would not be required to enroll in the militia, but would of course have to declare their sympathies.\\n\\nThe new Enrolled Missouri Militia could be called up in time of emergency to garrison key points in their locale or even to disrupt guerrilla encampments nearby. Many were not provided with uniforms and soon after their formation would rely on white hatbands as a form of identification. \\n\\nWhile these orders did raise a militia force for garrison duty and local policing that freed the Missouri State Militia for active pursuit of guerrillas and recruiters, the policies also forced those of Southern loyalties to choose sides. Thousands chose the brush, guerrilla bands, or to seek out recruiters to join the Southern army.  \\n\\nConfederate recruiters such as John A. Poindexter and Joseph C. Porter in northeast Missouri would immediately benefit from the order as their numbers were soon swelled by disaffected Southerners. For a time the Enrolled Militia enrollment appeared counterproductive, but within a month both of their forces had been beaten and scattered after defeats at Moore's Mill, the Battle of Kirksville, and at Compton's Ferry. The new Enrolled Militia regiments increased the Union presence throughout the state while the Missouri State Militia drove out the recruiters and their regiments. Despite this, approximately 5,000 Southerners did succeed in making their way from northern Missouri to the Confederate army in Arkansas. \\n\\nIt was more difficult for the Union to reassert control in western Missouri south of the Missouri River. Upton Hays, John Hughes, Jerry Coffee, Jeremiah \"Vard\" Cockrell, and Jo Shelby were all busy recruiting Confederate regiments during this same period. They were aided by William Quantrill's guerrillas. At the First Battle of Independence Hays, Hughes, and Quantrill succeeded in capturing Independence and its garrison (a battalion of the 7th Missouri Cavalry.) Hays, Cockrell, and Coffee then defeated another force at the Battle of Lone Jack. The newly recruited Confederate commands were able to withdraw intact to Arkansas.\\n\\nWith the withdrawal of the recruiters, the major crisis in Missouri had passed. Guerrilla warfare and raids would continue but would never reach the peak that occurred in the Summer of 1862.\\n\\nSince the enrolled militia were called up locally as needed and uniforms were not provided, they did not create an unmanageable financial burden. The formation of the Enrolled Missouri Militia was an arrangement between Schofield and Gamble that had not received the full consent of the Federal authorities. As a result only a few would later be eligible for Federal pensions. \\n\\nThere were also problems of reliability and loyalty. Some of the units were composed primarily of Southern leaning men and officers. As a result some companies were disbanded. Eventually yet another organization, the Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia, would be formed from the more reliable militia.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Enter the Matrix", "body": "Enter the Matrix is the first video game based on ''The Matrix'' series of films. It was developed by Shiny Entertainment and published by Atari and WB Interactive for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube game systems, and for the PC. It sold one million copies in its first eighteen days of release, 2.5 million over the first six weeks, and eventually 5 million copies. Enter the Matrix was simultaneously produced with The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions films.\\n\\nFirst released on 15 May 2003, the same day as The Matrix Reloadeds North American release, Enter the Matrix gives players control of two of the supporting characters in that film, Ghost and Niobe, members of the same group of rebels as Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo. Niobe is the Captain of the Logos, the fastest ship in the rebel fleet. Ghost is the ship's first mate and weapons guru, and is a deep-thinking, philosophical assassin. The game takes place at roughly the same time as the events in The Matrix Reloaded; a character may walk out of a scene in the film, only to walk into a scene in the game. Like the films, the game features martial arts, firefights, driving, and bullet-time. It also includes a \"hacking system\" that simulates the ability to hack into the Matrix by way of a simplified mimicry of DOS, exploring and unlocking secrets, weapons, maps, and skills.\\n\\nEnter the Matrix was designed, like The Animatrix, to be an integral part of the Matrix series. Many previous movies have been adapted as games, but in this case, the game expands upon the story told in the films. Enter the Matrix includes two hours of live action 35mm film footage written and directed specifically for the game by the Wachowski brothers (and later included as part of \"The Ultimate Matrix Collection\" on the \"The Matrix Reloaded Revisited\" DVD). The martial arts moves and in-engine cutscenes of the game feature actions captured directly from the films' actors and stunt double to recreate their unique fighting styles while suspended from wires under the supervision of the series' fight scene choreographer Yuen Wo Ping.\\n\\nThe player learns that Neo is not the only target of Persephone's predilection toward trading kisses for esoteric information; Niobe and Ghost are both put into positions where they must submit to her whims in order to gain critical information that she offers them in return for their favors. Significant also to the continuity of the Matrix universe is the first appearance of actress Mary Alice in the role of the Oracle. (Gloria Foster, the original actress, died of complications related to diabetes early on in the production of both The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions). The game includes a film sequence specifically explaining her change of appearance, as a result of an attack on her by the Merovingian, a malevolent character introduced in The Matrix Reloaded, who also appears in the game. Another film sequence reveals that the Merovingian's attack was facilitated by a sacrificial trade with the compassionate program Rama-Kandra. Allowed to occur by the Oracle, the Merovingian acquired the deletion codes for the Oracle's external \"shell,\" and in exchange, he gave Rama-Kandra's daughter Sati her freedom and safety in the Matrix, despite her lack of purpose in the machine world, though the Oracle foreshadows that Sati will play an important role in both the Matrix and the Real. What role Sati will play is yet to be determined in The Matrix Online.\\n\\nThe story begins with Niobe, captain of the Logos, and Ghost, her first mate, retrieving a package left in the Matrix by the crew of the recently destroyed rebel ship Osiris. After being pursued by Agents, Ghost and Niobe escape from the Matrix with the package.\\n\\nThe package is a message to the human city Zion, warning them that the machines are tunneling to Zion with an army of Sentinels. Niobe and Ghost are tasked with calling the rest of the ships back to Zion to coordinate a defense.\\n\\nWith everyone home, the captains of the various ships hold a meeting in the Matrix to decide on how best to defend themselves. During the meeting, Agents attack the building they are in. Niobe and Ghost help the humans escape; when everyone is safe except them, the Keymaker, a program capable of accessing any area in the Matrix, leads them to safety through a door that he created.\\n\\nThe Keymaker gives the two a key that they are supposed to give to Neo, the protagonist of the film trilogy. However, the key is stolen by henchmen of the Merovingian, a program created during the early days of the Matrix who now is a crime boss in the Matrix. As Niobe and Ghost pursue them, the character that the player did not choose is captured by more henchmen. Before the player character rescues the one captured, the Merovingian destroys the key that the Keymaker gave them. They then escape from the Matrix.\\n\\nNiobe later volunteers to go find the Nebuchadnezzar, the ship that is captained by Morpheus and that carries Neo. Upon finding them and helping them escape from the Matrix, they agree to help in Neo's mission against the machines, as depicted in The Matrix Reloaded.\\n\\nAfter this mission is completed, the Oracle, a program that often gives the humans advice, requests that the player character come and speak to her. After their conversation, the player is confronted by Smith, a rogue agent that seeks to destroy both the human and machine worlds. The player character barely escapes from Smith and the Matrix.\\n\\nOnce out, the Logos is attacked by the machines. They defeat the machines by setting off an EMP, which disables their ship in the process. The game ends with the two of them waiting in the Logos to be rescued.\\n\\nAside from Ghost and Niobe, there are numerous secondary characters in Enter The Matrix.\\n\\nA CD release of the soundtrack accompanied the video game, with compositions by Don Davis and Erik Lundborg.\\n\\nOther musical groups, such as Evanescence, Fluke, Clawfinger, and Celldweller, are featured in the game and are credited in the game's booklet.\\n\\nThe album jackets for The Matrix Reloaded: The Album and The Matrix Revolutions: Music from the Motion Picture contain hidden codes for Enter The Matrix (not just the one code given for Infinite Ammo displayed clearly inside the Reloaded jacket). These other codes can be seen almost blending into the pictures from the films.\\n\\nDespite the heavy hype surrounding the Matrix movie franchise, the game was generally met by mixed reviews from critics. Metacritic reported that the game had an average mark of 62 out of 100. Two critics from Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it \"bad\" scores; another later admitted that his \"average\" score for the game was too high. Mark MacDonald's comments were especially scathing:\\n\\nGameSpot listed Enter the Matrix in several of their \"Dubious Honors\" lists at the end of 2003, including their five most disappointing titles of the year. One common complaint was that players wanted to play as trilogy protagonist Neo rather than secondary characters Ghost and Niobe, an issue Shiny Entertainment addressed with their later Matrix game Path of Neo.\\n\\nSteven Poole, in his column in Edge, described Enter the Matrix as \"Max Payne with celebrity scriptwriters,\" and said that the films' fluid fight choreography could not be matched by the game's control system, and that the game's centred view, while practical, was not as interesting as the \"kinetic montage\" of camera angles used in the movies' action scenes. He also expressed other concerns:\\n\\nPositive comments came from IGN and Nintendo Power, with NP giving it an 82/100 and stating \"Its game play suffers from repetition, but this two-disc technomelange has tons of great stuff for \"Matrix\" fans. IGN's review, while mixed, gave praise to its presentation and sound. They stated that \"You can't get much better than having the Wachowski Brothers filming your cutscenes\", and \"Kudos to the sound team for bringing the movie audio to life in the game. Excellent sound design, and a great score.\"\\n\\nPeer Schneider of IGN has also given positive comments, saying that:\\n\\nHe also gave praise to the GCN version, specifically:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Entertainment Computer System", "body": "The Entertainment Computer System was an add-on peripheral for the Intellivision. It was Mattel Electronics' second attempt at creating a peripheral to upgrade the Intellivision into a home computer, rushed into production to appease the Federal Trade Commission after they began fining Mattel for false advertising following consumer complaints about the repeated delays in releasing the originally-planned Intellivision Keyboard Component add-on.\\n\\nWhen Mattel Electronics originally released the Intellivision in late 1979, they advertised that the Intellivision — unlike its primary rival, the Atari 2600 (then known as the Atari VCS) — would be upgradeable to a fully-functional home computer via a hardware add-on accessory called the Keyboard Component. Many potential buyers were excited by the notion (especially parents, who liked the idea of a machine that could be turned into an educational tool, or at least something more useful and practical than just a game-playing system), and many bought Intellivisions on that basis alone.\\n\\nThe planned Keyboard Component would have offered a 16K of RAM (expandable to an unprecedented 8 megabytes), built-in cassette storage for programs and data (plus a simultaneous audio track that could be played under computer control), an optional 40-column thermal printer, and a secondary CPU to run all of these expanded features independently of the Intellivision's CP1610 processor. Unfortunately, while the planned Keyboard Component was an ambitious design, it had some reliability problems that proved difficult to overcome, and it was far too expensive to manufacture and sell. The Keyboard Component — originally planned for a 1981 release — was continually delayed and pushed back as Mattel's engineering group, headed by David \"Papa Intellivision\" Chandler, kept going back to the drawing board trying to find ways to overcome these problems.\\n\\nEventually, complaints from Intellivision owners who had chosen to buy the Intellivision specifically on the promise of a \"Coming Soon!\" personal-computer upgrade caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which launched an investigation of Mattel Electronics for fraud and false advertising. Mattel tried to claim that the Keyboard Component was a real product that was still being test-marketed, and even released a small number of Keyboard Components and a handful of software titles to a few select retail stores (as well as offering them via mail-order to any customers who complained loudly enough) in order to support this claim. The FTC was not impressed and finally, in mid-1982, they imposed a fine of $10,000 per day until the promised computer upgrade was in full retail distribution. \\n\\nFortunately, Mattel Electronics already had a \"plan B\" in progress. Increasingly concerned that the Keyboard Component division might never actually produce a sellable product, in mid-1981 Mattel Electronics' management set up a competing internal engineering team headed by Richard Chang. Ostensibly, this group was working on a low-cost add-on called the BASIC Development System, or BDS, which would be sold as an educational device to introduce kids to the concepts of computer programming via a simplified color-coded BASIC interpreter and an inexpensive keyboard. Only a few people within Mattel knew the team's real mission: to either fix the Keyboard Component, or replace it.\\n\\nChang's \"Design & Development\" group (who had to keep the project's real purpose a closely-guarded secret among themselves, fearing that if Chandler found out about it he would use his influence at Mattel, Inc. to get the project killed) eventually came up with an alternative to the Keyboard Component. Originally dubbed the Lucky (from LUCKI: Low User-Cost Keyboard Interface), it lacked many of the sophisticated features envisioned for the original Keyboard Component: instead of a full 16K of RAM, it only offered a mere 2K (not all of which was actually available to the user); the cassette interface was stripped down to the bare essential needed to save and load data (and was now an optional extra, rather than built-in), and there was no secondary CPU. Still, it fulfilled the original promises—turn the Intellivision into a computer, make it possible to write programs and store them to tape, and interface with a printer—well enough to allow Mattel to claim that they had delivered the promised computer upgrade and, it was hoped, to get the FTC and its $10,000/day fine off Mattel's back. \\n\\nOn the plus side, the ECS did include a built-in BASIC that was somewhat functional, if idiosyncratic and occasionally buggy, and a second AY-3-8910 sound chip which expanded the system's audio capabilities to six-voice synthesized sound and, when paired with the optional 49-key Music Synthesizer keyboard, could potentially turn the Intellivision into a polyphonic synthesizer for playing, recording, or learning music. It would also allow two additional hand-held Game Controllers to be connected in place of the alphanumeric keyboard, which opened up the possibility of four-player games. \\n\\nIn the fall of 1982, the LUCKI—now renamed the Entertainment Computer System, or ECS—was presented at the annual sales meeting, officially signaling the end of the ill-fated Keyboard Component project. (Although it didn't go quietly. Not only did Mattel have to agree to buy back all of the existing Keyboard Components, but the manufacturer which had been contracted to make the Keyboards (Compro, Inc.) promptly sued Mattel for $10 million dollars claiming breach of contract, fraud, and nonpayment for the last 1,300 units.) A new advertising campaign was hastily rushed onto the air in time for the 1982 Christmas season, promising once again that a home-computer upgrade was just around the corner, and the ECS itself was shown to the public at the January 1983 Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas. A few months later, the ECS hit the market, and the FTC agreed to drop the $10K/day fines.\\n\\nUnfortunately, by the time the ECS made its retail debut, an internal shake-up at the top levels of Mattel Electronics' management had caused the company's focus to shift away from hardware add-ons in favor of software, and the ECS received very little further marketing push. Further hardware developments, including a planned Program Expander that would have added another 16K of RAM and a more sophisticated, fully-featured Extended-BASIC to the system, were halted, and in the end only a half-dozen titles were released for the ECS.\\n\\n(Note: the latter two options were never actually marketed with Intellivision/ECS boxes and logos. The system would use the same cassette and printer units which were being sold for the Mattel Aquarius home computer, but this fact seems to have not been widely advertised by Mattel.)\\n\\nInitially, at least a half-dozen ECS-supporting software titles were slated to roll out along with the ECS, with more to follow. Unfortunately, as noted above, by the time the ECS made its retail debut in 1983 a new management team had taken over at Mattel Electronics which was no longer interested in selling or promoting hardware add-ons, which they viewed as money-losers that had tied up too much of the company's capital for too little return. (Perhaps not without some justification, given the history of the long-delayed, never-released Keyboard Component and the lower-than-expected sales of the Intellivoice module.) The Marketing and Applications departments were also not particularly enthusiastic about the ECS unit, since it really didn't add any revolutionary features to the system and it was a struggle to come up with game ideas that would justify requiring the user to have one. \\n\\nAs a result, the ECS was not well-promoted, and few of the planned software titles were released before Richard Chang's \"Design & Development\" group was closed down in August 1983, effectively halting further work on ECS-supporting titles. A very few titles that were already well in progress were eventually completed, but none of them made it to production before Mattel Electronics ceased operations in January 1984.\\n\\n(Melody Blaster was the only title ever released for the Music Synthesizer add-on unit.)\\n\\n(Super NASL Soccer was eventually released as World Cup Soccer by Mattel Electronics' French division, which reformed under the name Nice Ideas when Mattel Electronics was shut down. World Cup Soccer lacked the 4-player capability and would run on a stock Intellivision console without the ECS module.)\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Entertainment Software Rating Board", "body": "The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is a self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings, enforces industry-adopted advertising guidelines, and ensures responsible online privacy principles for computer and video games and other entertainment software in Canada and the United States.\\n\\nThe ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (formerly Interactive Digital Software Association). By late 2009, it had assigned nearly 19,130 ratings to titles submitted by more than 350 publishers.\\n\\nOne of the reasons the ESRB was founded was due to violent content found in video games such as Night Trap, Mortal Kombat, Lethal Enforcers, and ''Doom'', as well as other controversial video games portraying overly violent or intense sexual situations at the time.\\n\\nThe ESRB assigns ratings to games based on their content, similar to the motion picture rating system used in many countries. Their aim is to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability. A game's rating is displayed on its box, the media, in advertisements and on the game's website(s).\\n\\nThe rating system is strictly voluntary, however nearly all video games are submitted for rating because many retail stores prohibit the sale of unrated video games and the major console manufacturer will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings.\\n\\nthumbThe symbols ESRB uses are stylized alphabetical letters meant to indicate the game's suitability. ESRB currently uses 7 different ratings.\\n\\nTo obtain a rating for a game, a publisher sends the ESRB videotaped footage of the most graphic and extreme content found in the game. The publisher also fills out a questionnaire describing the game's content and pays a fee based on the game's development cost:\\n\\nOn its website, the ESRB states that three trained raters, working independently, watch the footage and recommend a rating. If all raters agree on the rating, content descriptors are added and the ESRB notifies the publisher of its decision. If there is no consensus, additional raters review the footage and materials, or the majority opinion rules. After the rating is agreed upon, the ESRB in-house personnel review the footage and all materials to ensure that all information is accurate and a certificate is sent to the publisher. However, that decision is not final. If the publisher wishes, they may edit the game and resubmit the footage and questionnaire in order to achieve a lower rating, or appeal the information to a committee made up of entertainment software industry representatives. If this is the case, the process begins anew.\\n\\nWhen the game is ready for release, the publisher sends copies of the final version of the game to the ESRB. The game packaging is reviewed, and the ESRB says that its in-house personnel randomly play games to ensure that all the information provided during the rating process was complete and accurate. Penalties may apply to the publisher if it is eventually found, either through the in-house personnel's playing or consumer comments that the game's content is more extreme than the publisher stated in its application.\\n\\nThe identities of the ESRB raters are kept confidential and selected randomly from a pool of full-time ESRB employees who live in the New York City area. According to an ESRB introductory brochure from 1994: \"The raters represent a wide range of backgrounds, races, and ages and have no ties to the interactive entertainment industry. Raters include retired school principals, parents, professionals, and other individuals from all walks of life.\" Raters are supposed to review games as if they were the customer and receiving their first glance at the game. They are then required to take testing before becoming ESRB raters.\\n\\nAs video-gaming progressed into the 16-bit era, graphics and sound capabilities were dramatically increased. Blood and gore were much clearer and vibrant than in 8-bit games. For example blood in an 8-bit game may look blocky and pixelated while in 16-bit it can be a fluid graphic that can easily be identified. After the release of games such as Mortal Kombat, Doom, Night Trap and Lethal Enforcers, there was much controversy over video game content. Hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society, headed by Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl were held in late 1992 to 1993. The result of the hearings was that the entertainment software industry was given one year to form a working rating system or the federal government would intervene and create its own system. Around this time, the Videogame Rating Council (VRC) was formed by Sega of America to rate mostly its own games. In 1993, the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) was formed. Also in 1993, the 3DO Company formed their own rating system for games released on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer called the 3DO Rating System. In 1994, the Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC) was formed by the Software Publishers Association. However, because of some criticisms of both the VRC and the 3DO Rating System, they were phased out in 1994, and the RSAC in 1999. On July 29, 1994 the proposal from the IDSA for a rating system, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was presented in Congress and approved. In September 1994, the ESRB was established and became the de facto rater of video games in the United States. At this time, many companies who produced computer games such as LucasArts, Sierra On-Line and 3D Realms continued to follow the RSAC system as they were members of the SPA. Eventually, all companies, including 3DO, agreed to follow the ESRB ratings.\\n\\nInitially, there were five different ratings: Early Childhood, Kids to Adults, Teen, Mature and Adults Only. Shortly thereafter, the Informational and Edutainment descriptors were added. In 1996, the rating icons were altered so that it would be more clear who rated the product (this can be seen in the image of the Mature icon above). On January 1, 1998, the Kids to Adults rating was replaced with Everyone. Also in 1998, the Entertainment Software Rating Board Interactive (ESRBi) was formed which rated websites and online games. In late 1999, in order to make the rating symbols more legible, the pixelated rating icons were replaced with black and white icons. Beginning in early 2001, and continuing for the next couple of years, several of the content descriptors were retired and replaced. Content descriptors with \"Animated\" or \"Realistic\" in them had those portions removed. Also, the \"Skills\" descriptors used for the Early Childhood rating were removed as well. A short time later, the Gaming descriptor was changed to Gambling, which itself was split into Real and Simulated Gambling in the following years.\\n\\nIn mid 2003, the ESRBi was closed down. On June 26, 2003, the content descriptors were made larger and more legible and newer, more thorough descriptors for violence (Cartoon, Fantasy, Intense) were added as well as a descriptor for Mature Humor. Also, the Mature and Adults Only icons had a 17+ and 18+ added to their title band in order to clearly signify the age appropriateness. On March 2, 2005, after conferring with academicians and child development experts; the Everyone 10+ rating was introduced. Originally, raters were hired on a part-time basis; as of April 2007, the ESRB employs raters full-time.\\n\\nESRB has often been accused of not rating games harshly enough for violence and other related themes. Games such as Harvester, Manhunt, Rise of the Triad and Soldier of Fortune have shown gruesome violence, yet received the M rating. Many critics have claimed that these games deserve the AO rating and were given the M for commercial reasons. Rise of the Triad in particular, received the highest violence descriptor: \"Wanton and gratuitous violence\" from the RSAC, which was mitigated by being rated M by the ESRB. However, in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario, their respective provincial governments classified Soldier of Fortune and Manhunt as motion pictures, and gave them \"Restricted\" ratings, restricting their sale to adults only. The ESRB has only given out the AO rating solely for violence two times: once for Thrill Kill (which was cancelled after the developer was bought by Electronic Arts) and the second time for Manhunt 2. The Punisher, was not actually officially given the rating though was threatened with it and thus toned down the violence because of it. Manhunt 2 was edited before release in order to qualify for the M category, though a uncut PC version has since been released with an AO rating. Thrill Kill, received an AO rating with content descriptors for Animated Violence and Animated Blood and Gore. It was never released after the original publisher, Virgin Entertainment, was purchased by Electronic Arts who was more concerned about the adult content. The violence in Thrill Kill was a concern to the ESRB as it was sexualized, with sadomasochistic activities.\\n\\nCritics have claimed that the ESRB will only rate games AO if they have sexual content in them, no matter how much violence is present. Twenty-three products have been given and kept the AO rating. One was given it for unsimulated online gambling. Two were given for violence (see above). The rest were given it for sexual content and/or nudity. One game, Mass Effect featured two mild sexual scenes and was passed as an M, leading to controversy on Fox News Channel. Another, God of War, came with many different sex scenes, some of them interactive, and, unlike Mass Effect, it was not subject to controversies or protests (although they take place off screen). One of the games with \"Strong Sexual Content\" as a content descriptor also had \"Realistic Blood & Gore\", Riana Rouge, and another one had \"Violence\", Critical Point. Critical Point is an eroge, and Riana Rouge has Playboy Playmate in softcore sex scenes which leads some critics to believe that these games were rated AO because of sex, not violence. This criticism is shared with the movie rating systems. Lula 3D contains descriptors for \"Blood\", \"Strong Language\" and \"Violence\" in addition to sexually explicit material. Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Director's Cut also received the AO rating. While the game contains content identical to the original North American version titled Indigo Prophecy (\"Blood\", \"Strong Language\", \"Use of Drugs and Alcohol\" and \"Violence\"), the only content which was added in the director's cut version was sex scenes with nudity, one of which was interactive. Much like Fahrenheit, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas originally received an M rating but was changed to an AO rating because interactive sex scenes could be accessed in the game. Some critics believed that the ESRB in-house personnel may have overreacted to the attention the game received from the federal government and that the mini-game (which contained no nudity) was not explicit enough to have been re-rated. It should be noted that many adult oriented products, including erotica, have actually received M ratings. For example, The Guy Game and the Leisure Suit Larry series. However, these products are not carried by many major retailers (and many are usually grouped with adult products anyway) because of the sexual content.\\n\\nIn 2005, members of the mod community discovered that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for Windows could be modified to unlock an incomplete sex mini-game known as \"Hot Coffee\", which Rockstar North had decided to leave out of the final game. California State Assemblyman Leland Yee used the situation to rebuke both Rockstar and the ESRB and argued that the ESRB was not doing its job properly. U.S. Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Joe Lieberman also expressed their disapproval. Rockstar initially claimed that the mini-game was created by the mod community and was not a part of the original game. However, their stance changed when it was discovered that a third-party cheat device could be used to unlock the \"Hot Coffee\" scenes in console versions of the game. Shortly after, Rockstar conceded that the sex mini-game was in all released versions of the game, albeit inaccessible without third-party modification. The ESRB responded to the controversy by re-evaluating the game and changing its rating from M to AO, setting a precedent that games can be re-rated based on external factors such as third-party cheat devices. Although this made Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas the best selling game to receive an AO rating, Rockstar soon released a patch that disabled the modification on PC versions and re-released the game as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Second Edition. The new release disabled all access to the \"Hot Coffee\" mini-game and was given the game's original M rating by the ESRB as a result.\\n\\nIn 2006, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion had its rating changed from T to M due to \"more detailed depictions of blood and gore than were considered in the original rating, as well as a mod that, if accessed through a third-party modification to the PC version of the game, allows the user to play with topless versions of female characters.\" The game's publisher decided not to remaster or re-release the game to remove the hidden texture, stating that it believed the original rating was the most accurate assessment of what parents should expect from the game, since the texture was intended to be inaccessible to players. However, this texture was actually only used to provide a non-clipping texture for some armor types.\\n\\nRockstar Games' Manhunt 2 was postponed for three months in the United States as well as several other countries and continents due to uncensored relentless violence and gore. The game was given an initial AO rating by the ESRB and received a revised M rating after numerous edits. It was released on October 31, 2007. Less than a week after the release, it was discovered that it was possible to modify the PS2 and PSP versions of the game to erase the patches that censored the violent content. Rockstar Games has since claimed that even with the unauthorized patches that remove some of the screen blurring that many of the scenes were toned down from the original version submitted to the ESRB for rating. Following that, the ESRB chose not to change the game's rating after the drawn-out process of giving it the M rating. Ultimately, a completely uncut and uncensored beta for the PS2 and PSP versions were found by cracking into Manhunt 2, and an AO-rated PC version was released by Rockstar as a download exclusive on November 6, 2009 to the download site, Direct2Drive.com, as virtually all North American retailers refuse to stock AO-rated games.\\n\\nSimilarly, The Punisher was hacked into to allow uncensored kills, and the PC version had patches to remove the filters and intensify the violence.\\n\\nThe ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete. This can cause the existence of a title to become public information before the game is officially announced. As a result, the ESRB has implemented a process by which publishers with concerns about this practice can request that information about the game not be posted to the ESRB's website until a specific date.\\n\\nOn March 16, 2006, the ESRB gained, in an agreement with the video game software industry, the ability to restrict video game advertising \"to consumers for whom the product is not rated as appropriate.\" As a result, online retailers like Steam, Xbox Live Marketplace, PlayStation Network, and the Wii Shop Channel ban minors from downloading game demos or trailers for games rated Mature or Rating Pending.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Enzo Cucchi", "body": "thumb \\n\\nEnzo Cucchi (born 14 November 1949) is an Italian painter. \\n\\nA native of in Morro d'Alba, province of Ancona, he was a key member of the Italian Transavanguardia movement, along with fellow countrymen Francesco Clemente, Mimmo Paladino, Nicola De Maria, and Sandro Chia. The movement was at its peak during the 1980s and was part of a wider movement of Neo-Expressionists painters around the world.\\n\\nCucchi's first major Retrospective was held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York 1986 and his works are held in numerous museum collections including the Museum of Modern Art New York, the Tate London and the Art Institute of Chicago. Enzo Cucchi lives and works in Rome and Ancona.\\n\\nEnzo Cucchi was born in 1949 in Morro d‘Alba, a farming village in the province of Ancona in central Italy. As an autodidactic painter Cucchi was lauded in his early years even though he was more interested in poetry. He frequently visited poet Mino De Angelis, who was in charge of the magazine Tau. Through La Nuova Foglio di Macerata, a small publishing house, he met with art critic Achille Bonito Oliva, an important figure in the artist‘s prospective career. In its catalogues La Nuova Foglio di Macerata published writings of artists such as Cucchi's Il veleno è stato sollevato e trasportato! in 1976. Frequent trips to Rome in the mid-seventies revived Cucchi’s interest in visual arts. He moved to Rome, temporarily abandoned poetry and dedicated himself exclusively to the visual arts. Here Cucchi met with different artists such as Sandro Chia, Francesco Clemente, Mimmo Paladino and Nicola de Maria with whom he began to work in close contact and to establish dialectical and intellectual dialogues.\\n\\nAchille Bonito Oliva was the first to name this young generation of Italian artists of the seventies as a group: In Flash Art Magazine, no. 92-93, 1979, he used the term Transavanguardia for the first time. The official proclamation of the Transavanguardia took place at the Venice Biennial of 1980. The term was an idiom for the art of this young generation following the Avant-garde art of the sixties. These artists no longer sought to evoke discomfort in the spectator by all means and to force him to go beyond the work to grasp it fully. This new generation did not follow the restless quest for progress that did not allow any consideration of past traditions and for devising a language with which artists could state their attitude, opposing the current political system and society‘s deceasing values.\\n\\nThe members of the Transavanguardia-group may have nothing in common but their native country – as it seems – since each artist has his own working method: There are neither rules nor any binding language of expression. Nevertheless we can find fundamental bridging elements such as motifs gathered from imaginable reality and the free use of past and present with no preclusion but with references open to all directions without any constrictions and with no obligation to invent anything new. Every artist found his own way to create images/works as ciphers with an open symbolism, enigmas with any solution or with various solutions. Cucchi radicalises painting practice, taking the picture as an opportunity to accumulate and combine various elements, figurative and abstract, explicit and allusive. He develops his own specific kind of symbolism with suggestive forms which are mostly somehow linked with the landscape, the legends and the traditions of his home-region but also through a rapturous richness of colour. Hence some works may evoke old myths and legends, but Cucchi uses them only to express his feelings and imaginations. Cucchi obtains a suggestive strength from nature, history and culture, which he shows in a playful relationship with our technical world, using symbols like a train or an ocean-liner and employing colour in terms of idea, expansion and motion rather than for pictorial sensation. Cucchi allows his image total freedom of movement in all directions. Evoking astonishment and confusion, Cucchi does not aim to name, quote or prove anything, his pictorial language may be related only to his personal wishes, dreams and hopes while at the same time he experiences with the impetus of anonymity and of the impersonal. His artwork is often accompanied by poetic texts some of which have been published.\\n\\nFrom the beginning of the eighties on, Cucchi has been gaining international recognition as a representative of the new figurative expression. Aside from the numerous Transavanguardia- group-exhibitions, he had one-man-shows in galleries, museums and cultural sites all over the world.\\n\\nIn the late 1970s, Cucchi’s highly original work conspicuously stood out in a scene dominated by conceptual art. Art critic and dealer Mario Diacono supported him by exhibiting his work in Italy and the United States. Since 1979 Cucchi has maintained a co-operative relationship with gallery owner Emilio Mazzoli in Modena and with Bruno Bischofberger who represents the artist since 1981 and in world wide exclusivity since 1995. Between 1981 and 1985 also Gian Enzo Sperone frequently exhibited Cucchi‘s work in his galleries in Rome and New York. Consequently his experimental expressionist style gradually became influential whereas he set out to expand the material qualities in his art by painting or drawing directly on walls, using ceramics, mosaic or painted images as a part of sculpture and by creating free installation spaces.\\n\\nCucchi‘s varied interests have led him beyond the bounds of ordinary exhibitions. He has made outdoor sculptures for the Brueglinger Park in Basel in 1984, and the Louisiana Museum in Humblebaek, Denmark in 1985, a fountain for the garden of the Museo d’arte contemporanea Luigi Pecci in Prato in 1988 and the Fontana d‘Italia at York University in Toronto. Between 1992 and 1994 he collaborated with architect Mario Botta on the chapel built on Monte Tamaro near Lugano, Switzerland, where Cucchi assisted with designing the interior of the chapel, mainly the main altar and the executed murals for the apse and nave. Cucchi enjoys close relationships with poets and writers like Paolo Volponi, Goffredo Parise, Giovanni Testori, Ruggero Guarini, Alberto Boatto and Paul Evangelisti. He has made illustrations for their books while they have written on his art.Cucchi has also been active in the field of stage design: He has designed costumes and sets for productions such as Rossini‘s and Respighi‘s La Bottega Fantastica at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro and Heinrich von Kleist’s Penthesilea, both in 1986, Puccini‘s Tosca at the Teatro dell‘Opera in Rome, from 1990–1991, Pennisi‘s Funeral of the Moon in Gibellina, in 1991 and an adaptation of Erasmus‘ In Praise of Folly, in 1992. In 1996 he designed the curtain for the Teatro la Fenice in Senigallia.\\n\\nSelected Exhibitions:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis", "body": "Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, (also known as \"Bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma,\" \"Bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma,\" or \"bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma Brocq\") is a rare skin disease in the ichthyosis family affecting around 1 in 250,000 people.\\n\\nIt involves the clumping of keratin filaments.\\n\\nAt birth, affected babies are called \"enfant brûlé\", from the French for \"burned child\", because they look red and have a fragile top layer of skin which easily forms blisters and wounds. Such injury can be caused by diapers, or just by touching the baby. The wounds should be properly cared for, otherwise they are at risk from infection.\\n\\nThe skin is stressed by birth. It gets better after some weeks and fewer blisters are formed. Some months later the skin starts scaling; this is caused by hyperkeratosis. There is a fairly large variation in the degree and extent of the scaling and the blisters. \\n\\nIn particular, some patients have scaling and blisters on the palms and soles of the feet, whereas others do not. Usually scaling is seen on the rest of the body, often concentrated around the joints.\\n\\nAdditionally, the skin develops blisters (hence the bullous part of the name). Typically these will be more common in children than in adults. Depending on the form of the disease patients may also experience palmoplantar keratoderma and frequent superimposed infections.\\n\\nIt is possible to classify epidermolytic hyperkeratosis based upon palm and sole hyperkeratosis.\\n\\nThis is a dominant genetic condition caused by mutations in the genes encoding the proteins keratin 1 or keratin 10. \\n\\ngeneralized redness; thick, generally dark, scales that tend to form parallel rows of spines or ridges,especially near large joints; the skin is fragile and blisters easily following trauma; extent of blistering and amount of scale is variable\\n\\nOral retinoids have proven effective in treating this disease. Depending on the side effects they may improve the quality of life. Examples are etretinate, acitretin, isotretinoin\\n\\nGene Therapy is really the only true therapy on the horizon for sufferers of EHK.\\n\\nOver the past 10 years since the first EHK mouse model was developed, many ideas have been discussed about how best to cure EHK. Back as far as 1994 researchers were discussing new promising ideas such as topical lotions that would deliver ribozymes in a liposom cream. Ribozymes are a small piece of synthetic RNA which can digest RNA molecules. When cells make a protein from a gene on a chromosome sitting in the nucleus, the gene is first transcribed as a piece of RNA. This RNA is then translated into a protein. Ribozymes can be designed to destroy RNA molecules with specific sequences. In theory, this will stop the production of the protein encoded by the mutant alleles of the gene. This sounded like a promising theory however virtually no research funding has been applied to this idea over the past 10 years.\\n\\nLuckily other new ideas have moved to the foreground that are even more promising. Successful gene therapy solutions have been recently achieved on mouse models by Jiang Chen M.D., a post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dennis Roop, Ph.D., in the Center for Cutaneous Molecular Biology at Baylor College of Medicine's departments of molecular and cellular biology and dermatology in Houston.\\n\\nIn 1998 they developed an inducible mouse model for epidermolysis hyperkeratosis which is viable, due to the fact that the expression of a mutant K10 allele can be restricted to a focal area of the skin. \"Once the mutant K10 allele is activated in epidermal stem cells by topical application of an inducer, these stem cells continuously give rise to defective progeny that form hyperkeratotic lesions which persist for the life of the mouse. It was observed that partial suppression of the mutant K10 gene may be sufficient to eliminate the disorder.\"\\n\\nTo test this observation, Dr. Chen and his team of researchers developed siRNAs that target the mutant K10 gene products for degradation, without affecting normal K10 gene products. Dr. Chen observed that under these conditions, an efficient knock-down of mutant, but not normal, K10 genes could be achieved. The results allowed the normal K10 genes to function properly building healthy skin tissues. He claims that these results may prove to be a very vital step forward in forging a novel gene therapy and possible permanent corrective therapy for this debilitating skin disease.\\n\\nLarger animal models are the next step required to determine the safety and efficacy of novel in vivo therapies before testing in human subjects. A spontaneously occurring large animal model has been identified as the recessive dystrophic EB in golden retrievers where type-VII collagen is absent. This disease has successfully been corrected using retroviral vectors and ex vivo gene transfer. Norfolk Terriers have been identified as having epidermolytic hyperkeratosis naturally. Once these cases have been cured as the golden retrievers have been cured for EB, EHK will be ready for human clinical trials. If anyone is aware of this next critical step being worked on, please post details about it here.\\n\\nUntil gene therapy solutions finally become reality, EHK sufferers must treat their fragile skin carefully. Most have learned that taking regular extended baths allows patients to care for their fragile skin and keep it manageable. Baths that include sea salt seem to improve the process of softening and removing the thickened skin.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Epidicus", "body": "Epidicus is an ancient Roman play written by T. Macius Plautus. It is said to be one of Plautus's favorite works. Epidicus is the name of the main character, who is a slave. The plot takes many turns as Epidicus tries to please his master's son, Stratippocles. The main plot was based upon a Greek play, however the story line was changed in order to prevent a brother from marrying his half-sister. This change was made because Romans considered this incest and deeply disturbed them, Greeks, however, were not bothered by this.\\n\\nEpidicus was a slave who looked only to please those he served. In the play, Epidicus tricks his master, Periphanes, out of a sum of money in order to purchase a female slave, Acropolistis, that the master's son, Stratippocles, fell in \"love\" with. Epidicus does this by convincing Periphanes that this girl is his daughter from Philippa, whom he hasn't seen in many years, and has been captured in Thebes and brought to Athens. Believing this young woman is his daughter, Periphanes willingly hands over the money. Stratippocles soon goes off to war and falls in \"love\" with a different woman while away. To purchase this new woman, Stratippocles borrows forty mince from a banker. When Stratippocles returns home, he vows not to meet with his father until the debt is paid back to the banker. To accomplish this, Stratippocles tells Epidicus to accumulate the money, and if he cannot do so he will be severely punished. To convince Periphanes to give him more money, Epidicus tells his master that his son is about to purchase a singing - girl, Acropolistis, in order to marry her. Epidicus states that he needs to purchase her before his son can so that this can be avoided. Eventually, Periphanes decides to give his slave the money. Once the money is received, Epidicus uses it to pay off the banker. Epidicus then purchases a different singing - girl to act as if she were Acropolistis. A captain who is enamered with Acropolistis comes to Periphanes home in hopes of convincing Epidicus to allow him to gain custody of her. However, when the captain shows up he realizes that the singing - girl is not Acropolistis, but instead a fraud (all the while, the real Acropolistis is presented to Periphanes as his daughter, Telestis). While this is occurring, Philippa shows us at Periphanes home looking for her daughter since she heard she was brought to Athens. Periphanes assures Philippa that their daughter, Telestis, is safe inside. When Telestis is presented to Philippa, she instantly knows it is not her daughter and is a fraud (the real acropolistis). Epidicus is soon confronted about his double deceit and is to be severely punished. However, the woman that Stratippocles purchased while away is brought to Periphanes home with her former master, ready to be given to Stratippocles. When the young slave girl walks in, Philippa recognizes her to be her daughter, Telestis. Overwhelmed and confused, Periphanes finally meets his daughter for the first time. Stratippocles, upset about the loss of his \"love\" due to her being his half - sister, is \"comforted\" by Acropolistis (the original girl in which he had Epidicus purchase for him). Epidicus is quickly forgiven of his trickery and is set free because he helped reunite a father and daughter.\\n\\n"}

He seems to have been strong supporter of astrology, which, though derided by many Greek intellectuals, had been accepted and adopted by many Greeks from the seventh century BC through commercial contact with the Chaldea of Babylonia. \\n\\nIt is unclear when Epigenes lived - he may have lived about the time of Augustus; some conjecture that he lived centuries earlier - but he is known to have refined the study of his chosen field, defining Saturn, for example, as \"cold and windy.\" Along with Apollonius of Myndus and Artemidorus of Parium, he boasted of having been instructed by the Chaldean priest-astrologers, many of whom infiltrated Greece when the ports of Egypt opened to Greek ships after 640 BC.\\n\\nEpigenes' claims to have been educated by the Chaldeans comes from the writings of Seneca. Pliny the Elder writes that Epigenes attests to the fact that the Chaldeans preserved astral observations in inscriptions upon brick tiles (coctilibus laterculis) extending to a period of 720 years. Pliny calls Epigenes a writer of first-rate authority (gravis auctor imprimis). The 55-km lunar crater Epigenes is named after him.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Epigenetic principle", "body": "See also epigenesis.The epigenetic principle is an idea developed by Erik Erikson that states that every organism is born with a certain purpose, and continues to develop how it was intended to in interrelation with its environment. Biology unfolding in relation to a socio-cultural setting.This development is done in stages of psychosocial development, where \"progress through each stage is in part determined by our success, or lack of success, in all the previous stages\". Biology unfolding in relation to a socio-cultural setting.\\n\\nThe epigenetic view states that development is the result of an ongoing, bi-directional interchange between heredity and the environment. Environmental influences range from the things we lump together under nurture (such as parenting, family dynamics, schooling, and neighborhood quality) to biological encounters such as viruses and happenings in cells. It is hard to say how much a percentage of nature or nurture makes us who we are. Genes produce proteins throughout the lifespan, in many different environments. The epigenetic view supports the theory that genes are collaborative, not determining an individual’s traits in an independent manner, but rather in an interactive manner with the environment. Different cultures display varying environmental influences. Recognizing Hofstede's culture dimensions: Power/Distance, Uncertainty/Avoidance, Individualism/Collectivism, and Masculinity/Femininity, help contribute to noticeable cultural differences. The epigenetic principle relies on the environment (which varies among cultures)and heredity as influencing development. Therefore, depending upon where and how individuals grow up can forecast their potential development. Socioeconomic status aids environmental influences. Access to the right foods, medicines, and care facilitates positive development. \\n\\n"}

Until his resignation from the Cabinet in January 2006, he served as the Minister of Energy and Energy Industries in the then People's National Movement government a post he held from December, 2001. A geologist and geophysicist by training, Williams entered Parliament in 1995 when he won the Port of Spain South seat formerly held by PNM founder Dr. Eric E. Williams (no relative). \\n\\nIn a now discredited February 2004 letter to Prime Minister Patrick Manning, PNM Councillor Dansam Dhansook alleged that he had paid a TT$75,000 (approx. US$ 12,000) bribe to Williams in seven separate payments over the period January to July, 2003. The letter was made public on April 27, 2005 when it was read in the House of Representatives by Kamla Persad-Bissessar, United National Congress MP for Siparia. \\n\\nOn January 7, 2006 seven warrants for Williams arrest were issued on a charge of misconduct in public office for corruptly receiving $75,000 in 2003. Williams has maintained his innocence, but \"senior government members\" predicted correctly that he would resign his ministerial portfolio on January 9, 2006. On January 9 the seven charges were laid indictably against Williams. He was granted bail of TT$600,000.\\n\\nAlthough no PNM officials appeared at his hearing, other than then Mayor of San Fernando Ian Atherly and Councillor Cynthia Pipier of the Port-of-Spain City Corporation , three Cabinet Minister, Fitzgerald Hinds, Dr. Keith Rowley (who was being investigated by the Integrity Commission but has since been exhonerated) and Diane Seukeran spoke to the press in his defense.\\n\\nOn December 31, 2007, all charges against Mr. Williams were dismissed. His accuser Dansam Dhansook was declared to be 'manifestly unreliable' by Senior Magistrate L. Cardinez-Ragoonanan who presided over the Preliminary Inquiry into the charges.. see, http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,70644.html \\n\\n...... Earlier, sitting in the Fourth Court, Magistrate Cardenas-Ragoonanan cited several inconsistencies in the prosecution’s case, the most crucial being that the evidence of its main witness was “unreliable and inconsistent.” \\n\\nDuring his testimony, Dhansook, a PNM Councillor and contractor with Terra Seis Siesmic Surveys Limited, told the Court that he was at Balisier House when Williams demanded payments from him. \\n\\nHowever, a few moments later, Dhansook said he was at a Christmas party he held for his staff and that he clearly remembered because it was two days before his birthday. Yesterday, Cardenas-Ragoonanan said, “The fact that Mr Dhansook testified he was in two places at the same time when the plan was hatched, sent red flags of uncertainty. It was impossible that he could be at Balisier House and at a staff party in Rio Claro, if by virtue of geography alone.” \\n\\nThe Magistrate added, “I find the evidence tenuous...tenuous indeed, vague, uncertain and definitely not enough for any jury to convict on.” \\n\\nCardenas-Ragoonanan also ruled that there were several flaws in the allegation itself as there was no documentary evidence to support whether payments were made to Williams. “Mr Dhansook was unable to give specific times and occasions when the payments were allegedly made to Mr Williams, his evidence was tenuous, at worst unbelievable, a jury should not have to speculate. Therefore I find it that no prima facie case can be made out against Mr Williams on Dhansook’s evidence,” the magistrate said.''''''\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eric Gascoigne Robinson", "body": "Rear Admiral Eric Gascoigne Robinson VC, OBE (16 May 1882 – 20 August 1965) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He earned his award with a string of daring operations whilst a Lieutenant Commander with the fleet stationed off the Dardanelles during the Gallipoli campaign in World War I, including the single-handed destruction of a Turkish naval gun battery and the destruction of a captured British submarine under fire from Turkish shore artillery.\\n\\nFollowing these exploits he was badly wounded at the frontline on the Gallipoli Peninsula, but recovered and served continuously for the remainder of the war and into the Russian Civil War. In 1939 aged 57, he again volunteered for military service and spent three more years at war, commanding convoys during the Second battle of the Atlantic. During his lengthy career, Robinson remained a highly-regarded officer who served through four wars and amassed a large collection of awards and honours.\\n\\nEric Gascoigne Robinson was born in 1882 at Greenwich in South-East London to John Lovell Robinson and Louisa Aveline Gascoigne. John was the chaplain of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich and Eric's youth was spent in preparation for a life at sea. Robinson joined HMS ''Victory'' aged just fifteen in 1897 and rapidly progressed to the battleship HMS ''Majestic'' and then the light cruiser HMS ''Endymion'', in which he took part in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in China. It was here, aged 18, that he saw his first action with the relief force, being wounded in action, mentioned in despatches and gaining a reputation as a daring and resourceful officer. He remained in China serving on a Yangtze gunboat for several years before returning to England and becoming a torpedo specialist at HMS ''Vernon'' in 1907.\\n\\nIn 1910, Robinson was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and spent his time between the torpedo school HMS Vernon, the depot ship HMS ''Thames'', the battleship HMS ''Blenheim'' and the cruiser HMS ''Amethyst'' on active service. In 1913, he married Edith Gladys Cordeux, with whom he had three children. Robinson was slightly injured in a train accident shortly after his wedding, but soon recovered and was dispatched to the Mediterranean Sea at the outbreak of the First World War on board the old battleship HMS ''Vengeance''.\\n\\nrightThe first exploit in his Victoria Cross nomination was the result of his close friendship and working relationship with another aggressive officer, Roger Keyes, whom he had first met in China fifteen years before. Keyes was asked by his superior, Admiral John de Robeck, to prepare an assault on the Turkish gun battery at Orkanieh (also known as Achilles' Tomb), a position between Kum Kale and Yeni Shehr on the southern shore of the Dardanelles. This position had withstood fire from the battleships of the Allied fleet during the preceding weeks. Robinson was suggested as the leader of a commando force of sailors and Royal Marines who were tasked with destroying the battery and withdrawing in good order on 26 February. \\n\\nthumbRobinson accepted the mission without hesitation and his force landed without being noticed in the early morning, destroyed two small artillery pieces and made fast progress towards the main battery, before being pinned down by Turkish snipers in the mid-afternoon. The white naval uniforms of the sailors proved an easy target for the Turks and casualties mounted as Turkish reinforcements were brought up to cut the raiding party off. Instead of withdrawing in the face of this threat, Robinson marched his men through gullies and came out close to a small rise behind the main battery. The open ground of the rise was covered by several Turkish snipers, but realising the importance of removing the artillery overlooking the sea passage, Robinson delegated command of the party to a junior officer and made the climb alone, dodging bullets in his white uniform until he crested the rise unhurt, emerging a few minutes later and starting back apparently unconcerned by the increasingly heavy gunfire directed at him. He was said to be \"strolling around . . . under heavy rifle fire . . . like a sparrow enjoying a bath from a garden hose\". The battery had been ungarrisoned, and Robinson was able to lay fuses which destroyed the large 9.4\" main gun and two anti-aircraft emplacements within the position. Withdrawing in good order, Robinson evaded the Turkish reinforcements and then directed gunfire from the fleet onto their positions, including a force garrisoning an ancient tomb, inflicting heavy casualties. An immediate recommendation for the Victoria Cross was put forward by Admiral de Robeck who had observed proceedings from HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'' offshore.\\n\\nthumbDuring March, in preparation for the landings on the peninsula, Robinson led four sorties into the extensive sea mine around the beaches and bays of Gallipoli. On one of these, his minesweeper was struck by small calibre shells 84 times and the other operations were scarcely less dangerous but, in spite of Turkish resistance, Robinson was able to clear wide lanes for the invasion forces.Robinson volunteered in April for an even more dangerous mission, following the Turkish capture of the grounded submarine HMS ''E15''. All efforts to destroy this craft had so far failed and it was considered vital for naval morale that the submarine not be allowed to remain in Turkish hands. Robinson took command of two picket boats from the battleships HMS ''Triumph'' and HMS ''Majestic'', each armed with two torpedoes mounted on the gunwales in dropping gear, and entered the Dardanelles under cover of darkness on 18 April. Caught in a blaze of searchlights, and under heavy fire from the Turkish artillery and machine guns, both boats miraculously arrived unscathed. A carelessly-directed Turkish searchlight briefly illuminated E15. The boat from HMS Majestic under the command of Lt. Goodwin seized the opportunity and attacked. The first torpedo missed, and seconds later the boat was struck by a shell that blew away much of her stern, mortally wounding one of her crew and causing her to sink. Undeterred, Goodwin went in again and scored a direct hit with his second torpedo, just forward of the conning tower, wrecking the grounded submarine. thumb\\n\\nObserving his consort's plight, Robinson did not hesitate, steaming to the stricken vessel and rescuing her crew before escaping downstream to Mudros. It was estimated that the Turks fired at least 500 heavy calibre rounds of ammunition at the two boats in just a few minutes. A German officer present noted that \"I have never on the course of the war seen an attack carried out with such pluck and fearlessness\". It has also been commented that this action should have brought Robinson a second Victoria Cross, but in the end it was merely added to his previous citation and practically ensured its confirmation. As a reward for this operation, he was promoted to Commander by special decree.\\n\\nIn August, Robinson was sent to Anzac Cove as a naval liaison officer and on his second day there, was badly wounded near the front line, forcing his evacuation to England, where King George V presented him with his medal at Buckingham Palace. Returned to the Mediterranean in December 1915 following his recuperation, he took over the coastal monitor HMS ''M21'', in which he shelled Turkish positions throughout Egypt and Palestine and was awarded another mention in dispatches and the Egyptian Order of the Nile, 4th Class. Returning to England in the summer of 1917, he narrowly missed selection for Keyes's operations against Zeebrugge and Ostend owing to his war wounds, and instead trained crews of coastal torpedo boats, a role which led to a distant posting in the Caspian Sea during the Russian Civil War, fighting the Bolshevik forces along the Russian coastline. Robinson commanded a squadron of coastal torpedo boats in the Caspian and forced the surrender of several enemy forts through aggressive tactics. These achievements would later win him the Imperial Russian Order of St. Anne, 2nd Class. His most notable achievement at this time was leading a small coastal motor boat inside the harbour of Fort Alexandrovsk, where he sank a barge and prompted a mass surrender from the garrison.\\n\\nthumbthumb this period of extended service, Robinson was brought home, appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire by the King for his Caspian Sea service, promoted again to Captain and posted to HMS ''Iron Duke''. Robinson then served in a number of training establishments and dockyards, as well as a brief stint with the Far East Fleet, during which he received the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class for his services. In 1925, he was inducted into the Freemasons and remained a prominent member of the Navy Lodge for the rest of his life. The organisation still commemorates him in their publications. He retired at age 51 in 1933 as a rear-admiral, but when the Second World War broke out, Robinson immediately offered his services and for three years, commanded convoys across the Atlantic Ocean. For this service, he was later presented with the Norwegian King Haakon VII's Freedom Cross. Eventually a bout of ill-health caused by a combination of the strain of long service, his age, and the death of his son, Midshipman Edward Cordeaux Robinson, in the sinking of the cruiser HMS ''Neptune'' in December 1941, prompted a second retirement in 1942.\\n\\nRobinson settled in the village of Langrish, near Petersfield in east Hampshire. He died peacefully at Haslar Naval Hospital, Gosport, on 20 August 1965 and was laid to rest at St John's, the village church he had served for 20 years as warden. For unknown reasons, his grave was without a headstone until 1998, although a large plaque to him was dedicated by his sister in 1969 and surmounts the altar. Following investigations by the Naval VC Association, his grave was discovered and a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone erected. At the dedication ceremony, attended by over 150 friends, relatives, Masons and servicemen, Admiral Derek Reffell gave the eulogy which stated: \"The admiral was a hero, but more importantly he was a naval man from the finest mould. Now at last we can accord him the dignity he deserves.\"\\n\\n"}

Veríssimo worked in a pharmacy before obtaining a job at Editora Globo, a book publisher, where he translated and released works of writers like Aldous Huxley. During the Second World War, he went to the United States. This period of his life was recorded in some of his books, including: Gato Preto em Campo de Neve (\"Black Cat in a Snow Field\"), A Volta do Gato Preto (\"The Return of the Black Cat\"), and História da Literatura Brasileira (\"History of Brazilian Literature\"), which contains some of his lectures at UCLA.

{"title": "Erna Sack", "body": "rightErna Sack (born 6 February 1898, Spandau, Berlin — died 2 March 1972, Mainz), was a German coloratura soprano of exceptional talent.\\n\\nErna Sack's maiden name was Weber, and as a child her voice attracted attention both at school and in the church choir in which she sang. In 1921, Erna married Hermann Sack. She studied at the Prague Conservatory, and later in Berlin with Oscar Daniel. \\n\\nShe received her first break aged 30, when the wife of conductor Bruno Walter happened to hear her at one of her lessons and persuaded her husband, who was then the musical director at the Berlin State Opera, to audition her. Subsequently she joined them and between 1928 and 1930 she sang many small roles with this famous company, including parts in the 1929 local premiéres of Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's Sly, on 11 May, Eugen d'Albert's Die Schwarze Orchidee on 9 June, and Mark Lothar's Tyll on 1 September. At the same time she recorded several small roles in operas for Berlin Radio. But Walter advised her to gain more experience in provincial opera houses and to enlarge her repertory.\\n\\nHer career really started in high gear in 1930 when her uncanny ability to sing those stratospheric high notes, including c7 (C above high C. (Richard Strauss later wrote a new cadenza for her high voice, for her to sing as Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos).\\n\\nIn 1931 she sang Norina in Gaetano Donizetti's Don Pasquale at Bielefeld, where her voice made a great impression and her gifts immediately recognised. The Wiesbaden Theatre engaged her in 1932, and in that year she also made several radio broadcasts and recordings. In 1934 she was engaged by the Breslau Theatre, where he roles included her first Zerbinetta in Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos, and the following year arrived at the Dresden State Opera, where she attracted the attention of Karl Böhm and, above all, Richard Strauss. In 1934 she also made a spectacular return to Berlin, appearing as Gilda in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto alongside Heinrich Schlusnus as the Jester and Walther Ludwig as the Duke. The conductor was Erich Kleiber.\\n\\nIn 1935, Erna Sack made her first series of concert tours, to Austria, the Netherlands, the French Third Republic and the United Kingdom. During the same year, she signed her famous exclusive recording contract with Telefunken. She appeared in the world premier of Strauss's Die Schweigsame Frau, a role in which her special commitment earned her the gratitude of both Strauss and Karl Böhm. As a result she was invited to sing the part of Zerbinetta under Strauss' personal direction when the Dresden State Opera visited the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, in 1936.\\n\\nFrom this point onwards Sack's career took off. She seemed to work tirelessly, at the opera, in concert tours, and touring, including to Rome where she appeared in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Magic Flute with a cast that included Tito Schipa and Licia Albanese, Copenhagen, Oslo, and, for the first time, the United States, where she shared a platform at Carnegie Hall with Joseph Schmidt and Richard Tauber (24 October 1937) singing a duet from Franz Lehár's the Merry Widow. She had some difficulty, however, when asked to sing at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, being asked to sing the roles of Rosina and Donizetti's Lucia in the Italian language, because she argued that she had not had sufficient time to re-learn those roles in their original language (throughout Europe at that time operas were largely sung in the tongue of the nation in which they were being performed). \\n\\nAfter World War II, Erna Sack toured extensively and was particularly successful in Latin America, especially Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, (with the result that she and her husband took Brazilian citizenship). But it was in Canada that she enjoyed her greatest post-war successes and for a number of years the couple lived in Montreal. She later toured South Africa, and even South-West Africa, and returned to West Germany in 1950.\\n\\nIn 1953, she carried out an extended tour of the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin, a marathon undertaking involving over 40 concerts that was followed that autumn by a major tour of Australia and New Zealand. In the autumn of 1954 she celebrated her return to the United States which included a triumphant appearance at Carnegie Hall. She ended her concert career with one final tour of West Germany in the autumn of 1954 and a brief tour of East Germany in 1957, and then withdrew from public life.\\n\\nErna Sack also appeared in numerous films produced in Germany such as Blumen von Nizza (1935) and Nanon, the latter being one of the most famous operettas produced in this period. Throughout her career Erna Sack recorded profusely, first on acetate, then, starting about 1935, on the new German invention - BASF magnetic tape. Recording on tape proved to be infinitely superior to disc and very considerable quantities of those recordings were later transferred from 78s to Long Playing records (LPs). Today several companies are producing fully remastered Compact Discs (CDs) of Erna Sack, including, of course, Telefunken, and the French company LYS. ARCHIPEL has also produced recordings of the Carnegie Hall performances (the Americans, however, still recording on acetate).\\n\\nShe died in a Mainz clinic on 2 March 1972 following an operation for cancer.\\n\\n"}

His father, Charles Drury, continued the family farm and was a forward-looking farmer who utilized new techniques and technologies. In 1882, he was president of the Agricultural and Arts Association of Ontario. He also served reeve of Oro Township in Simcoe County for 13 years and was elected to the Ontario legislature as an Ontario Liberal Party member where he served from 1882 to 1890, the last two years as the province's first Minister of Agriculture.\\n\\nDrury was an \"Opposition\" candidate in Simcoe North in the 1917 wartime election held as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. He was defeated by the Government candidate.\\n\\nE. C. Drury was a co-founder of the UFO in 1913, but did not run in the 1919 election that returned farmer candidates as the largest bloc in the provincial legislature. Not having a leader, the UFO Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) asked Drury to lead them. The UFOs 49 MLAs joined with 11 Labour members to form a coalition government. It was the first of a wave of United Farmers governments that took power in several provinces and that founded the Progressive Party of Canada.\\n\\nDrury's progressive government created the first Department of Welfare for the province and brought in allowances for widows and children, a minimum wage for women and standarized adoption procedures. His government also expanded Ontario Hydro, created the Province of Ontario Savings Office - a provincially owned bank that was designed to lend money to farmers at a lower rate - began the first major reforestation program in North America, and initiated construction of the modern highway system. Drury also arranged for a grant for unknown researchers Frederick Banting and Charles Best who would go on to discover insulin.\\n\\nThe government was also a strict enforcer of temperance measures, amidst mixed publicity; in 1920 an Provincial Temperance enforcer, The Reverend J O L Spracklin, shot and killed an illicit liquor trader.\\n\\nThe government under Drury tried to be a \"people's government\" rather than a \"class government\", but in so doing, alienated the base of its support, particularly farmers. The UFO government clashed with the UFO organization (led by James J. Morrison throughout Drury's term) which ultimately withdrew its support from the government.\\n\\nDrury also alienated industrialists and many workers by battling with Sir Adam Beck and his plans for expansion of the province's hydro-electric system. Many labour leaders distrusted a government dominated by farmers, feeling that they could not understand the problems of urban workers. Drury's failure to establish fair wage provisions in government contracts and his commitment to free trade that threatened the livelihood of industrial workers alienated urban workers further.\\n\\nThe government was also much harmed by the Ontario Bond Scandal that resulted in provincial treasurer Peter Smith being jailed.\\n\\nThe government was opposed by all the major newspapers in the province, with the exception of the Toronto Star, and, despite its attempt to broaden its base, was opposed by business.\\n\\nThe Drury government collapsed after it introduced a bill in the legislature that would have brought in proportional representation and a preferential ballot and Drury called an early election. The government was defeated when it ran for re-election in the 1923 provincial election, in part, due to false claims that Drury had used $100 to purchase a new coal scuttle for his personal use. In fact, the device was an old scuttle which had been retrieved from storage and polished up. Drury never responded to the false claim, however, and it contributed to opposition claims of the government's extravagance.\\n\\nDrury retired from politics, but ran later as a federal candidate. Unlike many UFOers, he never joined either the Liberal Party of Canada or the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.\\n\\nDrury was active with the Progressive Party of Canada following the demise of his provincial government. He ran as a Progressive candidate in Simcoe North in the Canadian federal election, 1925, 1926 and 1930 federal elections but was defeated by Conservative candidates by margins of 600, 200 and 800 votes respectively.\\n\\nIn 1934, he was appointed sheriff and registrar of Simcoe County, a position he held until 1959, and wrote for magazines such as Maclean's. Drury also wrote two local histories, The story of Simcoe County (1955) and All for a beaver hat: a history of early Simcoe County (1959).\\n\\nIn 1966, — over 40 years after his Premiership had ended — he published his memoirs, Farmer Premier: Memoirs of the Honourable E. C. Drury.\\n\\nDrury remained interested in political matters. During the debate on whethar or not Canada should install American-operated nuclear-tipped Bomarc missiles in the 1960s, Drury wrote \"the next government of Canada... should refuse to accept nuclear arms. The whole nuclear program of the United States is dangerous.\"\\n\\nThere is a secondary school, E.C. Drury High School and also the provincial E. C. Drury School for the Deaf, both in Milton, Ontario.\\n\\n"}

Istook lost the gubernatorial race by a very wide margin, getting only 33.5% of the vote to Henry's 66.5%.\\n\\nIstook's grandparents immigrated to the U.S. from Hungary through Ellis Island and spoke Hungarian at home. He graduated from Castleberry High School in Fort Worth, Texas in 1967 and received a bachelor of arts degree from Baylor University (in Waco, Texas) in 1971. He eventually moved to Warr Acres, a suburb of Oklahoma City. \\n\\nHe worked full time as a radio news reporter first at KOMA (now KOKC) and then at WKY in Oklahoma City while attending law school, receiving a law degree from Oklahoma City University School of Law in 1976. After graduation, he established his own law firm, and practiced law for 15 years.\\n\\nIstook also was director of the Oklahoma State Alcoholic and Beverage Control Board (1977–1978), was legal counsel to popular Oklahoma Governor David L. Boren (1978), and was a member of the board of the Oklahoma County metropolitan library system (1982–1986), chairman of the Warr Acres city council (1982–1986), director of the Warr Acres Chamber of Commerce, and an Oklahoma state representative 1987–1993.\\n\\nIn the 1992 Republican primary, Istook challenged and defeated incumbent Deputy House Minority Whip Mickey Edwards in a three-way primary that also featured former federal prosecutor Bill Price. Both Istook and Price used Edwards' involvement in the House banking scandal to chip away at his support.\\n\\nIstook narrowly defeated his Democratic challenger, Laurie Edwards, in November, winning by only six points. He never faced another contest nearly that close, and was reelected six more times from what has long been considered the most Republican district in Oklahoma.\\n\\nAlthough Istook lives in Warr Acres, he was listed on the House roll as \"R-Oklahoma City.\"\\n\\nIstook is pro-life. He opposes abortion, and does not support federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. Istook supports the position that abortion should be prohibited except when the mother's life is in danger. Istook opposes gay marriage and the adoption of children into same-sex homes. He favors a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Istook favors a constitutional amendment to restrict burning the U.S. flag.\\n\\nIstook introduced the Religious Freedom Amendment, a Constitutional Amendment to permit school prayer, in 1995 and (slightly modified) in 1997. On June 4, 1998 the House voted 224-203, with 7 abstentions, in favor of it, but it failed as a Constitutional amendment, needing a 2/3 majority to pass. He reintroduced it in 1999, and again with different text in 2001, renamed the Religious Speech Amendment, and in 2003 . The other efforts did not make it out of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution.\\n\\nIstook opposes more federal funds for health coverage and supports the creation of personal accounts within Social Security. He supports the Bush Administration's tax cuts and want to make those permanent. He favors expansion of free trade; he voted in favor of CAFTA. He wants the U.S. to withdraw from the World Trade Organization, wants the end of the estate tax, and supported Normal Trade Relations with the People’s Republic of China to be made permanent.\\n\\nIstook voted to make the USA PATRIOT Act permanent and supports intelligence gathering by the military. Istook favors military recruiting on college campuses that receive federal aid. Istook stands behind the Bush Administration and its handling of the War in Iraq and supports higher Defense Department funding.\\n\\nIstook does not support a U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol nor heavy taxpayer subsidies for alternative fuel sources. He supports drilling in ANWR.\\n\\nIstook is against the current federal funding level for Amtrak. For several years, he chaired the subcommittee on Treasury, Transportation, and Special Agencies, which oversaw transportation funding. In 2004, Istook denied special transportation funding (earmarks) requests for districts of 21 Republican House members because the other Republicans had written a letter supporting of funding of $1.8 billion for Amtrak. Istook took the view that their request for major funding increases for Amtrak took precedence over their requests for their districts, and viewed those requests as trying to \"double-dip\" into the Treasury. Istook lost the chairmanship in 2005, in large part because others in the Republican party were still upset over his handling of this issue.\\n\\nIstook introduced language into an FY2004 federal spending bill that would cut funding for transit authorities that sponsored advertisements contradicting current government policies and laws regarding marijuana. Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia later ruled that the \"Istook Amendment\", as it came to be known, was unconstitutional on grounds that it violated the First Amendment, stating \"the government articulated no legitimate state interest in the suppression of this particular speech other than the fact that it disapproves of the message, an illegitimate and constitutionally impermissible reason.\"\\n\\nIstook received $29,000 in campaign contributions from Abramoff and some of his clients. Istook wrote letters urging the Bush administration to reject a casino proposal that Abramoff's clients opposed. On January 9, 2006, Istook announced he would give $23,000 in Abramoff-related money that was donated to his re-election campaign or his PAC to the Boy Scouts of America. This is in addition to $6,000 in Abramoff-related donations given to the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in December 2005. His congressional campaign paid back $5,126 to Abramoff's Sports Suites LLC, for the use in 2003 of skyboxes by the congressman for an American Idol concert and a Washington Redskins game. Istook has denied any connection between the donations and his activities, saying in 2006, \"I barely knew the man.\"\\n\\nIstook is identified in documents filed in June 2008 against his former chief of staff, John Albaugh, as \"Representative 4.\" According to the documents, Istook called Abramoff in 2003 to thank him in advance for use of one of Abramoff's FedEx Field skyboxes for a fundraising event. Istook asked Abramoff which projects his clients wanted in the upcoming transportation bill. The government filing refers to an Abramoff e-mail saying Istook \"had basically asked what we want in the transportation bill,\" and telling his colleagues at Greenberg Traurig to \"make sure we load up our entire Christmas list.\" Four of Kevin A. Ring's clients later received at least $1 million each in the transportation bill.\\n\\nOn June 2, 2008, Albaugh pleaded guilty to one count of corruption and conspiracy. According to plea documents, Albaugh received as part of the conspiracy more than $4,000 worth of sporting event tickets, concert tickets (including tickets to George Strait and Tim McGraw) and meals. Albaugh also admitted that, as part of this corrupt relationship, he secured from Kevin A. Ring, Abramoff, Greenberg Traurig, and their clients the use of suites at professional sporting events and facilities and catering at Signatures Restaurant, the costs of which were not timely reimbursed or disclosed as \"in kind\" campaign contributions in required filings with the Federal Election Commission.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIstook announced he would run for governor of Oklahoma against Democratic incumbent Brad Henry on October 3, 2005. He was immediately the consensus frontrunner for the nomination, as a seven-term incumbent U.S. Representative whose district covered most of the Oklahoma City area, the state's largest media market.\\n\\nIn the July 2006 primary, Istook got 55% of the vote to become the Republican nominee. Oil businessman Bob Sullivan was second with 31 percent of the vote.\\n\\nHenry and Istook faced each other in the November general election after a heated campaign. Henry defeated Istook, gathering 66.5% of the total vote — the biggest landslide in an Oklahoma governor's race in almost half a century. Istook carried three counties; Beaver, Cimarron and Texas, all counties in Oklahoma's far western panhandle.\\n\\nIstook's campaign was managed by campaign manager Chip Englander, a political operative from California. National media attention was attracted when it turned out that Jordan Edmund, one of the campaign's workers from California, had been one of the congressional pages who received unwelcome attention in the Mark Foley scandal.\\n\\nErnest Istook is a Distinguished Fellow at The Heritage Foundation and host of the conservative think tank's radio show. The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institute - a think tank - whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense. \\n\\nIn 2008, Istook was appointed to the National Advisory Board for the national children's charity Operation Kids. \\n\\nIstook and his wife Judy (whom he met through his radio job at KOKC and married in 1973) have five children, two sons and three daughters, and seven grandchildren. Istook, who comes from a Southern Baptist background, is now a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon Church).\\n\\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"|+ : Results 1992–2004!|Year!!|Democrat!|Votes!|Pct!!|Republican!|Votes!|Pct!!|3rd Party!|Party!|Votes!|Pct!|-|1992|| || align=\"right\" |107,579| |47%|| || align=\"right\" |123,237| |53%|||||||-|1994|| |(no candidate)| align=\"right\" || ||| |Ernest J.

{"title": "Ernesto Samper", "body": "Ernesto Samper Pizano (born 3 August 1950) is a Colombia politician. He served as the President of Colombia from August 7, 1994 to August 7, 1998, representing the Liberal Party. He was involved in the 8000 process scandal, which takes its name from the folio number assigned to it by the chief prosecutor's office. The prosecutor charged that money from the Cali Cartel was funneled into Samper's presidential campaign to gain his success in what would have been a very close race after he failed to win by a majority during the first round (Colombia has 2 rounds of elections, unless the first round yields a majority winner).\\n\\nIn 1993, when the presidential campaign was in its early stages, it became increasingly clear that the race was going to be close, particularly between Samper and Andrés Pastrana, the candidate of the Colombian Conservative Party: opinion polls were sharply divided. Presidential elections took place on May 29, 1994. The results of the first electoral round showed Ernesto Samper winning with a slight 0.32% lead over Andrés Pastrana. Colombian electoral law states that if no candidate wins more than 50% + 1 vote in the first round, a second round between the two candidates who achieved the highest number of votes in the first round shall take place to identify a winner.\\n\\nThe results of the first round threw the Samper campaign team into a frenzy to secure additional funding to widen the margin over the opposing candiate. They had assumed that Ernesto Samper would win the election easily in the first round and had spent all of their campaign funds to achieve this. With the campaign financials running in the red, the campaign managers were faced with the need to rally support for an additional three weeks against a strong, well-funded opponent. In what can be described as a desperate attemtpt to win at all cost, the campagin turned to the Cali cartel, receiving cash donations in excess of $6 million US dollars. These donations were delivered in large colourful paper bags normally used for birthday gifts.\\n\\nAfter three weeks of arduous campaigning, Ernesto Samper was elected president, once again by a narrow 2% margin.\\n\\nShortly after his presidential victory, Samper was accused by his opponent and future successor, Andrés Pastrana, of having received campaign donations from the Cali cartel in excess of $6 million US dollars. Samper initially denied the allegations and deemed his political adversary a sore loser. Soon afterwards a series of damaging tape recordings were released to the public, the \"narco-cassettes\". Years later, the DEA´s Joe Toft would claim ownership of the recordings as he was set to depart for Texas where he would retire soon after.The Chief Prosecutor at the time, Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento, personally led the investigation. Valdivieso was a cousin of the late Luis Carlos Galán, a charismatic Liberal party presidential candidate assassinated in 1989 by the Medellín Cartel for his political views, particularly for favoring the extradition of drug lords to the United States. Valdivieso discovered connections between the Cali drug cartel and top figures of Colombia's society, including politicians, journalists, athletes, army and police officers, and artists, among others.\\n\\nFernando Botero, who had been one of the campaign managers for Samper, was named Minister of Defense. Horacio Serpa, another of Samper's political allies during campaigning, was named Minister of Interior. When news of the investigation were leaked to the press, Samper appointed them to face the media and aggressively deny the possibility that drug money entered the finances of the presidential campaign. The message was clear: if money from the Cali drug cartel found its way into the campaign's finances, Samper had no notion of this. During a press conference in which both men referred to and disqualified key elements of the investigation, one of the journalists asked them how they had obtained this document, since it was a confidential document that only the prosecutor had the authority to release once the evidence was collected. Serpa said it was given to them by an \"anonymous source\".\\n\\nAfter many months numerous politicians and top members of the government were indicted, but only scapegoats were convicted. Botero was arrested in connection to the investigation and charged with conspiracy to illicitly gain wealth. Santiago Medina, the campaign's treasurer, was arrested, convicted and sentenced to prison as a result of the investigation. Other political figures, such as Alberto Santofimio Botero, Eduardo Mestre, journalist Alberto \"el loco\" Giraldo, were also imprisoned under the same investigation. Giraldo spoke on behalf of the Cali cartel in many of the tape recordings. The prosecutor also charged Samper, who insisted on his innocence. He said that if drug money had entered the presidential campaign, it had done so \"behind his back\".\\n\\nCardinal Pedro Rubiano, a leader of Colombia's Catholic Church, stated in an interview that not knowing that drug money financed part of the presidential campaign was similar to not noticing an elephant entering one's living room. Since then, the events that led to drug money financing the \"Samper for President\" campaign have been referred to as \"The Elephant\".\\n\\nAs outlined by the Colombian Constitution, only Congress can serve as the President's natural judge. So, once the Prosecutor General presented the case and delivered the evidence to the Congress, it was in the hands of the latter to evaluate the evidence and determine if Samper was also directly involved in this scandal. Congress is a political institution and at the time the majority of its members were political allies of Samper, many of whom had also been implicated in dealings with the Cali Cartel. It was no surprise that despite the evidence against Samper the case was precluded, that is neither guilty or innocent.\\n\\nAs a consequence of this political turmoil, the U.S. government withdrew any political assistance to Samper's government. For consecutive years, Samper's administration was lambasted by the US for its supposed failure to make every effort to effectively fight the war against cocaine and the Cali Cartel. Additionally, the US revoked Samper's visa and thereby effectively banned him from entering the country.\\n\\nFor a detailed timeline of the events regarding this investigation, see Procedure 8.000.\\n\\nIn July 2006, President Álvaro Uribe offered Samper Colombia's ambassadorship to France. This led to the resignation of former President and Ambassador of Colombia to the United States, Andrés Pastrana, who criticized the decision. Opposition was also expressed by the media, political groups and other parts of Colombian society. In the end, Samper did not accept the offer.\\n\\nErnesto was born on 3 August 1950 in Bogotá to Andrés Samper Gnecco y Helena Pizano Pardo. Among his siblings, Daniel stands out as a prolific writer and journalist, a trait not alien to the Samper family who come from a long line of writers. He married Silvia Arbelaez with whom he had one son Andrés. He divorced and later remarried to Jacquin Strouss Lucena on 16 June 1979, and out of this marriage were born Miguel and Felipe.\\n\\nSamper studied in the Gimnasio Moderno, a prestigious secondary school in Bogotá, and attended the Pontifical Xavierian University. Additionally, he conducted graduate studies in Economics at Columbia University while living in New York City.\\n\\n"}

He initially (unsuccessfully) sought a career as a radio announcer, but then approached Federal Studios looking for work as a songwriter, ending up recording his songs himself.Recording initially in an easy listening style, Smith's first chart success came in the late 1960s with \"Bend Down\", which was followed by Jamaican number one hits in \"Ride On Sammy,\" \"One Dream,\" and \"Pitta Patta\", all produced by Richard Khouri at Federal, the latter based on Lee \"Scratch\" Perry's \"Musical Transplant\" rhythm, which was voted the best song of the year in Swing magazine. In 1972, he won the Yamaha Music Festival in Japan with \"Life Is Just For Living\", a song originally written for a Red Stripe commercial. In 1973, he was honoured by the Jamaican government with The Badge Of Honour For Meritorious Service In The Field Of Music. An album, Life Is Just For Living followed in 1974 on Trojan Records. \"Pitta Patta\" was followed by further Jamaican hits with \"Duppy or Gunman\" and \"Key Card\". Smith also had success with covers of popular songs such as \"Help Me Make It Through The Night\" and \"Everything I Own\", and as a songwriter had success at the Festival Song Contest in 1974 with Tinga Stewart's \"Play De Music\". Smith's \"Tears On My Pillow (I Can't Stand It)\" topped the UK Singles Chart in 1975 when recorded by Johnny Nash. In 1976 his \"The Power and the Glory\" was seen by some as a criticism of Prime Minister Michael Manley's policies, and led to threats on his life, prompting him to relocate with his family to Toronto, Canada, where he recorded the albums To Behold Jah and Skareggae. In the late 1970s, Smith largely appealed to older audiences and released Gospel-influenced records such as 1978's I'll Sing For Jesus album. In 1981, Smith moved to Miami to be closer to his wife and children, later moving to Fort Lauderdale, but was beset by financial difficulties and cocaine and alcohol problems. Smith found help in the form of Bob Marley's mother, Cedella Booker, who he collaborated with as a songwriter, and in 1987, film director Perry Henzell asked Smith to write songs for his Marcus Garvey musical. Smith returned to Jamaica in the wake of Hurricane Gilbert, and began recording and performing again, initially with a new band, The New Agenda. In 1996, he released the Dancehall Ernie Cleans It Up album, featuring new recordings of some of his best known songs.\\n\\nIn 2008, Smith returned with Country Mile, an album that was preceded by the singles \"That's The Kinda People We Are\" (a duet with Pluto Shervington) and \"Give Her a Lion\" (featuring Ron Muschette).\\n\\n"}

Her childhood was affected by the sect's suspicion of outsiders,  the division that took place in that FLDS in the 1970s and '80s and by the increasing strictness of the sect her family belonged to. She experienced life with a mother who suffered from depression and was violent with her children. She observed conflict between her parents over celebrating Christmas  and the effect of her surroundings and the strictness of the sect on her mother's mental condition and on her mother's relationship with her husband . Importantly for later, she observed and learned how to work round her mother's mood swings  and how other children reacted to spanking so as to mitigate the violence but she also learned from her grandmother to take great pride in her church's tradition of plural marriage .\\n\\nCarolyn wanted to go to College and study medicine  but when her father went to seek permission for her to go to College, the condition was that she marry Merril Jessop. . It was arranged that she marry Jessop in two days, and to prevent her running away, she had to sleep in her parents' bedroom . She wrote, \"The idea of sexual or physical contact with a man thirty-two years my senior was terrifying \" Merril Jessop already had three other wives .\\n\\nThe book describes Jessop's experience of a loveless and dysfunctional plural marriage, her eight pregnancies, four of which were life threatening and the last of which very nearly killed her. It reveals how her ambitions were thwarted, her growing disillusionment with her husband, her conflict with Merril Jessop's older daughters and the other wives and how, step by step, she rejected the beliefs of the sect. When she decided that her only option was to escape, the book reveals her meticulous planning and her willingness to seize the moment. The book also reveals the determination of the sect to control and suppress dissent in its ranks.\\n\\nAfter Carolyn Jessop escaped with her eight children, the book describes her challenges in evading sect members who went looking for her and the children, how she won legal custody of her children, how she coped with post-traumatic stress and how she helped the children to adapt to life in the wider community. This was complicated by the fact that her eldest daughter, who was her father's favorite, was opposed to what her mother had done and was determined to return to the community. Her eldest son was also torn between loyalty to his mother and father. Jessop used her eldest son as bait to serve court papers on his father. Despite this, she was able to preserve her relationship with her son and he decided to become a pilot and break his ties with the sect. With the younger children she systematically weaned them away from the beliefs of the sect and into a more mainstream way of life. \\n\\nThe book reveals how others rallied round and helped Carolyn, and how the sect did its best to get her and the children back.\\n\\nThe book is published by Random House under the Doubleday/Broadway Books imprint and is also available in an audio format.\\n\\n"}

The Ballad of Eskimo Nell a.k.a The Sexy Saga of Naughty Nell and Big Dick , is a 1975 British film directed by Martin Campbell and produced by Stanley Long. Though inspired by \"The Ballad of Eskimo Nell\", the movie owes little to the original bawdy song.\\n\\nIn Campbell's film, a writer, a producer and a director are hired by seedy erotic film producer Benny U. Murdoch (Roy Kinnear) to make a dirty movie based on the poem. However, they run into difficulty when each of the production's backers want a completely different style of film made. Then Murdoch makes off with the money, and the three have to produce four different versions of the movie to keep everybody happy - a gay Western, a hardcore porno, a family version and a Kung Fu-style production.\\n\\nMany of the film's characters are based on real personalities of the time, Lady Longhorn and Lord Coltwind the backers of the wholesome family version are thinly veiled caricatures of Mary Whitehouse and Lord Longford. While Benny U. Murdoch is loosely based on Tony Tenser, head of Tigon films. A more obscure figure the film ridicules is Louis “Deke” M. Heyward, the London representative of AIP (American International Pictures) who had previously clashed with the film's writer, Michael Armstrong. during the making of Armstrong’s directing debut, The Haunted House of Horror, in 1969. In Eskimo Nell, Heyward is parodied as “Big Dick”, a crass, foul-mouthed American producer from “A.W.P Films”, and the backer of the hardcore porno version.

{"title": "Esox", "body": "Esox is a genus of freshwater fish, the only living genus in the family Esocidae — the esocids which were endemic to North America, Europe and Eurasia during the Paleogene through present from 65—0 mya, existing for approximately .\\n\\nThe type species is E. lucius, the northern pike. The species of this genus are known as pike and pickerel, and in heraldry they are usually called lucy.\\n\\nThe big pike species are native to the Palearctic and Nearctic ecozone, ranging across northern North America and from Western Europe to Siberia in Eurasia. They have been found in many urban lakes in Western Europe, reported to be in the Rostrum (Lucerne) and the Serpentine, (London).\\n\\nPike can grow to a maximum recorded length of , reaching a maximum recorded weight of . The UK record pike of  was caught on a Creek Chub Pikie lure by Roy Lewis at Llandegfedd Reservoir in Wales in 1992. Individuals have been reported to reach 30 years in age. All pike over  in body weight are females. They have the elongated, torpedo-like form of predatory fishes, with sharply-pointed heads and sharp teeth. Their coloration is typically grey-green with a mottled or spotted appearance with stripes along their back, perfectly camouflaged among weeds. Individual pike marking patterns are unique, like fingerprints. \\n\\nThe generic name Esox (pike fish) derives from the Greek ίσοξ (a kind of fish), itself a word of Celtic origin related to the Welsh eog and Irish Gaelic iach (salmon). Pliny uses the Latin form esox in reference to a large fish in the Rhine normally identified with lax (salmon). It is likely that Carolus Linnaeus's application of Esox to the pike is thus a misnomer.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe English common name \"pike\" is an apparent shortening of \"pike-fish\", in reference to its pointed head, Old English píc originally referring to a pickaxe. The plural of pike is pike.\\n\\nA northern English and Lowland Scots name for the pike, ged, similarly derives from Old Norse gaddr (spike) (cf. the modern Swedish name for the pike, gädda, the Danish \"gedde\", the Norwegian \"gjedde\" and Scottish Gaelic: geadais). The Dutch name for the pike (snoek) has been given to a wide variety of fish reminding sailors of the pike (see snoek, snook).\\n\\nThe English \"pike\" originally referred specifically to the adult fish, the diminutive form \"pickerel\" (now used to name some of the smaller pike, E. americanus and E. niger) referring to the young. The walleye (Sander vitreus) is sometimes called a pickerel by Gerard, but it is unrelated to the pike, being a member of the perch family (family Percidae). Pike are not to be confused with the unrelated pikeminnows (traditionally, and perhaps better, known as squawfish) of genus Ptychocheilus (family Cyprinidae) or pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) which is more akin to walleye than to pike. Pike are also called \"Jackfish\" in North America and informally \"Slough Shark\" in Western Canada.\\n\\nthumbPike feed on a wide range of food sources, predominantly smaller shoal fish. Pike are also cannibalistic, sometimes preying upon smaller members of their own species. \\n\\nThey will also prey on insect and amphibian such as newt or frog in times when their usual food is scarce, and occasionally on small mammal like moles or mice when caught water-borne. Small birds such as duckling may become a target for hungry pike. Pike are also known to prey on swimming snake.\\n\\nThey are, however, undeserving of their reputation for being overly vicious predators. There are few substantiated incidents of pike 'attacks' on people. Pike's further reputation as a pest seems to lie predominately amongst anglers who seek more desirable species.\\n\\nthumbthumb\\n\\nEffective methods for catching this hard-fighting fish include dead baits, live baits and lure fishing. Pike can easily be damaged when handled since they are not as robust as their reputation would suggest. Colour of lure can be influenced by water clarity and weather conditions. Since pike have numerous sharp teeth it is wise to take extreme care when unhooking them. The use of a wet leather gauntlet and surgical forceps to remove hooks is highly recommended on safety grounds. If practising catch and release fishing, care for the pike should be the pike angler's utmost concern. The formerly recommended practice of grasping a pike by its eye sockets (tragically interpreted as \"its eyes\") resulted in countless released pike that quickly died from inability to see prey any longer.\\n\\nThe current recommended method of grasping pike is to close the hand firmly over the gill covers, and to make the period of handling as short as possible before release. Grabbing a pike by the gill covers is not feasible when a pike is very big, but it is easy to handle a pike by inserting the fingers at the bottom of the gill opening and grabbing the lower jaw. Big pike should also be supported at the belly. When a pike is held this way it is also easier to keep the mouth open to remove a hook. Many anglers now use special grips to grab the pike's front lower jaw, which can add to the safety of an anglers because of the danger imposed by the hooks of the lure or tackle and the pike's teeth. The Pike Anglers Club was formed in 1977 to campaign for the preservation of pike and the sport of pike fishing.\\n\\nA practice known as 'gut hooking' was previously widely used in catching pike. Upon taking the bait the pike will hold it for a short time in its mouth as it moves off. The pike will then, usually, turn the bait in its mouth so that it sits in alignment with its throat to ease swallowing. It is recommended that when pike fishing the process is not allowed to go this far and a strike is recommended as soon as a bite is indicated. For this it is necessary to attach hooks on the head side as well as the middle of the baitfish. Otherwise what is known as 'gut hooking' will result which will normally kill or seriously injure the fish. Dutch research shows that cutting the line immediately when the fish is gut hooked will still give low mortality (14%). The hooks in the gut or stomach were either encapsulated or removed from the body.\\n\\nOther methods of catching and handing pike that are now frowned upon are the gaff and the gag. The gaff is a metal hook on the end of a pole used to hook through the fish's body in place of a more humane landing net. A gag is a device for holding open the pike's mouth whilst unhooking. These are now illegal in Scotland, as they put a huge amount of pressure on a pike's jaw, thus causing irreparable damage.\\n\\nCatching a 10 kg pike, kymppihauki, is considered as \"earning one's spurs\" as a master fisherman in Finland.\\n\\nthumb In the Finnish Kalevala, Väinämöinen creates a kantele (string instrument) from the jawbone of the pike.\\n\\nRussian mythology holds that the pike is one of several forms assumed by evil water spirits called vodyanoy, and a ravenous mythical pike is traditionally blamed for decimating the fish population in the Sheksna River. Russian fairy tales, on the other hand, also tell about an old wise pike that can fulfil wishes of the one who catches it, if its catcher releases it back into its habitat. \\n\\nIn the beginning of Boris and Arkady Strugatsky Monday Begins on Saturday a wise centuries-old pike appears in the story when main character Sasha arrives at Baba Yaga's house in Solovets.\\n\\nIn the 10th episode of Monarch of the Glen series 3, Hector MacDonald fights a pike that has infiltrated his loch and has eaten all the fish.\\n\\nIn the book Redwall, Cluny the Scourge has only one eye, the other having been lost to a pike who was then killed by Cluny.\\n\\nThe name of the Soviet Shchuka class submarine, active during the Second World War, is derived from \"Shchuka\" - Russian for \"pike\".\\n\\nTwo United States Navy submarine have been named Pike, SS-6 of 1903 and SS-173 of 1935, and three, SS-22 of 1912, SS-177 of 1936, and SS-524 of 1944, named Pickerel. In addition, the Soviet submarines known to NATO as the Victor III class were called the Shchuka (Щука, \"pike\") class, in Russian. The Soviet Iosif Stalin tank (IS-3) was also nicknamed Shchuka, in reference to its sharply pointed hull front.\\n\\nthumb thumbIn heraldry, the pike is called a lucy. It is usually blazon either naiant (swimming), embowed (bowed) or hauriant (jumping), though pairs of lucies may appear addorsed (back to back), as in the arms of the Finnish town of Uusikaupunki, Finland.

The settlement was created on 25 February 1906, as an extension of the Colonia 16 de Octubre, now known as Trevelin.\\n\\nThe city, the main town of the area, is located by the Esquel Stream and surrounded by the mountains La Zeta, La Cruz, Cerro 21 and La Hoya. La Hoya is known as a ski resort with good quality snow right through the spring. The Los Alerces National Park is  northwest of the city.\\n\\nthumbAnother important tourist attraction is the narrow-gauge train (with 75 cm between the rails), known as La Trochita locally and in English as The Old Patagonian Express, after the book by Paul Theroux. It is said to be the only narrow-gauge long-distance train in operation and the southernmost railway in the world. The first fifty locomotives were brought from Germany (Henschel &amp; Sohn) in 1922 and were originally modified to use fuel oil and steam. Later twenty-five locomotives were bought from the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia. The train remains in operation and authentic thanks to the effort of the team of workers at Talleres Ferroviarios El Maiten, that make a lot of pieces and parts by hand. The trains now run as a tourist excursionbetween Esquel and the small settlement of Nahuel Pan, located at the foot of the volcano of the same name, with other services all the way to El Maitén. Until 1993, the train ran all the way to the city of Ingeniero Jacobacci in Río Negro, from where trains ran to Viedma and from there to Buenos Aires, forming the General Roca railway.\\n\\nAccording to the , the Esquel district had about 28,000 inhabitants, with one of the highest rates of growth in the province, mainly as result of the immigration of people from Buenos Aires, but also from other provinces.\\n\\nThe townspeople have been in a long battle to prevent a gold mine being set up nearby, with concerns that the metal extraction will contaminate the watercourse permanently and irreversibly.\\n\\nIn May 2009, Esquel twinned with Aberystwyth in Wales; with representatives of the Welsh town traveling to Argentina to participate in the signing of a charter formalising the link.\\n\\nIn 1951 a farmer found a  meteorite, later called Esquel, while digging a hole for a water tank.

{"title": "Eteenpäin", "body": "Eteenpäin (\"Forward\") was a Finnish-language daily newspaper launched in New York City in 1921. The paper was the East Coast organ of Finnish-American members of the Communist Party USA. The paper moved to Worcester, Massachusetts in 1922 and to Yonkers, New York in 1931. In 1950 Eteenpäin was merged with the Communist Party's Midwestern Finnish-language daily, Työmies (\"The Worker\") to create Työmies-Eteenpäin, which continued to be published from Superior, Wisconsin into the 1990s.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1919 the Socialist Party of America (SPA), amidst much acrimony, split into three parts at its 1919 Emergency National Convention. Two new Communist Parties were established, with the moderate Socialist \"Regulars\" retaining control of the old party name, logo, and assets. In the run-up to this landmark party convention the SPA's governing National Executive Committee had suspended six large foreign language federations for having officially endorsed the Left Wing Manifesto around with the soon-to-be Communist Party dissidents were organizing their forces. This action, coupled with the revocation of the state charters of \"left wing\" dominated states such as Ohio, Michigan, and Massachusetts, deprived the left wing of its voting majority and assured the Regulars of victory at the convention in Chicago.\\n\\nThis heavy-handed action taken against the non-English-speaking section of the Socialist Party came at a severe cost, however. Even though the Finnish Socialist Federation (SSJ), long regarded as one of the strongest bones in the Socialist Party's body, was not one of those endorsing the Left Wing Manifesto and thus incurring the NEC's wrath, many in the organization were sympathetic to the revolutionary socialist pronouncements of the Left Wing Manifesto and were disgusted by the actions of the NEC.\\n\\nAt its 6th National Convention, held in Waukegan, Illiniois from December 25, 1920 to January 2, 1921, the Finnish Socialist Federation after much heated debate voted 16-5 to withdraw from the Socialist Party of America and to continue instead its existence as an independent organization.\\n\\nUpon learning of the decision of the Waukegan Convention to separate the Finnish Socialist Federation from the party, Socialist Party Executive Secretary Otto Branstetter immediately set about reorganizing a new Finnish Federation for the Socialist Party, an idea which had much support among the branches of the more moderate Eastern District of the Finnish Socialist Federation. In August 1921 a convention was held in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, home of the Eastern District's daily newspaper, Raivaaja (\"The Pioneer\") and a new Finnish Socialist Federation organized. \\n\\nA large percentage of the Eastern District of the old Finnish Socialist Federation left that organization and joined the reorganized Finnish Socialist Federation affialiated with the SPA, bringing with them their newspaper, Raivaaja. The independent SSJ still had three regular and well established newspapers — the daily Työmies (\"The Worker\"), published in the Upper Midwest, and the weeklies Toveri (\"The Comrade\") and Toveritar (\"The Woman Comrade\"), published in Oregon. Despite this fact the radical Finnish-Americans of the East still felt they needed a newspaper published at a closer proximity to cover news of local concern and to this end they launched a new publication entitled Eteenpäin (\"Forward\").\\n\\nEteenpäin was launched in New York City on May 25, 1921 under the editorship of Elis Sulkanen, until recently the editor of Toveri. In an effort to reduce expenses, the publication moved from New York to Worcester, Massachusetts in 1922. There was also a name change of the publisher at this time, with the initial \"Bothnia Press Inc.\" giving way to the \"Eteenpäin Co-operative Society.\" \\n\\nThe paper was typically four pages in length and strongly ideological in its coverage of the news.\\n\\nThere was some limited Finnish presence in the underground Communist Party of America — a shade over 400 dues-paying members by the end of 1921. This number was quite limited and its expansion difficult, however. In the estimation of Finnish Communist leader John Wiita (best known by the pseudonym \"Henry Puro\"), may Finnish-Americans were suspicious of illegal revolutionary propaganda activities, which they considered outlandish. Eteenpäin editor Elis Sulkanen, himself a participant in the underground Communist movement of 1920-1923, similarly noted that most radical Finns had no desire to join the underground organization, instead seeking to participate in a legal organization realistically participating in the actual politics of the United States.\\n\\nIt was not until the establishment of the above ground and \"legal\" Workers Party of America (WPA) around New Year's Day of 1922 that Finnish radicals entered the communist movement en masse. The main body of the Finnish Socialist Federation ended its year of independent existence and joined the new WPA as a group at the time of the organization's founding convention, held in New York City. The Finns soon comprised the largest component of the WPA, outnumbering native English speakers and representing 40% of the total party membership by 1923.\\n\\nEteenpäin became a part of the WPA at this juncture and it remained a Communist Party publication throughout its nearly three decades of existence.\\n\\nEteenpäin had a circulation of nearly 7,300 in 1924. By 1930, its press run averaged just shy of 11,000 copies per issue.\\n\\nA number of leading figures in the radical Finnish-American political movement were editors or managers of Eteenpäin over the years, including original editor Sulkanen (later the author of an encyclopedic history of Finnish-American socialism), William Marttila, Toivo Vuorela, Onni Saari, K.E. Heikkinen, and John Wiita (Henry Puro).\\n\\nIn 1931 the publication moved to Yonkers, New York, where it was published by a new holding company called \"American Finnish Publishers, Inc.\"\\n\\nThe publishers of Eteenpäin also issued a number of other Finnish-language radical publications over the years, including a Marxist theoretical magazine Viesti (\"The Message\"), a magazine directed at women called Työläisnainen (\"The Working Woman\"), and the annuals Punainen Kalenteri (\"Red Calendar\"), Vappu (\"May Day\"), and Työmiehen Joulu (\"Worker's Christmas\").\\n\\nIn 1950, Eteenpäin was essentially dissolved when it was merged into Työmies, with the \"new\" joint publication (called Työmies-Eteenpäin) being published from Työmies' Superior, Wisconsin offices. This paper continued through 1995, when it was replaced by the English-language publication, The Finnish-American Reporter.\\n\\nEteenpäin has been preserved almost in its totality. Microfilm of Työmies-Eteenpäin (1950–1995) is available from the Wisconsin Historical Society at the University of Wisconsin.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eternal derby (Serbia)", "body": "The Eternal derby (, Večiti derbi) also called the Belgrade derby is a match between the fiercest city rivals Red Star and Partizan, two of the biggest and most popular sports societies in Serbia. Rivalry is present in a number of different sports but the most intensive matches are between football, basketball, volleyball and handball sections of both societies.\\n\\nThese two teams are the by far most popular in the country. According to a 2007 survey (sponsored by Red Star), nearly 50% of the population supports Red Star, while about 32% supports Partizan. The clubs are also the most popular ones in Montenegro and Republika Srpska, the Serb entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina. They have supporters in all other former Yugoslav republics and these fans are in majority Serbs living in those countries.\\n\\nDerby games were always greatly anticipated and quite spectacular, but in recent years the lower quality of football that’s been displayed, as well as large amount of violence and hooliganism, made the fall of the attendance an inevitable consequence. The biggest attendance was about 108,000 spectators at the Red Star Stadium.\\n\\nRed Star fans traditionally occupy northern stands of both stadiumsPartizan fans traditionally occupy southern stands of both stadiumsProbably the best known thing about the Belgrade derby are the fans. Usually, they are much more exciting to watch than the game itself. Especially in recent times, since the Serbian football championship has at times lacked in quality. Fans create an impressive atmosphere with loud cheering and original choreography. Both sides prepare intensely between the matches, make large flags and special messages that are appropriate for that particular occasion, to be usually directed towards the opposing side.\\n\\nPartizan's supporters, known as Grobari ( or ), were formed in 1970. The nickname itself was given by their biggest rivals the Red Star fans, referring to club's mostly black colours which were similar to official uniforms of cemetery undertakers. The other theory is that the name arrives from the Partizan's stadium street name - Humska (rough English translation might be Graves). First groups of organized Partizan fan supporters began to visit the JNA stadium in the late 1950s. Partizan's participation in the 1966 European Cup Final attracted much more fans to the stadium and is considered to be the crucial moment of the organized fans moving to a south stand of the stadium where they are gathering up to this day. During the 1970s as well as all over Europe, the Grobari started bringing fan equipments to the stadiums such as supporting scarfs, transparents, flags and flame torches, which gave a whole new aspect to their sport club supporting. By the 1980s the Grobari were one of the four main fan groups in SFR Yugoslavia and began outmarching to all Partizan's games across the country and Europe. Because of their expressed hooliganism toward other club's supporters in those times, fans who represented the core of the Grobari firm were often called among themselves \"Riot Squad\". They were best known for their English style of supporting which was mainly based on loud and continuous singing. Today, the Grobari consist of three large groups: Južni Front, Grobari 1970 and Grobari Beograd.\\n\\nSupporters of the various Red Star sports teams are known as Delije (, Delije). Delije is plural of the singular form delija, a word that entered the Serbian language during the Turkish Ottoman occupation of Serbia which nowadays means brave handsome and even young man.The name Delije first began to be used by hardcore Red Star supporters during late 1980s, with official inauguration taking place on January 7, 1989.\" Up to that point, the diehard Red Star fans were scattered amongst 7-8 fan groups that shared the north stand at the Red Star Stadium (known colloquially as Marakana), most prominent of which were Red Devils, Zulu Warriors, and Ultras. As a sign of appreciation the Red Star Football Club painted the word Delije in block letters across their stadium's north stand - the gathering point of the club's most loyal and passionate fans. They are also called Cigani (English: Gypsies) by their arch rivals Grobari, fans of Partizan. Although, Delije generally considered the name Cigani to be insulting, they occasionally use this name in their own songs and chants. Today, Delije-Sever consist of five larger groups: Ultras RSB, Ultra Boys, Belgrade Boys, Heroes, Brigate and much other fanatical supporters all around Serbia and beyond.\\n\\nIncidents involving both fan groups as well as riot police can be seen before, during and after derby games. The biggest incident occurred on October 30, 1999 at the Stadion FK Partizan, when a 17 year old Red Star fan was killed by a signal rocket fired from Grobari's stand. More recently, fights between two rival groups are not necessarily connected with match day. In one of these arranged fights in 2006, between younger fans armed with knives, a Partizan fan was stabbed to death by a Red Star fan.\\n\\nRed Star was formed on March 4, 1945 by \"United alliance of anti-fascist Youth\" of Serbian new civil authorities in Yugoslavia. Partizan was founded on October 4, 1945 as a club of Yugoslav People's Army. Although Belgrade had its football club before World War II - BSK, which was very successful in pre-war Yugoslav championships, these clubs became popular very fast, not just in Belgrade but in all of Serbia. The first match between these football sections was played on January 5, 1947 and Red Star won 3-4.\\n\\nRed Star is the only Serbian club that has won a UEFA competition, winning the 1991 European Cup in Bari, Italy. The same year in Tokyo, Japan the club won the Intercontinental Cup and lost the European Super Cup finals to the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup champion Manchester United where only one match was played in Manchester of two supposed, because of UN sport sanctions imposed on Serbia that lasted couple of years and influenced much more to later Red Star Europen success. The club also made 1979 UEFA Cup Final, losing to Borussia Mönchengladbach. Red Star has also won a record 25 national league titles, 23 national Cups, Danube Cup in 1958. and Mitropa Cup in 1968. And among many records Red Star has the most during unbeaten record in the league, and winning streak of 17 games in a row.\\n\\nPartizan participated in the first ever 1955-56 European Cup game that took place on September 3, 1955 in Lisbon against Sporting. The final result of this game was 3-3. Partizan also became the first club from Eastern Europe to have played in 1966 European Cup Final, losing it to Real Madrid 1-2, after eliminating Manchester United in the semifinals. In more recent years, the club played in the 2003-04 UEFA Champions League season, after eliminating Newcastle United on the penalties in the last qualifying round and also in the 2010-11 UEFA Champions League season after eliminating R.S.C. Anderlecht again on penalties in the last qualifying round. Partizan has won 22 national league titles, 11 national Cups, Mitropa Cup in 1978. and national Supercup in 1989.\\n\\nMain articles: Stadion FK Partizan and Stadion FK Crvena zvezda \\n\\nWhen host is Partizan, the derby is played at the Stadion FK Partizan, formerly known as Stadion JNA which is still the common name for the stadium.

{"title": "Ethanol precipitation", "body": "Ethanol precipitation is a method used to purify and/or concentrate RNA, DNA and polysaccharide such as pectin and xyloglucan from aqueous solutions.\\n\\nthumbDNA is polar due to its highly charged phosphate backbone. This polarity, based on the principle of \"like dissolves like\", makes it soluble in water, which is also highly polar.\\n\\nThe high polarity of water, reflected by high value of its dielectric constant 80.1 (at 20 °C), means that electrical force between any two charge in aqueous solutions is highly diminished compared to force in vacuum or air.\\n\\nThis relation is reflected in Coulomb's law, which can be used to calculate force acting on two charges  and  separated by a distance , the dielectric constant  (also called relative static permittivity) of the medium is present in the denominator of the equation ( is an electric constant):\\n\\nAt an atomic level this diminishing of force acting on charges results from water molecules forming hydration shell around them. It makes water a very good solvent for charged compounds like salts. Electric force which normally holds salt crystal together by way of ionic bonds is weakened in the presence of water allowing ions to separate from the crystal and spread through solution.\\n\\nThe same mechanism operates in the case of negatively charged phosphate groups on DNA backbone, even if positive ions are present in solution, the relatively weak electric force prevents them from forming stable ionic bonds with phosphates and precipitating out of solution.\\n\\nEthanol is much less polar than water, its dielectric constant is 24.3 (at 25 °C). This means that adding ethanol to solution disrupts screening of charges by water. If enough ethanol is added electrical attraction between phosphate groups and any positive ions present in solution becomes strong enough to form stable ionic bonds and precipitate DNA. This usually happens when ethanol makes around above 64% of the solution. As the mechanism suggests solution has to contain positive ions for precipitation to occur, usually Na, NH or Li play this role.\\n\\nthumbDNA is precipitated by first ensuring that the correct concentration of positive ions is present in solution (too much will result in a lot of salt co-precipitating with DNA, too little will result in incomplete DNA recovery) and then adding two to three volumes of at least 95% ethanol. Many protocols advise storing DNA at low temperature at this point but this has been shown to lower precipitation efficiency . The best efficiency is achieved at room temperature but when possible degradation is taken into account it is probably best to incubate DNA on wet ice. Optimal incubation time depends on the length and concentration of DNA. Smaller fragments and lower concentrations will require longer times to achieve the same recovery. For very small lengths and low concentrations over-night incubation is recommended. In such cases use of carriers like tRNA, glycogen or linear polyacrylamide can greatly improve recovery.\\n\\nDuring incubation DNA and some salts will precipitate from solution, in the next step this precipitate is collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge tube at high speeds (~12,000g). Time and speed of centrifugation has the biggest effect on DNA recovery rates. Again smaller fragments and higher dilutions require longer and faster centrifugation. Centrifugation can be done either at room temperature or in 4 °C or 0 °C.During centrifugation precipitated DNA has to move through ethanol solution to the bottom of the tube, lower temperatures increase viscosity of the solution and larger volumes make the distance longer, so both those factors lower efficiency of this process requiring longer centrifugation for the same effect.After centrifugation the supernatant solution is removed, leaving a pellet of crude DNA. Whether the pellet is visible depends on the amount of DNA and on its purity (dirtier pellets are easier to see) or the use of co-precipitants.\\n\\nIn the next step, 70% ethanol is added to the pellet, and it is gently mixed to break the pellet loose and wash it. This removes some of the salts present in the leftover supernatant and bound to DNA pellet making the final DNA cleaner. This suspension is centrifuged again to once again pellet DNA and the supernatant solution is removed. This step is repeated once.\\n\\nFinally, the pellet is air-dried and the DNA is resuspended in water or other desired buffer. It is important not to over-dry the pellet as it may lead to denaturation of DNA and make it harder to resuspend.\\n\\nIsopropanol can also be used instead of ethanol; the precipitation efficiency of the isopropanol is higher making one volume enough for precipitation. However, isopropanol is less volatile than ethanol and needs more time to air-dry in the final step. The pellet might also adhere less tightly to the tube when using isopropanol.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ethanolamine", "body": "Ethanolamine, also called 2-aminoethanol or monoethanolamine (often abbreviated as ETA or MEA), is an organic chemical compound that is both a primary amine (due to an amino group in its molecule) and a primary alcohol (due to a hydroxyl group). Like other amines, monoethanolamine acts as a weak base. Ethanolamine is a toxic, flammable, corrosive, color, viscous liquid with an odor similar to that of ammonia.\\n\\nEthanolamine is commonly called monoethanolamine or MEA in order to be distinguished from diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA). Ethanolamine is the second-most-abundant head group for phospholipid, substances found in biological membrane.\\n\\nMonoethanolamine is produced by reacting ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia; the reaction also produces diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The ratio of the products can be controlled by changing the stoichiometry of the reactants.\\n\\nNote that this reaction is exothermic and that controls are needed to prevent a runaway reaction.\\n\\nMEA is used in aqueous solutions for scrubbing certain acidic gas. It is used as feedstock in the production of detergent, emulsifiers, polishes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, chemical intermediates. For example, reacting ethanolamine with ammonia gives the commonly used chelating agent, ethylenediamine:\\n\\n400px\\n\\nIn pharmaceutical formulations, MEA is primarily used for buffering or preparation of emulsions.\\n\\nAqueous solutions of MEA (solutions of MEA in water) are used as a gas stream scrubbing liquid in amine treaters. For example, aqueous MEA is used to remove carbon dioxide (CO) from flue gas. Aqueous solutions can weakly dissolve certain kinds of gases from a mixed gas stream. The MEA in such solutions, acting as a weak base, then neutralizes acidic compounds dissolved in the solution to turn the molecule into an ion form, making them polar and considerably more soluble in a cold MEA solution, and thus keeping such acidic gases dissolved in this gas-scrubbing solution. Therefore, large surface area contact with such a cold scrubbing solution in a scrubber unit can selectively remove such acidic components as hydrogen sulfide (HS) and CO from some mixed gas streams. For example, basic solutions such as aqueous MEA or aqueous potassium carbonate can neutralize HS into hydrosulfide ion (HS) or CO into bicarbonate ion (HCO). \\n\\nHS and CO are only weakly-acidic gases. An aqueous solution of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) will not readily release these gases once they have dissolved. However, MEA is rather weak base and will re-release HS or CO when the scrubbing solution is heated. Therefore, the MEA scrubbing solution is recycled through a regeneration unit, which heats the MEA solution from the scrubber unit to release these only slightly-acidic gases into a purer form and returns the regenerated MEA solution to the scrubber unit again for reuse.\\n\\nEthanolamine is often used for alkalinization of water in steam cycles of power plants, including nuclear power plant with pressurized water reactor. This alkalinization is performed to control corrosion of metal components. ETA (or sometimes a similar organic amine, e.g., morpholine) is selected because it does not accumulate in steam generators (boilers) and crevices due to its volatility, but rather distributes relatively uniformly throughout the entire steam cycle. In such application, ETA is a key ingredient of so-called \"all-volatile treatment\" of water (AVT).\\n\\n"}

Ethyl acetoacetate is often used in the acetoacetic ester synthesis similar to diethyl malonate in the malonic ester synthesis or the Knoevenagel condensation. The protons alpha to carbonyl group are acidic, and the resulting carbanion can undergo nucleophilic substitution. A subsequent thermal decarboxylation is also possible. Similar to the behavior of acetylacetone, the enolate of ethyl acetoacetate can also serve as a bidentate ligand. For example, it forms purple coordination complex with iron(III) salts:\\n\\n"}

The human nose is capable of detecting this odor at a thousand times lower concentration than is considered harmful if continuously exposed for some period of time. \\n\\nEthyl acrylate can be prepared by several industrial methods. Acrylonitrile can be reacted with ethanol using sulfuric acid as a catalyst to produce ethyl acrylate. It may also be prepared from acetylene, carbon monoxide and ethanol.\\n\\nEthyl acrylate will readily polymerize upon standing and polymerization is accelerated by heat, light, and peroxide.\\n\\nEthyl acrylate is used in the production of polymers including resins, plastics, rubber, and denture material.\\n\\nEthyl acrylate's main safety issue arises from its being flammable and highly reactive.\\n\\nAlthough there are some reports claiming that ethyl acrylate is a carcinogen, major respected bodies regard the evidence of human carcinogenicity as weak and/or inconsistent. The International Agency for Research on Cancer stated, \"Overall evaluation, Ethyl acrylate is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).\" The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states, \"Human studies on occupational exposure to ethyl acrylate... have suggested a relationship between exposure to the chemical(s) and colorectal cancer, but the evidence is conflicting and inconclusive. In a study by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), increased incidences of squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas of the forestomach were observed in rats and mice exposed via gavage (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach). However, the NTP recently determined that these data were not relevant to human carcinogenicity and removed ethyl acrylate from its list of carcinogens.\" (Occupational exposure generally involves exposure that occurs regularly, over an extended period of time.)\\n\\nEthyl acrylate can irritate the nose, throat and lungs.\\n\\nOne favorable safety aspect is that ethyl acrylate has good warning properties; the odor threshold is much lower than any level of health concern. In other words, the bad odor warns people of ethyl acrylate's presence long before the concentration reaches a level capable of creating a serious health risk. Reports of the exact levels vary somewhat, but, for example, the U.S. E.P.A. reports an odor threshold of 0.0012 parts per million (ppm), but the E.P.A.'s lowest level of health concern, the Acute Exposure Guideline Level-1 (AEGL-1) is 8.3 ppm, which is almost 7000 times the odor threshold.\\n\\n"}

A recent edition to the scholarly literature is the American journal, Etruscan Studies: Journal of the Etruscan Foundation, which began publication in 1994. A more informal organ is Etruscan News and the accompanying cyber-publication Etruscan News Online. \\n\\nThomas Dempster (b. 1570, d. 1625), Scottish scholar and historian, is perhaps the godfather of Etruscology. Under the patronage of Grand Duke Cosimo II of Etruria, Dempster researched and wrote De Etruria Regali Libri Septem in Latin.\\n\\nProminent Etruscologists, past and present, include Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli, Massimo Pallottino, Mauro Cristofani, Giovanni Colonna, Giulio Giglioli, Giovannangelo Camporeale, L. Bouke van der Meer, George Dennis, Nancy T. DeGrummond, and Larissa Bonfante. Other scholars who focus more on the Etruscan influence on Rome include, R. E. A. Palmer, John F. Hall, and H. H. Scullard. \\n\\nVarious organizations promote Etruscology. The Etruscan Foundation supports Etruscan scholarship in the United States and abroad. The foundation provides internships and fellowships, and publishes the journal Etruscan Studies. It also sponsors an annual lecture.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ettore DeGrazia", "body": "Ettore \"Ted\" DeGrazia (June 14, 1909 – September 17, 1982) was an American impressionist, western-pop painter, sculptor, and lithographer. Self-described as \"the world's most reproduced artist\", DeGrazia is known for his pastel images of Native American children of the American Southwest and other Western scenes. \\n\\nBorn to an Italian copper miner in Morenci, Arizona Territory, DeGrazia's graduation from Morenci High School was delayed to the age of 23 by a four-year family trip to Italy beginning in 1920. In the early 1940s he studied under Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, assisting with murals at the Palacio Nacional and the Hospital de Jesus. The two artists sponsored an exhibit of his paintings at Palacio de Bellas Artes and the young artist was featured in Mexico City's Hoy Magazine. He returned to the University of Arizona, studying under Katherine Kitt where he received degrees in art and music.\\n\\nIn 1944, DeGrazia built his first gallery from adobe on the corner of Prince and Campbell Road in Tucson, Arizona. In 1951, he started work on what would become the DeGrazia Gallery in the Sun Historic District with the building of the Mission in the Sun and his home near the corner of Swan and Skyline roads. The DeGrazia Gallery in the Sun was built in 1965. Artists and friends who spent time at the new gallery included Thomas Hart Benton, Olaf Wieghorst, Jack Van Ryder, Pete Martinez and Ross Santee. In 2006, the  property, now a museum of DeGrazia's work, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \\n\\nDeGrazia's work first appeared in Arizona Highways magazine in 1941. In 1960, DeGrazia received a commission to produce cover art for UNICEF greeting cards. His designs have appeared on lithographs, collector plates, greeting cards, and in a series of Goebel figurines made by the same company that is famous for its Hummel figurines.\\n\\nIn 1976, Degrazia engaged in a protest against inheritance tax based on assessed market value of his work. The artist claimed the IRS rulings made him \"a millionaire on paper and my heirs will have to pay taxes for which there is no money.\" In his well-publicized protest, Degrazia rode horseback into the Superstition Mountains and burned 100 of his paintings.\\n\\n'''\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eucleian Society", "body": "The Eucleian Society is a student society begun at New York University in 1832. thumb\\n\\nIn 1832 sixteen students began the Eucleian Society at New York University, originally under the name “Adelphic Society”. After debate the name Eucleian was chosen in honor of Eukleia- εὔκλεια, the Goddess of Repute, Glory and War, associated with Artemis, the Goddess of the Hunt and protector of women and children. The Society had as a rival, the Philomathean Society at New York University. While both Societies forbade membership in their rival society, early records show that members were sometimes punished when discovered to be holding mutual membership and a few resigned to join the rival society.\\n\\nDuring the period of its founding, student societies such as Eucleian Society collected their own libraries and augmented their instruction by employing the noted minds of their day. Literary and debate societies offered a departure from the learn-by-rote instruction that prevailed in much of university instruction. Benefiting from a trust formed by A. Ogden Butler and family, the organization had a stable source of revenue. The Eucleian Society provided its membership at NYU with a library and augmented student instruction. The University gave the Society its own rooms at the Main University Building. The Eucleian Meeting Parlor was said to be \"fitted up in a style of taste and elegance highly creditable to the young gentlemen members.\"\\n\\nThe Constitution of the Eucleian Society as well as custom stressed secrecy among members. At some point it seems that even honorary membership was no longer a feature of the Society despite the fact several sitting American Presidents had accepted honorary membership in the Society.\\n\\nThe organization was well known enough in New York City to be announced in major newspapers in throughout the 19th century, despite of its habits of secrecy. On occasion Eucleians hosted open forums for important topics of the day, inviting lecturers of great popularity and fame. Politics, current affairs, literature (especially the Gothic and Romantic popular in the era), and university events seems to have been the most popular topics for internal essays, orations and discussions. The Society also employed repeated symbolism, allegory and other seemingly mystical allusions in its writings, none of which are fully explained in its writings. Until the turn of the 20th century, officers of the Eucleians also gave public speeches at commencement, apparently occupying a central position in those functions. This practice was ended to preserve the privacy of the Society's membership. thumb\\n\\nWhile there are some archived documents and older publications in circulation, there is very limited information about the Society as a result of its secrecy. In some of the archival records and internal records kept by the Society information has been removed, while other information is written in a kind of short hand, and even the name of the Society itself is omitted on many documents.\\n\\nLittle has been shared about the system or workings of the organization. The process of membership is said to take several months and to be multi-staged. The aim of the process has been described in general terms to create familiarity among the members and to inculcate the values of the Society. The primary values are excellence, faithfulness, development of the individual, mutual assistance in supporting each member's aspirations and social responsibility. Members are selected once or twice a year.\\n\\nTo date, the Society refuses to induct female members.\\n\\nIf anything could be said about the prevailing culture of the Society during its early era is that it tended to be “progressive”, supporting gender equality and abolition at an early juncture. Society members took an unusually keen interest in the plight and nature of Native Americans, hosting and producing a series of lectures and essays on the philosophy and nobility of the \"Indian Character\". Perhaps owing to influences from University leaders and advisors such as Rev. James M. Matthews and Theodore Frelinghuysen, a number of Society members became noted Protestant clergy and Protestant religious scholars.\\n\\nThe Society was a manifestation of student debate and literary societies that were popular prior to fraternities and sororities. It is not surprising that men on the Eucleian rolls gave rise to the Zeta Psi fraternity in 1847. These organizations were influenced by Freemasonry's moral code based on Enlightenment philosophy and ritualism. The William Morgan Affair which gave rise to anti-Masonic witch-hunts forced increased secrecy among fraternal organizations, undoubtedly affecting the ethos of secrecy among the Eucleian Society and like organizations.\\n\\nOne early lecturer became a very popular figure with the Society. Edgar Allan Poe was a repeated guest of the Eucleian, and lived on the Square; his poem \"The Raven\", which had given birth to his celebrity, also became popularly associated with the Society. In a fictional work based on New York University’s history of \"secret societies\" author Linda Fairstein uses the term “Raven Society”, noting that it was also used in references to a New York University literary society that had an association to Edgar Allan Poe. (There is also a Raven Society at the University of Virginia.) References in early yearbooks, and fraternity insignia that Ms. Fairstein cited gave rise to the use of \"Ravens\" or \"Raven Society\", as an alterne name though it is clear the Society rejects this as a formal name and deny Poe was a singular influence. ‎thumb\\n\\nTwo Society publications, The Medly and the Knickerbocker, became popular well beyond campus with New Yorkers in the mid 19th century through the 1920s. Much of the writing was humorous and satirical, finding its fodder in the events and figures of both campus and city. It is not entirely clear which members took part in writing the articles for these literary collections since members of the Society had taken to use nom de plumes. Some of the listed and identifiable writers of the Knickerbocker went on to write for the new Harper's Magazine reducing the Knickerbocker to a magazine only of student interest until it ended publication. Another circle of Washington Square writers originally associated with the Society (but expanded to non-members)took on the name Ravens in the 1930s to 1950s.\\n\\nIn the late 1930s and 1940s the Society became increasingly separate from the University despite having on-campus accommodations. Numbers in the organization dwindled in the 1940s as a result of World War II. Another cause for Eucleian’s lower profile seems to have been the perception of elitism by other NYU students. A quip in a yearbook of the era describes Eucleian as having membership that includes “John Quincy Adams, The Rockefellers, and that crowd”. (The organization did consist largely of the social \"elite\" of the time.) This alleged snobbery also became a theme of self effacing humor in the diminishing external publications of the Society in this era; the Society refers to itself, and presumably Andiron Club as \"the reclusive old Establishment\" in a 1930s NYU yearbook. This tongue-in-cheek reference had to do with the club not taking part as a unit in spirited student games, competitions and hazing of freshmen that occurred in the early fall at NYU.\\n\\nBy mid-20th century on to 1980s, membership also came to encompass New York area students, faculty and literati with and without New York University affiliation. It was at this time late Coleman O. Parsons, (a professor at Columbia and graduate of Columbia and Yale) became the first head of the group with no NYU affiliation.\\n\\nOther non-specific cultural manifestations, outside of the serious work of self and societal benefit have been noted; in a 1965 Club correspondence a description of the Eucleian claims a \"history of pranks in bad taste; formals in good taste and celebrations where taste is temporarily put aside.\"\\n\\nThe increased popularity of Greek letter fraternities in the 1950s and the anti-establishment sentiment of the 1960s (which was especially strong at NYU) diminished the Eucleian Society further. The Society widened its membership to all university schools (the Society had been primarily but never strictly an undergraduate organization). This was done possibly to buoy its prospects of survival. The practice had limited success, as attendance failed, affecting recruitment. Records (and lack thereof) seem to reveal years on end when there was no recruitment of new membership from student ranks during this era.thumbJoint meetings had always occurred with the avowed rival Society, Philomathean. By the early 20th century Philomathean had transformed itself into the Andiron Club which continued to profess a rivalry with the Eucleian Society, at least constitutionally. Despite this, the two organizations, removed from their once lofty and central positions in the NYU campus firmament, joined functions and crossed membership, as (increasingly public) membership lists attest to- eventually arriving at a level of synonymity. By mid-20th century on to 1980s, membership also came to encompass students, faculty and literati with and without University affiliation. Relaxed formality, ritual, etc. seems to have prevailed from the late 1960s onwards. NYU continued as the base of activity though membership was drawn from a wider community. During this era the Societies opened their doors to women membership. This continued through the time of the loss of the University Heights campus and the consolidation of New York University operations to Washington Square in the 1970s. In the reduced circumstances (without university recognition or the continued benefit of the Ogden Butler Trust) activities continued at least through the 1980s and 1990s, under the sponsorship of a faculty members from the English Departments at NYU and Columbia.\\n\\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, the remaining student membership of the organization attempted to revitalize its undergraduate operations as a senior society. During this time the organization functioned at various sites on campus, with the support of sympathetic faculty and for a time from rented rooms in the East Village. Secrecy seems to have been increased by design, in part because of differences with some alumni and faculty membership and partly to prevent what was seen as hostility towards independent student organizations.\\n\\nIt is not clear what the Society engages in today due to its strict policy of privacy. It is referenced in various underground student organizations and journals. In these limited statements or references the Society often appears critical of New York University administration, and various educational and social institutions. There are also allusions to its continued function as a literary, oration and debate society. Its historic documents also seem to describe what is a fraternal organization as well. Membership of the Society seems to be based on student (and faculty) achievements and activity in literature, oration, journalism, debate, (media and performing) arts, science, fraternity and sorority membership, athletics and government. Its membership also continues to be drawn from New York area universities.\\n\\nThere is a recent upswing in curiosity and pursuit of membership in Societies similar to the Eucleian. Partially it is lore and media attention to Societies like Skull and Bones, Quill and Dagger, Sphinx, Philomathean, St. Anthony Hall, and others. There are reasons beyond idle curiosity that attract students, with some serving as literary outlets, while most provide a venue to engage in varied topics of discussion, and the opportunity to share genuine fraternal values.\\n\\nAccessible lists of members of the Societies (Eucleian, Philomathean and Andiron) are traditionally limited, the criteria being whether members have passed or whether their names were published in the groups' public journals. All available lists reads as an impressive register of distinguished individuals in arts, literature, government, business, science and education. A sampling from available individuals yields these names among many other noted individuals.\\n\\nSaid author and researcher Kevin Phillips, “People have wondered why these secret societies have been hotbeds of future success. Rather than competing with fraternities and student organizations, these ‘secret societies’ augment or leverage other organizations. What makes them unique and singularly successful is that they stress goal oriented vision among a limited and distinguished group. Often they assist each other, secretly, in gaining prominent campus positions as practice for what they want to do in the real world. As opposed to larger organizations they maintain the strength of their ties throughout their lives.\"\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eudoxus of Cyzicus", "body": "Eudoxus of Cyzicus (fl. c. 130 BC) (Greek: Ευδοξος) was a Greek navigator who explored the Arabian Sea for Ptolemy VIII, king of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt.\\n\\nAccording to Poseidonius, later reported in Strabo's Geography, the monsoon wind system of the Indian Ocean was first sailed by Eudoxus of Cyzicus in 118 or 116 BC. Poseidonius said a shipwrecked sailor from India had been rescued in the Red Sea and taken to Ptolemy VIII in Alexandria. The unnamed Indian offered to guide Greek navigators to India. Ptolemy appointed Eudoxus of Cyzicus, who made two voyages from Egypt to India. The first, in 118 BC, was guided by the Indian sailor. After Eudoxus returned with a cargo of aromatics and precious stones a second voyage was undertaken in 116 BC. Eudoxus navigated the second voyage, sailing without a guide. Strabo, whose Geography is the main surviving source of the story, was skeptical about its truth. Modern scholarship tends to consider it relatively credible. During the 2nd century BC Greek and Indian ships met to trade at Arabian ports such as Aden (called Eudaemon by the Greeks). Attempts to sail beyond Aden were rare, discouraged, and involved a long and laborious coast-hugging journey. Navigators had long been aware of the monsoon winds. Indian ships used them to sail to Arabia, but no Greek ship had yet done so. For the Greeks to acquire the expertise of an Indian pilot meant the chance to bypass the Arabian ports and establish direct commercial links with India. Whether or not the story told by Poseidonius of a shipwrecked Indian pilot teaching Eudoxus about the monsoon winds is true, Greek ships were in fact soon using the monsoon winds to sail to India. By 50 BC there was a marked increase in the number of Greek and Roman ships sailing the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean.\\n\\nAnother Greek navigator, Hippalus, is sometimes credited with discovering the monsoon wind route to India. He is sometimes conjectured to have been part of Eudoxus's expeditions.\\n\\nWhen Eudoxus was returning from his second voyage to India the wind forced him south of the Gulf of Aden and down the coast of Africa for some distance. Somewhere along the coast of East Africa, he found the remains of a ship. Due to its appearance and the story told by the natives, Eudoxus concluded that the ship was from Gades (today's Cádiz in Spain) and had sailed south around Africa. This inspired him to attempt a circumnavigation of Africa. Organizing the expedition on his own account he set sail from Gades and began to work down the African coast. The difficulties were too great, however, and he was obliged to return to Europe.\\n\\nAfter this failure he again set out to circumnavigate Africa. His eventual fate is unknown. Although some, such as Pliny, claimed that Eudoxus did achieve his goal, the most probable conclusion is that he perished on the journey.\\n\\nEudoxus (under the Greek spelling of his name, Eudoxos) is the narrator of L. Sprague de Camp's historical novel The Golden Wind. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eugène François Vidocq", "body": "thumb\\n\\nEugène François Vidocq (; July 23, 1775 – May 11, 1857) was a French criminal and criminalist whose life story inspired several writers, including Victor Hugo and Honoré de Balzac. A former crook who subsequently became the founder and first director of the crime-fighting Sûreté Nationale as well as the head of the first known private detective agency, he is today considered by historians to be the father of modern criminology and of the French police. He is also regarded as the first private detective.\\n\\nEugène François Vidocq was born in the night from 23 to 24 July 1775 as the third child of the baker Nicolas Joseph François Vidocq (1744–1799) and his wife Henriette Françoise Vidocq (1744–1824, née Dion) in Arras in the Rue du Mirroir-de-Venise.\\n\\nLittle is known about the childhood of Vidocq, most of it from his ghost-written autobiography and a few documents in French archives. His father was well-educated and for those days very wealthy since he also operated as a corn dealer. Vidocq had six siblings: two older brothers (one of whom had already died at the time of Vidocq's birth), two younger brothers and two younger sisters.\\n\\nVidocq's teens were turbulent. He is described as being fearless, rowdy and cunning, very talented, but also very lazy. He spent much time in the armories (fighting halls) of Arras and acquired a reputation as a formidable fencer and the nickname \"le Vautrin\" (wild boar) By stealing, he provided himself with some level of comfort.\\n\\nWhen Vidocq was thirteen years old he stole his parent's silver plates but spent the money from them within one day. Three days after the theft he was arrested and brought to the local jail Baudets. Only ten days later he learned that his father was the one who arranged for the arrest to teach him a lesson. After a total of fourteen days he was dismissed from prison, but even this warning and further punishment could not tame him.\\n\\nBy age fourteen, he had stolen a large amount of money from the cash box of his parent's bakery and left the town for Ostend where he tried to embark to the Americas. But he was defrauded one night and thus found himself suddenly fundless. To survive, he hired himself out to a group of traveling entertainers. Despite regular beatings, he worked hard enough to get promoted from stable boy to fair-monster. In this role he had to play a Caribbean cannibal who eats raw meat, which he could not stomach for very long, so he switched to a group of puppeteer. However, he was banished from them because he flirted with the young wife of his employer. He then worked some time as an assistant of a peddler, but as soon as he neared the area of Arras he left for his parents in hope of forgiveness. He was welcomed by his mother with open arms.\\n\\nOn 10 March 1791 he enrolled in the Bourbon Regiment, where his reputation as a terrific fencer was confirmed. According to Vidocq, within six months he had challenged fifteen people to a duel and killed two men. Despite not being a model soldier and causing difficulties, he spent only a total of fourteen days in jail. During those two weeks Vidocq helped a fellow inmate successfully escape.\\n\\nthumbWhen France declared war against Austria on 20 April 1792, Vidocq had to participate in the battles during the First Coalition. For instance, he took part at the Battle of Valmy in September 1792. On 1 November 1792 he was appointed to corporal of the grenadier. But during his promotion ceremony he challenged a fellow non-commissioned officer to a duel. This sergeant major refused the duel, so Vidocq hit him. Striking a superior officer could have led to a death sentence (although a sergeant-major is not an officer), so he deserted from his regiment and enlisted in the 11th chasseur, of course concealing his history. On 6 November 1792 he fought under General Dumouriez in the Battle of Jemappes. \\n\\nIn April 1793, Vidocq was identified as a deserter. He had followed a general, who was fleeing after a failed martial coup, into the enemy camp. After a few weeks, Vidocq returned to the French camp. A chasseur-captain friend interceded for him, so he was allowed to return safely to the chasseurs. Finally, he resigned from the army because he was no longer welcome.\\n\\nHe was eighteen years old when he returned to Arras. He soon gained a reputation as a womanizer. Since his seductions often ended in duels, he was imprisoned in Baudets on 9 January 1794, where he was incarcerated until 21 January 1795.\\n\\nOn 8 August 1794, when he was barely 19, Vidocq married Anne Marie Louise Chevalier who was 5 days his senior, after she had feigned pregnancy. The marriage was not happy from the start and when Vidocq learned that his wife had cheated on him with the adjutant Pierre Laurent Vallain, he left again for the army. He did not see his wife again until their divorce in 1805.\\n\\nVidocq didn't stay long in the army. In autumn 1794, he spent most of his time in Brussels, which then was a hideout for crooks of all kinds. There he lived on small frauds. One day he was apprehended by the police, and as a deserter he had no valid papers. When asked for his identity he described himself as Mr. Rousseau from Lille and escaped while the police tried to confirm his statement.\\n\\nIn 1795 he joined - still under the name Rousseau - the armée roulante (English flying army). This army consisted of officers who in reality had neither officers' commissions nor a regiment. They were raiders, forging routes, ranks and uniforms, but staying away from the battlefields. Vidocq a.k.a. Rousseau began as a lieutenant of the chasseurs, but soon promoted himself to a hussar captain. In this role he met a rich widow in Brussels who became enamored of him. A conspirator of Vidocq made her believe that Vidocq was a young nobleman on the run because of the French revolution. Shortly before the planned wedding, Vidocq had scruples about the deception, and confessed to her. Then he left the city, but not without a generous cash gift from her.\\n\\nIn March 1795 Vidocq moved to Paris, where he squandered all his money on loose women. He went back to the North and joined a group of Bohemian gypsies, which he later left for a woman he fell in love with, a certain Francine Longuet. When Francine cheated on him with a soldier he beat both of them. The soldier sued him, upon which, in September 1795, Vidocq was sentenced to three months in prison. He was sent to the prison Tour Saint-Pierre in Lille for the period.\\n\\nVidocq was 20 and quickly adapted to life in prison and the usual practices. He befriended a group of men, one of them being Sebastien Boitel who had been sentenced to six years imprisonment for stealing. Then Boitel suddenly was released, but on the next day the local inspector noticed that the pardon was forged. Here starts the biggest controversy around Vidocq: Vidocq always claimed that he was completely innocent and not at all involved in the forging. Vidocq told the story as follows: two fellow inmates, Grouard, and Herbaux, had asked him to use his cell (as a soldier, Vidocq had a cell all to himself) for writing works of an unknown nature, because the common room was too noisy. Both inmates claimed however, that he helped in the fabrication and that the whole thing had been his idea. Thus Vidocq was not released after the three months.\\n\\nIn the next weeks Vidocq escaped several times with the help of Francine but always was captured soon again. During one of his escapes Francine caught him with another woman. He hid from her and when he finally was picked up again by police he learned that Francine had been found injured with multiple knife wounds. Suddenly he was not only accused of forgery but also attempted murder. It took some time until Francine conceded that the wounds were self-inflicted and the charge was dropped. Vidocq's contact with Francine stopped when she was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison for aiding the prison escapes.\\n\\nthumbAfter a long delay his trial for document forgery began. On 27 December 1796 Vidocq and a second accused, César Herbaux, were found guilty and sentenced to eight years of hard labour.\\n\\nthumbIn the prison of Bicêtre Vidocq was to wait several months for the transfer to the Bagne in Brest to labour in the galley. A fellow inmate taught him the martial art savate which later was often useful for him. An escape attempt on 3 October 1797 failed and precipitated his placement in a dungeon for eight days. Finally on 21 November the transport to Brest began. No opportunity for escape was afforded on the way, but as soon as he arrived in Brest he had a stroke of luck. On 28 February 1798 he escaped dressed as a sailor. Only a few days later he was apprehended due to a lack of papers, but the police did not recognize him as an escaped convict. He claimed to be Auguste Duval and while officials checked this claim he was put into a prison hospital. There he stole the habit of a nun and escaped again in this disguise. In Cholet he found a job as cattle drover and while travelling through the country in this capacity he passed through Paris, Arras, Brussels, Ancer and finally Rotterdam, where he was shanghaied by the Dutch. After a short career as privateer he was arrested again and brought to Douai where he was identified as Vidocq. He was transferred to the bagne in Toulon, where he arrived on 29 August 1799. After one failed escape attempt, he finally escaped again on 6 March 1800 with the help of a prostitute.\\n\\nVidocq returned to Arras in hiding. The year was 1800. His father had died in 1799, so he found accommodation at his mother's home. There he hid for almost half a year, before he was recognized and had to flee again. He assumed an identity as an Austrian and spent some time in a relationship with a widow, with whom he also moved to Rouen in 1802. Vidocq built up for himself a reputation as businessman and finally felt secure enough to let his mother come live with him and the widow. But finally his past caught up with him. He was arrested and brought to Louvres. There he learned that he had been sentenced to death in absentia. With the help of the local Procurator-General Ransom he filed an appeal and spent the following five months in prison waiting for a re-trial. During this time Louise Chevalier contacted him to inform him about their divorce. When it seemed that there would be no decision concerning his sentence he decided to flee again. On 28 November 1805 while being unattended for a moment he jumped out of a window into the adjacent river Scarpe. The next four years he once again was a man on the run.\\n\\nHe spent some time in Paris, where he witnessed the execution of César Herbaux, the man with whom his life had started to spiral downwards. This event triggered a process of reconsideration in Vidocq. With his mother and a woman he called Annette in his memoirs, he moved several times in the following years. But again and again people from his past recognized him. He had again tried to become a legitimate merchant, but his former wife had found him in Paris and blackmailed him for money and a couple of former fellow convicts forced him to fence for them.\\n\\nthumbOn 1 July 1809, only a few days before his 34th birthday, Vidcoq was arrested again. He decided to stop living on the fringes of society and offered his service as an informant to the police. His offer was accepted and on 20 July he was jailed in Bicêtre where he started his work as a spy. On 28 October he continued his work in La Force Prison. He sounded out his inmates and forwarded his information about forged identities and unsolved crimes through Annette to the police chief of Paris Jean Henry.\\n\\nAfter 21 months of spying Vidocq was released from jail on the recommendation of Henry. So as not to raise suspicions among the other inmates, the release (which took place on 25 March 1811) was arranged to look like an escape. Still, Vidocq was not really free, because now he was obliged to Henry. Therefore, he continued to work as a secret agent for the Paris police. He used his contacts and his reputation in the criminal underworld to gain trust. He disguised himself as an escaped convict and immersed himself in the criminal scene to learn about planned and committed crimes. He even took part in felonies in order to suddenly turn on his partners and arrest them. When criminals eventually began to suspect him, he used disguises and assumed other identities to continue his work and throw off suspicion.\\n\\nAt the end of 1811 Vidocq informally organized a plainclothes unit, the Brigade de la Sûreté (\"Security Brigade\"). The police department recognized the value of the civil agents, and in October 1812 the experiment was officially converted to a security police unit under the umbrella of the Prefecture of Police. Vidocq was appointed its leader. On 17 December 1813 Napoleon Bonaparte signed a decree, which made the brigade a state security police force. From this day on it was called Sûreté Nationale.\\n\\nThe Sûreté initially had eight, then twelve, and in 1823 had twenty employees. One year later it increased again to 28 secret agents. In addition, there were eight persons who secretly worked for the Sûreté but instead of a salary they received licences for gambling halls. A major part of Vidocq's subordinates were ex-criminals like himself. He even hired them fresh from the prisons, e.g. Coco Lacour, who would later be Vidocq's successor at the Sûreté. Vidocq described his work from this period:\\n\\n \\n\\nVidocq personally trained his agents, for example in selecting the correct disguise depending on the kind of job. He himself still went out hunting for criminals too. His memoirs are full with stories about how he outsmarted criminals by pretending to be a beggar or an old cuckold. At one point he even simulated his own death.\\n\\nDuring 1814, at the beginning of the French Restoration, Vidocq and the Sûreté tried to contain the situation in Paris. He also arrested those who tried to exploit the post-revolutionary situation by claiming to have been aristocrat. During 1817, he was involved with 811 arrests, including those of 15 assassin and 38 fence. By 1820 his activities had decreased the crime of Paris substantially. His annual income was 5,000 francs, but he also worked as a private investigator for fees. Rumors at the time claimed that Vidocq set criminals up, organizing break-ins and robberies and having his agents wait to collect the offenders. Even though some of Vidocq's techniques might have been questionable, there seems to have been no truth to this.\\n\\nDespite his position as chief of a police authority, Vidocq remained a wanted criminal. His conviction for document forgery had never been fully dismounted and so alongside complaints and denunciations his superiors repeatedly received requests from the prison director of Douai, which were ignored. Finally the Comte Jules Anglès, prefect of the Paris police, reacted to a petition by Vidocq and initiated the official pardon, which he received on 26 March 1817 by king Louis XVIII. \\n\\nthumbIn November 1820 Vidocq married again, this time the destitute Jeanne-Victoire Guérin, whose origin is unknown, which at that time led to speculation. She came to live in the household at 111 Rue de l'Hirondelle, where Vidocq's mother and a niece of hers, the 27-year-old Fleuride Albertine Maniez (* March 22, 1793), also lived. In 1822 Vidocq befriended the author Honoré de Balzac who began to use him as a model for several figures in his books. Vidocq's wife, who was ailing throughout their marriage, died after four years, in June 1824 in a hospital. Six weeks later, on 30 July 1824, Vidocq's mother died at age 83. She was buried with honours and her requiem was performed in Notre Dame Cathedral.\\n\\nEvents of the 1820s had an impact on the police apparatus. After the assassination of the Duc de Berry in February 1820, police prefect Anglès had to resign and was replaced by the Jesuit Guy Delavau who set a high value on religiosity among his subordinates. In 1824 Louis XVIII died. His successor was the ultra-reactionary Charles X, who reigned repressively and for this purpose regularly withdrew police agents from their original activities. Finally Vidocq's immediate superior, the police chief Henry, retired and was succeeded by Parisot who quickly was superseded by the ambitious but also very formal Marc Duplessis. The antipathy between Vidocq and Duplessis was great. Time and time again Duplessis complained about trivial matters, for example, that Vidocq's agents spent time in brothels and bars of ill repute. Vidocq's reasoning that they had to do this to establish contacts and gather information was ignored. When Vidocq received two official warnings within a short time, he had enough. On 20 June 1827, the 52-year-old handed in his resignation:\\n\\nHe then wrote his memoirs with the help of a ghost-writer.\\n\\nthumbVidocq, who was a rich man after his resignation, became an entrepreneur. In Saint-Mandé, a small town east of Paris, where he also married his cousin Fleuride Maniez on 28 January 1830, he founded a paper factory. He mainly employed released convicts - both men and women. This caused an outrageous scandal in society and led to disputes. In addition, the machines cost money, the semi-skilled workers needed food and clothing, and the customers refused to pay marked prices with the argument that he had a seemingly cheaper workforce. The company did not last long - Vidocq went bankrupt in 1831. But in the short time while he was away from Paris, both Delavau and Duplessis had to resign their posts and Charles X had to abdicate during the July Revolution in 1830. When Vidocq delivered a few useful tips which helped to solve a burglary, the new Police Prefect Henri Gisquet appointed him again chef of the Sûreté.\\n\\nThe criticism of Vidocq and his organization grew. The July Monarchy caused insecurities in society, and there was a cholera outbreak in 1832. One of its victims was General Jean Maximilien Lamarque. During his funeral on 5 June 1832 a revolt erupted and the throne of \"Citizen King\" Louis-Philippe I was in danger. Allegedly Vidocq's group cracked down on the rioters with great severity. Not all the police approved of his methods, and rivalries developed. A rumour came up that Vidocq had initiated the theft that led to his reinstatement himself to show his indispensability. One of his agents had to go to prison for two years because of that affair, but Vidocq's involvement could not be proved. Finally the problems for his agency culminated, when more and more defenders claimed that Vidocq and his agents were not credible as eye witnesses since most of them had a criminal past themselves. Vidocq's position was untenable for good and on 15 November 1832 he once again resigned using the pretext of his wife being ill.\\n\\nOn the same day, the Sûreté was dissolved and re-established. Agents with criminal records were no longer allowed. Vidocq's successor was Pierre Allard.\\n\\nIn 1833, Vidocq founded Le bureau des renseignements (engl. Office of Information), a company that was as a mixture between detective agency and private police. It is considered as the first known detective agency. Once again he predominantly hired ex-con.\\n\\nHis squad, which initially consisted of eleven detectives, two clerks and one secretary, pitted itself on behalf of businesspeople and private citizends against Faiseurs (crooks, fraudsters, bankruptcy artists), occasionally using illegal means too. As from 1837 Vidocq was in constant quarrels with the official police because of his activities and his diffuse relations with various government agencies such as the War Department. On 28 November 1837 the police executed a search and seizure and confiscated over 3,500 files and documents. A few days later Vidocq was arrested and spent Christmas and New Year in jail. He was charged with three crimes, namely the acquisition of money by deception, the corruption of civil servants, and the pretension of public functions. In February 1838 after numerous witnesses testified the judge dismissed all three charges. Vidocq was free again.\\n\\nVidocq's person increasingly became the subject of literature and public discussions. Balzac wrote several novels and plays which contained characters modeled after Vidocq.\\n\\nthumbThe agency flourished, but Vidocq continued to make enemies, some of them powerful. On 17 August 1842, on behalf of police prefect Gabriel Delessert 75 police officers stormed his office building and arrested him and one of his agents. This time the case seemed to be clear. In an investigation for defalcation he had made an illegal arrest and had demanded a bill of exchange for the embezzled money from the arrested fraudster. For the next few months, 67 years old, Vidocq was remanded in custody in the Conciergerie. On 3 May 1843 the first hearings finally took place before judge Michel Barbou, a close friend of Delessert. During the trial Vidocq had to give account for many other cases, among them the kidnapping of several women which allegedly he had delivered to monasteries against their will at the behest of their families. Also his activities as money lender and possible benefits from it were examined. Finally he was sentenced to five years imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 franc. Vidocq immediately appealed and through the intervention of political friends like the count Gabriel de Berny and the attorney general Franck-Carré he quickly got a new trial, this time with the chief judge of court royale. The hearing on 22 July 1843 was a matter of minutes, and after eleven months in the Conciergerie Vidocq once again was a free man.\\n\\nThe harm was done. The lawsuit had been very expensive, and his reputation was damaged. Business at the agency suffered. Moreover, Delessert tried to get him expelled from the city for being a former criminal. Although the attempt failed, Vidocq increasingly considered selling his agency. But he could not find a qualified and reputable buyer.\\n\\nIn the following years Vidocq published several small books in which he depicted his life in direct confrontation with the rumours about him which were afloat. In 1844 he presented an essay on prisons, penitentiaries, and the death penalty. On the morning of 22 September 1847 his third wife Fleuride died after 17 years of marriage. Vidocq did not marry again, but until his death he had several intimate partners.\\n\\nIn 1848 the February revolution caused the abdication of \"Citizen King\" Louis-Philippe. The Second Republic with Alphonse de Lamartine as the head of a transitional government was proclaimed. And although Vidocq always had been proud of his receptions at the kings court and had boasted with his access to Louis-Philippe, he offered his services to the new government. His task was the surveillance of political opponents such as Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, the nephew of Napoleon I. Meanwhile, the new government sank into chaos and violence. At the presidential elections scheduled for 10 December 1848 Lamartine received less than 8,000 votes. Vidocq presented himself as a candidate in the 2nd Arrondissement, but received only one vote. The clear winner and thus president of the Second Republic was Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte who did not react to Vidocq's offer to work for him.\\n\\nIn 1849 Vidocq briefly had to go to prison one last time, on a charge of fraud. In the end, however, the case was dropped. He withdrew more and more into private life and accepted only small cases every now and then. In the last years of his life, he suffered a massive pain in his right arm which had been broken in the past and had never healed properly. Also, unwise investments had cost him a large portion of his assets, so he had to curb his living standard and live in rented accommodations. In August 1854, despite contrary prognosis by his doctor, he survived the cholera. Only in April 1857 his condition deteriorated so that he could no longer stand up. On 11 May 1857 Vidocq died at the age of 82 years in his home in Paris in the presence of his doctor, his lawyer and a priest.\\n\\nthumbHis body was brought the church Saint-Denys du Saint-Sacrement, where the funeral service was held. It is not known where Vidocq is buried, wherefore some rumours about it exist. One of them for example which is mentioned in the biography of John Philip Stead claims that his grave is located at the cemetery in Saint Mandé. There is a gravestone with the inscription \"Vidocq 18\". According to information from city officials however, this grave is registered to Vidocq's last wife Fleuride-Albertine Maniez.\\n\\nIn the end, his assets consisted of 2,907.50 francs from the sale of his goods and a pension of 867.50 francs. A total of eleven women came forward as owners of his testament, a document which they had received for their favour instead of presents. His remaining assets went to Anne-Heloïse Lefèvre, at whose house he had lived at the end. Vidocq had no children, at least none that would be known. Recognition attempts by Emile-Adolphe Vidocq, the son of his first wife, who for these purposes changed his last name, failed. Vidocq had left evidence which excluded his paternity. At the time of conception he had been in prison.\\n\\nVidocq is considered by historians as the \"father\" of modern criminology. His approaches were new and unique for that time. He is credited with the introduction of undercover work, ballistics, criminology and a record-keeping-system to criminal investigation. He made the first plaster cast of shoe impressions. He created indelible ink and unalterable bond paper with his printing company. His form of anthropometrics is still partially used by French police. He is also credited for philanthropic pursuits – he claimed he never informed on anyone who had stolen for real need. At the same time his work was not acknowledged in France for a long time because of his criminal past. In September 1905 the Sûreté Nationale exhibited a painting series with its former heads. However, the first painting of the series showed Pierre Allard, Vidocq's successor. The newspaper L’Exclusive reported on 17 September 1905 that on obtaining information concerning the omission they had gotten the answer that Vidocq never had been head of the Sûreté.\\n\\nWhen Vidocq crossed to the police around 1810, there were two police organizations in France: on the one side the police politique, an intelligence agency, whose agents were dealing with the detection of conspiracies and intrigues; on the other side the normal police, who investigated in the common crimes like theft, fraud, prostitution, and murder. Since the Middle Ages those constables wore identification insignia which over time had developed to full uniforms. Unlike the often covertly operating political police, they were easy to spot. For fear of attacks they did not dare to enter some Parisian districts, their possibilities in crime prevention were correspondingly limited.\\n\\nVidocq persuaded his superiors to allow his agents, who also included women, the utilization of plain clothes and disguises depending on the situation. Thus they did not attract attention and as former criminals also knew the hiding places and methods of criminals. Through their contacts they often learned about planned crimes and were able to catch the guilty red-handed. Vidocq also had a different approach on interrogations. In his memoirs he mentions several times that he didn't take the arrested to prison immediately, but invited them to dinner where he had a chat with them. In addition to information about other crimes he often obtained confessions the non-violent way and recruited future informants and even agents.\\n\\nAugust Vollmer, the first police chief of Berkeley, California and a leading personality in the development of criminal justice in the United States engaged himself into the works of Vidocq and the Austrian criminal jurist Hans Gross for his reform of the Berkeley police force. His reform ideas were adopted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and as a result also affected J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI. After Robert Peel had established Scotland Yard in 1829, he sent a committee to Paris in 1832 which conferred with Vidocq for several days. In 1843 again two commissars of Scotland Yard traveled to Paris for further training. They spent only two days with Pierre Allard, who was head of the Sûreté by then. Then they went to Vidocq and for one week accompanied him and his agents in their work.\\n\\nthumbJürgen Thorwald stated in his book Das Jahrhundert der Detektive (1964) that Vidocq had a photographic memory which allowed him to recognize previously convicted criminals, even in disguise. Biographer Samuel Edwards reported in The Vidocq Dossier about a trial against the fraudster and forger Lambert, in which Vidocq referred to his memory of the accused. Vidocq regularly visited the prisons to memorise the faces of the inmates, and made his agents visit prisons for the same purpose. The English police adopted this method. Until the late 1980s, British investigators attended court hearings to observe the spectators in the public galleries and become aware of possible accomplices.\\n\\nAs Vidocq said at Lambert's trial while his memory was phenomenal, he could not require the same of his agents. Therefore for each arrested person he carefully set up an index card with a personal description, aliases, previous convictions, modus operandi, and other information. The card of forger Lambert contained among other things a handwriting sample. The index card system had been retained not only by the French police but also employed by police units in other countries. However, it soon revealed its weaknesses. By the time Alphonse Bertillon came to the Sûreté as clerk in 1879, the descriptions on the cards were not detailed enough anymore to really identify suspects based on them. This caused Bertillon to develop a anthropometric system for personal identification called the bertillonage. The sorting of the card boxes, which by then already filled several rooms, was converted to body dimensions, the first of many attempts to improve the structure of the sorting. With the advent of information age the cards were digitised and the card boxes were replaced by database. Among them are several databases which are managed by the FBI, e.g. the IAFIS, a biometric database, the MUPS, a database containing data on missing person and unidentified bodies, and the NIBRS, which documents criminal incidents.\\n\\nForensic science did not yet exist during Vidocq's time. Despite numerous scientific papers, the police had not recognized its practical benefits, and this could not be changed by Vidocq. Nevertheless, he was not so adverse to experiments as his superiors and usually had a small laboratory set up in the office buildings. In the archives of the Parisian police are reports of cases which he solved by applying forensic methods decades before they were recognized as such.\\n\\nIn 1990 in Philadelphia the Vidocq Society was founded. Its members are forensic experts, FBI profilers, homicide investigators, scientists, psychologists and coroner who in monthly meetings try to solve cold cases from around the world free of charge and in compliance to their motto Veritas veritatum (eng. Truth generates truth).\\n\\nthumbAround 1827 Vidocq wrote a biography about his life thus far, which he planned to publish in summer 1828 at the bookseller Emile Morice. But the friendly authors Honoré de Balzac, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas were of the opinion that the story was too short, so Vidocq looked for a new publisher which he found in Louis François L'Héritier. In December of the same year L'Héritier published the memoirs which had increased to four volumes through the help of some ghostwriter. The work became a bestseller and sold over 50,000 times in the first year according to biographer Samuel Edwards. The success inspired imitators. In 1829 two journalists under the pseudonym of a criminal named Malgaret published the book Mémoires d’un forçat ou Vidocq dévoilé which should expose criminal activities Vidocq allegedly had committed. Also other police officers followed Vidocq's example and published their own biographies in the following years, among them the prefect of police Henri Gisquet.\\n\\nVidocq's life story inspired many contemporary writers, many of them belonged to his closest friends. In Balzac's writings he regularly was the model of literary figures: in the third part of Illusions perdues – Les Souffrances de l'inventeur – his experiences as failed entrepreneur were seized, in Gobseck Balzac introduces the policemen Corentin, but most clearly the connection to Vidocq can be found in the figure Vautrin. This character first appears in the novel Le Père Goriot, then in Illusions perdues, Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes (as main character), La Cousine Bette, Le Contrat de mariage and finally is the main character in theatre play Vautrin from 1840. Not only Vidocq as a person but also his methods and disguises inspired Balzac in his work.\\n\\nIn Victor Hugo's Les Misérables (1862) both main characters, the reformed criminal Jean Valjean and his pursuer, police inspector Javert, were modelled after Vidocq; same for the policemen Monsieur Jackal in Les Mohicans de Paris (1854–1855) from Alexandre Dumas. He also was the basis for Rodolphe de Gerolstein who provided justice in the serial newspaper novel The Mysteries of Paris of Eugène Sue in the weekly newspaper Journal des débats. And he was the inspiration of Émile Gaboriau for Monsieur Lecoq, one of the first scientific and methodical investigators who played the lead role in many adventures, who in turn then was a major influence for the creation of Sherlock Holmes. It is also believed that Edgar Allan Poe was prompted by a story about Vidocq to create the first detective in fiction, C. Auguste Dupin, who appeared for example in the short story The Murders in the Rue Morgue which is considered the first detective story. Vidocq is also mentioned in Moby Dick of Herman Melville and Great Expectations of Charles Dickens.\\n\\nIn James Joyce's story Araby the protagonist - an adolescent boy in Dublin at the turn of the 20th Century - finds among old papers a yellowed copy of \"The Memoirs of Vidocq\".\\n\\nthumbVidocq was – probably obvious considering his penchant for disguises – a friend of the theater. During his lifetime the ''Boulevard du Crime'' was quite popular, a road with several theatres which regularly presented crime stories in form of melodramas. One of this theatres was the Théâtre de l'Ambigu-Comique, which was sponsored by Vidocq \\tto a great extent. According to the biographer James Morton Vidocq also submitted a play, but it never was produced. He also had plans to dabble in play-acting but never carried them out.\\n\\nNot only many of Vidocq's paramours were actresses, but a lot of his friends and acquaintances too were from the theatre scene. Among them was the famous actor Frédérick Lemaître who inter alia played the main role in Balzac's Vautrin, a play which debuted on 14 March 1840 at Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin after numerous problems with the censorship. Lemaître tried to adapt his appearance to that of Vidocq on whom the character Vautrin was based. At the premiere there were commotions because the wig Lemaître had used was also similar to the one of King Louis-Philippe. The play was banned by the French interior minister after that and not performed again.\\n\\nBut not only plays inspired by Vidocq were shown in theatre, his one life story also made it on stage several times, usually with his memoirs as literary template. Especially in England the enthusiasm was great for Vidocq. The memoirs had been rapidly translated into English and a few month later on 6 July 1829 the premiere of Vidocq! The French Police Spy was taking place in Surrey Theatre in the London Borough of Lambeth. The melodrama in 2 acts, produced by Robert William Elliston, was penned by Douglas William Jerrold, the main character was played by TP Cooke. Although the critics, among them one from The Times, were quite positive, the play was performed only nine times in the first month and then dropped.\\n\\nIn December 1860, some years after Vidocq's death, another play about him, written by F. Marchant, was presented in Britannia Theatre in Hoxton under the title Vidocq or The French Jonathan Wild. It was included in the theatre program for only one week.\\n\\nIn 1909 Émile Bergerat wrote the melodrama Vidocq, empereur des policiers in five acts and seven scenes. The producers Hertz and Coquelin rejected it but Bergerat sued them successfully for 8,000 francs damages. The play debuted in 1910 in Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt. Jean Kemm, who years later would also participate in a movie about Vidocq, took over the lead role.\\n\\nThe first film about Vidocq was made back in 1909. Based on his memoirs on 13 August 1909 the short black and white silent film La Jeunesse de Vidocq ou Comment on devient policier was published in France. Vidocq was played by Harry Baur who also portrayed him in the two sequels L'Évasion de Vidocq (1910) and Vidocq (1911)\\n\\nUnder the direction of Jean Kemm the next silent movie Vidocq was created in 1922. The screenplay was written by Arthur Bernède based again on Vidocq's memoirs. The main role was played by René Navarre.\\n\\nThe first sound film, albeit still in black and white, was published in 1938. Jacques Daroy shot the film which once again was named after the main character Vidocq with actor André Brulé. The film mostly displayed Vidocq's criminal career. Compared to other contemporary crime films it was rather unglamorous but still was played in some movie theatres outside of France.\\n\\nOn 19 July 1946 the first film about Vidocq made by Americans appeared – A Scandal in Paris, still in black and white. George Sanders portrayed Vidocq in the highly fictionalized biopic by Douglas Sirk, which showed the rise of a rogue in society coupled with a love story. Already in April 1948 it was followed by the next French version of Vidocq's life story. Le Cavalier de Croix-Mort was shot by Lucien Ganier-Raymond with Henri Nassiet in the leading role.\\n\\nOn 7 January 1967 the French television station ORTF showed the first of two television series, each with 13 episodes. Vidocq with Bernard Noël was still in black and white. This changed only with the second series Les Nouvelles Aventures de Vidocq which premiered on 5 January 1971. Claude Brasseur was the first to display Vidocq in colour. \\n\\nFinally in 2001 Gérard Depardieu under the direction of Pitof depicted Vidocq in a science fiction film, once again named Vidocq.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Europop", "body": "Europop refers to a style of pop music that first developed in today's form in Europe, throughout the late 1970s. Europop topped the charts throughout the 1980s and ’90s. Some Europop stars came from France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands and United Kingdom; but most were Swedish in origin. In the 1970s, such groups were primarily popular in continental countries, with the exception of the biggest Europop outfit ever, Swedish 4-piece ABBA, who achieved great success in the UK, where they scored a 19 top 10 singles and 9 chart-topping albums, and in North America and Australia. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Roxette and Ace of Base led Europop in American and British mainstream audiences. In the 1990s, pop groups like the Spice Girls, Aqua, Backstreet Boys and singer DJ BoBo were strongly influenced by Europop. In the 2000s, one of the most popular representators of Europop music is Swedish pop group Alcazar. One of the main differences between American and European pop is that Europop is generally more dance and trance oriented. In central Europe Italo disco (a.k.a. ’80s Eurodisco) and Euro house (a.k.a. ’90s Eurodance) (later) are the predominant attempts by young musicians to have a hit record in and beyond the borders of their own country.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eurovision Song Contest 1995", "body": "The Eurovision Song Contest 1995 was the 40th Eurovision Song Contest and was held on 13 May 1995 in the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. The presenter was Mary Kennedy. This contest broke the chain of victories that Ireland enjoyed in 1992, 1993, and 1994. This was Ireland's 3rd year in succession to host the contest - and to mark the 40th show, it was opened with a 4-minute retrospective showing images from the contest's history. The Norwegian group Secret Garden was the winner of this contest with the mostly instrumental song, \"Nocturne\". Incidentally, Secret Garden's violinist was Fionnuala Sherry, who is Irish.\\n\\nTwo of Ireland's winners attended the contest; Dana, who was Ireland's first winner, winning the contest in 1970 with \"All Kinds of Everything\", and Mr Eurovision himself, Johnny Logan, winning the contest as a singer in 1980 and 1987 (\"What's Another Year?\" and \"Hold me Now\" respectively), and also for writing Linda Martin's 1992 winning song \"Why Me?\". It was his birthday that night, but according to host Kennedy, \"He wouldn't say which one\"! Nonetheless, the audience sang \"Happy Birthday\" for him, assisted by the orchestra.\\n\\nAfter winning the 1994 contest, RTÉ were worried about whether they could afford to host a third consecutive contest in 1995. The BBC had offered to take on the responsibility of hosting the contest, and had even proposed that the contest be staged as a joint production in Belfast, capital of Northern Ireland. In the end RTÉ decided to stage the contest on its own. However they did ask the EBU that, should Ireland win once more, that they would not be expected to host the event for a fourth year in a row.\\n\\nThe favourite to win the contest, according to bookmakers, was Sweden with the pop-ballad \"Se på mej\". Other countries in contention for the win were Denmark, Israel, Slovenia, and the eventual winner, Norway. The winning song was something new at Eurovision in that it contained only 24 words accompanied by long violin solos. The United Kingdom contributed a modern rap number, while the previous year’s runner-up, Poland, went for something that completely contrasted with their début entry. \\n\\nAfter the first two juries voted, Norway and Sweden both shared first place. Denmark and Spain trailed the two countries, but after the voting was completed, Norway was the winner with 148 points, followed by Spain's \"Vuelve Conmigo\" with 119 points, and Sweden gaining 100 points.\\n\\nThe stage was designed by Alan Farquharson who also designed the Millstreet 93 set. Although it was quite dark and often gloomy in appearance, it did form the basis for a spectacular opening whereby a giant screen rotated to reveal the presenter who descended a stairway which ultimately disappeared to allow for the arrow shaped stage to come together amid fireworks. The interval act consisted of several well known Irish performers including Clannad, Brian Kennedy (who would go on to actually represent Ireland 11 years later), and was composed by leading musician Michael O'Suilleabhan.\\n\\nThe EBU decreased the number of participants back to 23 to make sure the show wouldn't last longer than 3 hours. 5 of the 6 countries that were relegated the previous year came back to the contest, Luxembourg decided to stop participating completely and Italy withdrew voluntarily, as in 1994. \\n\\nThere was much speculation in Ireland as to whether RTÉ had deliberately chosen a song perceived as not having a good chance of winning in order to avoid hosting the contest for a fourth time in a row - although this was never verified. This rumour did, however inspire a popular episode of Father Ted. In any event, RTÉ ended up hosting the contest once again in 1997.\\n\\nEach country had a jury that awarded 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 points for their top ten songs.\\n\\nBelow is a summary of all 12 points in the final:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eurovision Song Contest 2006", "body": "The Eurovision Song Contest 2006 was the 51st Eurovision Song Contest, held at the Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens, Greece on 18 May (for the semi-final) and 20 May 2006 (for the final). The hosting national broadcaster of the contest was Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi (ERT). The Finnish band Lordi won the contest with the song \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\" with 292 points. (However this record was broken with Norway's win with 387 points in 2009). \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\" was the first ever hard rock song to win the contest, since Eurovision is normally associated with softer pop music and schlager. This was Finland's first victory in Eurovision after 45 years of participation. \\n\\nThe hosts of the Eurovision Song Contest in Athens were popular Greek singer Sakis Rouvas, the Greek representative at Eurovision in 2004 and 2009, and the Greek American television presenter and actress, Maria Menounos. In the semi-final, both the hosts sang Katrina and the Waves' contest-winning \"Love Shine A Light\". For one of the intervals, Sakis Rouvas sang an English version of his Greek hit \"S'eho Erotefthi\" called \"I'm in love with you\". Elena Paparizou, who performed the winning song in Kiev, returned to the Eurovision stage in Athens. Following the examples of Sertab Erener and Ruslana in the last two years, she sang twice in the final, \"My Number One\" in the opening and \"Mambo!\" in the interval; Greek dancers were also present in the interval acts, as well as other Greek elements. An official CD and DVD was released and a new introduction was an official fan book released from this year, and every year to come with detailed information of every country.\\n\\nThe 2006 contest also saw the 1,000th song to be performed in the contest, when \"Every Song Is a Cry for Love\" by Ireland's Brian Kennedy was first sung in the semi-final. Armenia also entered for the first time in the contest.\\n\\nThe official logo of the contest remained the same from 2004 and 2005 with the country's flag in the heart being changed. The 2006 sub-logo created by the design company Karamela for Greek television was apparently based on the Phaistos Disc which is a popular symbol of ancient Greece. According to ERT, it was \"inspired by the wind and the sea, the golden sunlight and the glow of the sand\". Following Istanbul's \"Under The Same Sky\" and Kiev's \"Awakening\", the slogan for the 2006 show was \"Feel The Rhythm\". This theme was also the basis for the postcards for the 2006 show, which emphasized Greece's historical significance as well as being a major modern tourist destination.\\n\\nTo save time in the final, the voting time lasted ten minutes and the voting process was changed: points 1-7 were shown immediately on-screen. The spokespersons only announced the countries scoring 8, 10 and 12 points. Despite this being intended to speed proceedings up, there were still problems during voting - EBU imaging over-rode Maria Menounos during a segment in the voting interval and some scoreboards were slow to load. The Netherlands' spokesperson Paul de Leeuw also caused problems, giving his mobile number to presenter Rouvas during the Dutch results, and slowing down proceedings, also by announcing the first seven points. Constantinos Christoforou (who also represented Cyprus in 1996, 2002 and 2005) saluted from \"Nicosia, the last divided capital in Europe\"; during Cyprus' reading, the telecast displayed Switzerland by mistake. Also, since Christoforou took time to read out the 12 points in order to create some suspense, the points were already added to Greece in order to proceed with the voting. This voting process has been criticized because suspense was lost by only reading three votes instead of ten. And for the first time, the display for the Macedonian entry had the title spelled out in its entirety (as \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\") instead of being abbreviated as it has been in previous years (as \"FYR Macedonia\").\\n\\nParticipating countries in a Eurovision Song Contest must be active members of the EBU.\\n\\nThe semi-final was held on 18 May 2006 at 21:00 (CET). 23 countries performed and all 37 participants and Serbia & Montenegro voted.\\n\\nShaded countries qualified for the Eurovision Final\\n\\nThe finalists were:\\n\\nThe final was held on 20 May 2006 at 21:00 (CET) and was won by Finland.\\n\\nCountries in bold automatically qualified for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 Final.\\n\\nCountries revealed their votes in the following order:\\n\\n<ol start=\"14\"><li><li><li><li><li><li><li><li> <li> <li><li> <li><li><ol start=\"27\"><li><li><li> <li><li><li><li><li><li><li><li><li>\\n\\nTelevoting was used in all nations except Monaco and Albania. Monaco used a jury as the chances of getting enough votes needed to validify the votes were low. Albania used a jury since there were problems with their televote. In the semi final, Andorra joined Monaco and Albania in using the jury due to insufficient televoting numbers.\\n\\nBelow is a summary of all 12 points in the final:\\n\\nSerbia and Montenegro withdrew from the contest due to a scandal in the selection process, which has caused tensions between the Serbian broadcaster, RTS, and the Montenegran broadcaster, RTCG. Serbia and Montenegro did retain voting rights for the contest.\\n\\nSerbia and Montenegro's withdrawal left a vacancy in the final. In the delegations meeting on March 20, it was decided that Croatia, who finished 11th in the 2005 Contest, would fill the empty spot.\\n\\nAfter the Contest, EBU officials that the overall ratings for the Semi-Final were 35% higher than in 2005, and for the Final had risen by 28%.\\n\\nIn France, average market shares reached 30.3%, up by 8% over the 2005 figure.

{"title": "Eurybiades", "body": "Eurybiades () was the Sparta commander in charge of the Greek navy during the Persian Wars.\\n\\nHe was the son of Eurycleides, and was chosen as commander in 480 BC because the Peloponnesian city-states lead by Sparta, worried about the growing power of Athens, did not want to serve under an Athenian, despite the Athenians' superior naval skill. Despite the enmity between the two, Eurybiades was assisted by the Athenian naval commander Themistocles.\\n\\nHis first act as commander was to sail the fleet to Euboea to meet the Persian fleet. When they arrived the Greeks found that the Persians were already there, and Eurybiades ordered a retreat, although the Euboeans begged him to stay. Instead, they bribed Themistocles to keep the fleet there, and Themistocles used some of his bribe to pay off Eurybiades (at least according to Herodotus). The subsequent Battle of Artemisium was indecisive, and the Greeks removed their fleet to Salamis Island.\\n\\nInitially at Salamis, Eurybiades wanted to move the fleet to the Isthmus of Corinth, where the armies of the Hellenic League were building fortifications. Themistocles, the better naval tactition, saw the benefits of fighting at Salamis and wanted to force a naval battle there. Eurybiades was insistent, and Themistocles had to threaten to withdraw the Athenian fleet (the largest contingent of the Greek forces) in order to make Eurybiades stay. After Themistocles tricked Xerxes into separating his fleet by sending part around the island to blockade the Greek fleet in the Straits of Salamis, Eurybiades was forced to accept Salamis as the battlefield. The Battle of Salamis was a decisive victory for the Greeks. After the battle Eurybiades was opposed to chasing the Persian fleet, and also to sailing towards the Hellespont to destroy the bridge of ships that the Persian king Xerxes I had built there. He wanted Xerxes to be able to escape rather than have him remain in Greece where he would possibly renew the land war.\\n\\nBack in Sparta Eurybiades was rewarded with an olive wreath for his success at Salamis; Themistocles was given a similar reward.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eusebius of Nicomedia", "body": "Eusebius of Nicomedia (died 341) was the man who baptised Constantine. He was a bishop of Berytus (modern-day Beirut) in Phoenicia, then of Nicomedia where the imperial court resided in Bithynia, and finally of Constantinople from 338 up to his death.\\n\\nDistantly related to the imperial family of Constantine, he not only owed his removal from an insignificant to the most important episcopal see to his influence at court, but the great power he wielded in the Church was derived from that source. In fact, during his time in the Imperial court, the Eastern court and the major positions in the Eastern Church were held by Arians or Arian sympathizers. With the exception of a short period of eclipse, he enjoyed the complete confidence both of Constantine and Constantius II and was the tutor of the later Emperor Julian the Apostate; and it was he who baptized Constantine the Great on May 22, 337. Also during his time in the Imperial court, Arianism became more popular with the Royal family. It can be logically surmised that Eusebius had a huge hand in the acceptance of Arianism in the Constantinian household. The Arian influence grew so strong during his tenure in the Imperial court that it wasn't until the end of the Constantinian dynasty and the appointment of Theodosius I that Arianism lost its influence in the Empire. \\n\\nIt was of particular interest that Eusebius was nearly persecuted because of his close relationship to the Emperor Licinius while serving as Bishop of Nicomedia during Licinius' reign.\\n\\nLike Arius, he was a pupil of Lucian of Antioch, and it is probable that he held the same views as Arius from the very beginning; he was also one of Arius' most fervent supporters who encouraged Arius. It was also because of this relationship that he was the first person whom Arius contacted after the latter was excommunicated from Alexandria by Alexander. Apparently, Arius and Eusebius were close enough and Eusebius powerful enough that Arius was able to put his theology down in writing. He afterward modified his ideas somewhat, or perhaps he only yielded to the pressure of circumstances; but he was, if not the teacher, at all events the leader and organizer, of the Arian party.\\n\\nAt the First Council of Nicaea, 325, he signed the Confession, but only after a long and desperate opposition in which he \"subscribe with hand only, not heart\" according to ancient sources. It was a huge blow to the Arian party since it was surmised that the participants in the First Council of Nicaea were evenly split between non-Arians and Arians.His defense of Arius angered the emperor, and a few months after the councilhe was sent into exile due to his continual contacts with Arius and the exiles. After the lapse of three years, he succeeded in regaining the imperial favor by convincing Constantine that Arius and his views do not conflict with the Nicene Creed. After his return in 329 he brought the whole machinery of the state government into action in order to impose his views upon the Church.\\n\\nEusebius was more of a politician than anything else, and a skilled one. Upon his return, he regained the lost ground resulted from the First Council of Nicaea, established alliances with other groups such as the Meletians and expelled many opponents.\\n\\nHe was described by modern historians as an \"ambitious intriguer\"  and a \"consummate political player\". He was also described by ancient sources as a high-handed person who was also aggressive in his dealings.; he also used his allies to spy on his opponents.\\n\\nHe was able to dislodge and exile three key Arian opponents who espoused the First Council of Nicaea: Eustathius of Antioch in 330, Athanasius of Alexandria in 335 and Marcellus of Ancyra in 336. This was no small feat since Athanasius was regarded as a \"man of God\" by Constantine. and both Eustathius and Athanasius held top positions in the church.\\n\\nAnother major feat was his appointment as the Patriarch of Constantinople by expelling Paul I of Constantinople; Paul would eventually return as Patriarch after Eusebius' death. \\n\\nEven outside the empire, Eusebius had great influence. He brought Ulfilas into the Arian priesthood and sent the latter to convert the heathen Goths. \\n\\nEusebius baptised Constantine the Great in his villa in Nicomedia, on May 22, 337 just before the death of the Emperor.\\n\\nHe died at the height of his power in the year 342.\\n\\nHe was so influential that even after his death, Constantius II heeded his and Eudoxus of Constantinople's advice to attempt to convert the Roman Empire to Arianism by creating Arian Councils and official Arian Doctrines.\\n\\nIt was because of Eusebius that \"On the whole, Constantine and his successors made life pretty miserable for Church leaders committed to the Nicene decision and its Trinitarian formula.\"\\n\\nEusebius of Nicomedia is not to be confused with his contemporary Eusebius of Caesarea, the author of a well-known early book of Church History.\\n\\nCorrespondence of Eusebiusof Nicomedia:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Euthymius the Great", "body": "Saint Euthymius (377-473), often styled the Great, was an Abbot in Palestine.\\n\\nVenerated in both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.\\n\\nHe was born in Melitene in Lesser Armenia. Christian tradition states that his parents had prayed for a son at the church of Saint Polyeuctus in Melitene.\\n\\nHe was educated by Bishop Otreius of Melitene, who afterwards ordained him priest and placed him in charge of all the monasteries in the Diocese of Melitene. At about thirty years of age he secretly set out on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and remained for some time in a cave near a settlement of monks at a laura called Pharan, about six miles east of Jerusalem.\\n\\nIn 411 he withdrew, with St. Theoctistus, a fellow-hermit, into the wilderness, living in a rough cavern on the banks of a torrent. When many disciples gathered around them they turned the cavern into a church and built a monastery which was placed in the charge of St. Theoctistus. Euthymius, despite retaining his solitary lifestyle, gave direction for the others.\\n\\nA miraculous cure which Euthymius was believed to have effected for Terebon, the son of the Saracen chief Aspebetus, spread the fame of the holy hermit far beyond the confines of Palestine. Aspebetus was afterwards ordained priest and became bishop over his tribe, in which capacity he attended the Council of Ephesus in 431. \\n\\nWhen the report of this miracle had made the name of Euthymius famous throughout Palestine, and large crowds came to visit him in his solitude, he retreated with his disciple Domitian to the wilderness of Ruba, near the Dead Sea, living for some time on a remote mountain called Marda, whence he afterwards withdrew to the desert of Zipho (the ancient Engaddi).\\n\\nWhen large crowds followed him to this place also, he returned to the neighbourhood of the monastery of Theoctistus, where he took up his abode in a cavern. Every Sunday he came to the monastery to take part in the Divine services. At length, because numerous disciples desired him as their spiritual guide, he founded in 420, on the right side of the road from Jerusalem to Jericho, a laura similar to that of Pharan. The church connected with this laura was dedicated in 428 by Juvenal, the first Patriarch of Jerusalem.\\n\\nWhen the Fourth Œcumenical Synod (451) condemned the errors of Eutyches and Dioscorus, it was greatly due to the authority of Euthymius that most of the Eastern recluses accepted its decrees. The empress Eudoxia was converted to Catholic unity through his efforts.\\n\\nThe Church celebrates his feast on 20 January, the day of his death. \\n\\n"}

Amanda Maiden portrayed Eve in a 2003 flashback at age 16, and later still Kimberly Kevon Williams replaced Maiden in a flashback to Eve's past when she was 18.\\n\\nEve is the daughter of Warren Johnson and his wife Ruby Lincoln Johnson. Eve grew up in the south. After her father's death her mother married a man named Mr. Sanbourne and the two adopted a daughter named Liz. Eve eventually left her home as a teenager and went to Boston where she became a singer and was involved in prostitution and drugs. Boston is where she first met Julian Crane and old friend Crystal Harris. Julian and Eve fell in love but eventually Eve became pregnant and the two broke up. Eve gave birth to the baby with her best friend Crystal there for support. Eve had been told the baby died, but she later came to doubt the truth of that information and eventually it was revealed that Vincent Clarkson was her long lost son with Julian. Some time later Eve turned her life around, gave up singing, devoted herself to medicine and became a doctor. Eventually she came to Harmony and married a man named T.C. Russell with whom she had two daughters Whitney Russell and Simone Russell. Eve kept her past a secret hoping her children wouldn't make the same mistakes she had made in her youth.\\n\\nEve's past was unearthed by Ivy Winthrop who blackmailed her into helping break up the marriage of Sam Bennett & Grace Bennett. Soon after Eve's supposed half sister Liz Sanbourne arrived in town and made it her mission to destroy any happiness in Eve's life. Liz blamed Eve for leaving the family and the molestation that Liz suffered at the hands of her adopted father Mr. Sanbourne. Liz used Irma the sister of Eve's father to reveal all of Eve's secrets which destroyed her relationship with her husband and children. It was at this point that Eve (and the rest of Harmony) assumed her pregnant daughter's boyfriend Chad Harris was in fact Eve's son with Julian and thus her children were committing incest (it would later be revealed Liz had given birth to Chad after being raped by Julian's father and that Liz was adopted).

But the love that they shared was still there, though neither acted upon it. Eve confessed her part in Ivy's schemes in breaking up the Bennett family, and Eve blamed herself when Grace was assassinated in England.

{"title": "Evel Knievel", "body": "Evel Knievel (;) (October 17, 1938 – November 30, 2007), born Robert Craig Knievel, was an American daredevil and entertainer. In his career he attempted over 75 ramp-to-ramp motorcycle jumps between 1965 and 1980, and in 1974, a jump across Snake River Canyon in the Skycycle X-2, a steam-powered rocket. The 37 broken bones he suffered during his career earned an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records as the survivor of \"most bones broken in a lifetime.\" Knievel died of pulmonary disease in Clearwater, Florida, aged 69. According to The Times writing his obituary, Knievel was one of the greatest American icons of the 1970s. Knievel was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1999.\\n\\nKnievel was born in Butte, Montana, in 1938, and raised by his grand-parents. After watching a Joie Chitwood auto daredevil show as a child, he took to jumping using a push bike, later moving onto motorcycles. As a troubled youth, he earned his stagename after occupying a jail cell next to a man named Knofel, leading the jailer to refer to the pair as Awful Knofel and Evil Knievel (Knievel later changed the spelling of the first name to Evel). In addition to stunt riding at local shows, his early life including a spell in the United States Army at the behest of a magistrate, as well as jobs as a hunting guide, an insurance salesman, while also becoming an ice-hockey team owner and running a business protection racket. In these early years, Evel notably stopped an Elk cull in Yellowstone national park, and staged an exhibition match against the Czechoslovakian hockey team ahead of the 1960 Winter Olympics in California. After moving into sports full time, he had moderate success on the motocross circuit.\\n\\nKnievel moved into the entertainment business in 1966 by setting up his own daredevil show, initially using a variety of performers and touring several US states, and later converting it to a solo show focused entirely on his jumps as the centre-piece. He came to national attention when he persuaded the owners of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to let him jump their fountain on New Year's Eve 1967, which was filmed for ABC. After a failed landing, he spent 29 days in a coma. On his recovery, he continued to make high profile and lucrative jumps, began lobbying the government for permission to jump the Grand Canyon. When this failed, he settled on the Snake River jump in Twin Falls, Idaho. Proving to be his most spectacular feat, he jumped it on September 8, 1978 in the Skycycle, which was essentially an unguided missile. After the launch, the arresting parachute deployed early, meaning the vehicle floated down on the far side landing feet from the river's edge, with Knievel suffering minor injuries. Knievel then travelled to Britain, and on May 26, 1975, attempted to jump 13 buses infront of 90,000 people at Wembley Stadium, again landing but with severe injuries. His furthest completed career jump then came at Kings Island theme park in Ohio October 25, 1975, jumping 14 buses, marking his peak television audience. After this jump, Knievel's jumps became smaller, and he eventually withdrew from doing major shows after cancelling an attempt to jump a tank full of live sharks in Chicago after injuring himself and a cameraman during a practice jump. He instead concentrated on touring with and training his son Robbie Knievel, also a daredevil, eventually making his last jump in March 1981.\\n\\nIn his career heyday, Knievel's nationally televised motorcycle jumps were four of the twenty most-watched ABC's Wide World of Sports events to date. He became a celebrity, recognisable for his use of a Stars-and-Stripes red white and blue \"#1\" set of motorcycle leathers and cape. On the back of this fame, Kneivel gained endorsements such as from Harley-Davidson and a toy line by the Ideal Toy Company. A 1971 film Evel Knievel starred George Hamilton as Kneivel, and he starred as himself in the 1977 film Viva Knievel!. In 1977, Knievel served six months in jail for assaulting his Snake River promoter Shelly Saltman for writing an unflattering book. After this conviction, Knievel's career suffered, causing him to declare bankruptcy. In 1981, Saltman was awarded $13 million in damages, although he was never paid. Knievel later said of his career that he had \"earned $60 million, and spent $63 million\".\\n\\nRobert Craig \"Evel\" Knievel was born in Butte, Montana, in 1938, the first of two children born to Robert E. and Ann Keough \"Zippy\" Knievel. His surname is of German origin; his great-great-grandparents on his father's side emigrated to the United States from Germany. Robert and Ann divorced in 1940, after the birth of their second child, Nic. Both parents decided to leave Butte. Robert and Nic were raised by paternal grandparents, Ignatius and Emma Knievel. At the age of eight, he attended a Joie Chitwood Auto Daredevil Show, to which he gave credit for his later career choice to become a motorcycle daredevil.\\n\\nKnievel ended high school after his sophomore year and got a job in the copper mines with the Anaconda Mining Company as a diamond drill operator. However, he preferred motorbiking to all this 'unimportant stuff' as he put it. He was then promoted to surface duty where he drove a large earth mover. Knievel was fired when he made the earth mover do a motorcycle-type wheelie and drove it into Butte's main power line. The incident left the city without electricity for several hours. Idle, Knievel began to find himself in more and more trouble around Butte. After a police chase in 1956 in which he crashed his motorcycle, Knievel was taken to jail on a charge of reckless driving. When the night jailer came around to check the roll, he noted Robert Knievel in one cell and William Knofel in the other. Knofel was well known as \"Awful Knofel\" (\"awful\" rhyming with \"Knofel\") so Knievel began to be referred to as Evel Knievel (\"Evel\" rhyming with \"Knievel\"). He chose this misspelling because of his last name and because he didn't want to be considered \"evil\".\\n\\nAlways looking for new thrills and challenges, Knievel participated in local professional rodeo and ski jumping events, including winning the Northern Rocky Mountain Ski Association Class A Men's ski jumping championship in 1959. During the late 1950s, Knievel joined the United States Army. His athletic ability allowed him to join the track team where he was a pole vault. After his army stint, Knievel returned to Butte where he met and married his first wife, Linda Joan Bork.\\n\\nShortly after getting married, Knievel started the Butte Bombers, a semi-pro hockey team. To help promote his team and earn some money, he convinced the 1960 Olympic Czechoslovakia hockey team to play the Butte Bombers in a warm-up game to the Olympics. Knievel was ejected from the game minutes into the third period and left the stadium. When the Czechoslovakian officials went to the box office to collect the expense money the team was promised, workers discovered the game receipts had been stolen. The United States Olympic Committee wound up paying the Czechoslovakian team's expenses to avoid an international incident. Evel Knievel also played with the Charlotte Checkers of the Eastern Hockey League.\\n\\nAfter the birth of his first son, Kelly, Knievel realized that he needed to come up with a new way to support his family financially. Using the hunting and fishing skills his grandfather had taught him, Knievel started the Sur-Kill Guide Service. He guaranteed that if a hunter employed his service and paid his fee, they would get the big game animal they wanted or he would refund their money. Business was very good until game warden realized that Knievel was taking his clients into Yellowstone National Park to find prey. The Park Service ordered Knievel to cease and desist this poaching.\\n\\nIn response Knievel, who was learning about the culling of elk in Yellowstone, decided to hitchhike from Butte to Washington, D.C. in December 1961 to raise awareness and to have the elk relocated to areas where hunting was permitted. After his conspicuous trek (he hitchhiked with a  rack of elk antlers and a petition with 3,000 signatures), he presented his case to Representative Arnold Olsen, Senator Mike Mansfield and Interior Secretary Stewart Udall. As a result of his efforts, the culling was stopped, and the animals have since been regularly captured and relocated to areas of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.\\n\\nAfter returning home from Washington, Knievel decided to stop committing crime. He joined the motocross circuit and had moderate success, but he still couldn't make enough money to support his family. During 1962, Knievel broke his collarbone and shoulder in a motocross accident. The doctors said he couldn't race for at least six months. To help support his family, he switched careers and sold insurance for the Combined Insurance Company of America, working for W. Clement Stone. Stone suggested that Knievel read Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude, a book that Stone wrote with Napoleon Hill. Knievel credited much of his success to Stone and his book.\\n\\nKnievel was successful as an insurance salesman (even selling insurance policies to several institutionalized mental patients) and wanted recognition for his efforts. When the company refused to promote him to vice-president after a few months on the job he quit. Wanting a new start away from Butte, Knievel moved his family to Moses Lake, Washington. There, he opened a Honda motorcycle dealership and promoted motocross racing. During the early 1960s, it was difficult to promote Japan imports. People still considered them inferior to American built motorcycles, and there was lingering resentment from World War II, which had ended less than 20 years earlier. Once, Knievel offered a $100 discount to anybody who could beat him at arm wrestling. Despite his best efforts the business eventually had to be closed.\\n\\nAfter the closure of the Moses Lake Honda dealership, Knievel went to work for Don Pomeroy at his motorcycle shop in Sunnyside, Washington. It is here where Jim Pomeroy, a well known motocross racer taught Knievel how to do a \"wheelie\" and ride while standing on the seat of the bike.\\n\\nWhile trying to support his family, Knievel recalled the Joie Chitwood show he saw as a boy and decided that he could do something similar using a motorcycle. Promoting the show himself, Knievel rented the venue, wrote the press releases, set up the show, sold the tickets and served as his own master of ceremonies. After enticing the small crowd with a few wheelies, he proceeded to jump a twenty-foot-long box of rattlesnakes and two mountain lion. Despite landing short and having his back wheel hit the box containing the rattlesnakes, Knievel managed to land safely.\\n\\nKnievel realized to make any amount of real money he would need to hire more performers, stunt coordinators and other personnel so that he could concentrate on the jumps. With little money, he went looking for a sponsor and found one in Bob Blair, owner of ZDS Motors, Inc., the West coast distributor for Berliner Motor Corporation, a distributor for Norton Motorcycles. Blair offered to provide the needed motorcycles, but he wanted the name changed from the Bobby Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils Thrill Show to Evil Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils. Knievel didn't want his image to be that of a Hells Angels rider, so he convinced Blair to allow him to use Evel instead of Evil.\\n\\nThe debut of Knievel and his daredevils was on January 3, 1966, at the National Date Festival in Indio, California. The show was a huge success. Knievel received several offers to host the show after their first performance. The second booking was in Hemet, California, but was canceled due to rain. The next performance was on February 10, in Barstow, California. During the performance, Knievel attempted a new stunt where he would jump, spread eagle, over a speeding motorcycle. Knievel jumped too late and the motorcycle hit him in the groin, tossing him fifteen feet into the air. He was placed in the hospital as a result of his injuries. When released, he returned to Barstow to finish the performance he had started almost a month earlier.\\n\\nKnievel's daredevil show broke up after the Barstow performance because injuries prevented him from performing. After recovering, Knievel started traveling from small town to small town as a solo act. To get ahead of other motorcycle stunt people who were jumping animals or pools of water, Knievel started jumping cars. He began adding more and more cars to his jumps when he would return to the same venue to get people to come out and see him again. Knievel hadn't had a serious injury since the Barstow performance, but on June 19 in Missoula, Montana, he attempted to jump twelve cars and a cargo van. The distance he had for takeoff didn't allow him to get up enough speed. His back wheel hit the top of the van while his front wheel hit the top of the landing ramp. Knievel ended up with a severely broken arm and several broken ribs. The crash and subsequent stay in the hospital were a publicity windfall.\\n\\nWith each successful jump, the public wanted him to jump one more car. On May 30, 1967, Knievel successfully cleared sixteen cars in Gardena, California. Then he attempted the same jump on July 28, 1967, in Graham, Washington, where he had his next serious crash. Landing his cycle on a panel truck that was the last vehicle, Knievel was thrown from his bike. This time he suffered a serious concussion. After a month, he recovered and returned to Graham on August 18 to finish the show; but the result was the same, only this time the injuries were more serious. Again coming up short, Knievel crashed, breaking his left wrist, right knee and two ribs.\\n\\nKnievel finally received some national exposure when actor Joey Bishop had him on as a guest of The Joey Bishop Show. All the attention not only brought larger paydays, but also female admirers.\\n\\nWhile in Las Vegas, to watch Dick Tiger successfully defend his WBA and WBC light heavyweight titles at the Las Vegas Convention Center on November 17, 1967, Knievel first saw the fountains at Caesars Palace and decided to jump them. To get an audience with the casino's CEO Jay Sarno, Knievel created a fictitious corporation called Evel Knievel Enterprises and three fictitious lawyers to make phone calls to Sarno. Knievel also placed phone calls to Sarno claiming to be from ABC-TV and Sports Illustrated inquiring about the jump. Sarno finally agreed to meet Knievel and the deal was set for Knievel to jump the fountains on December 31, 1967. After the deal was set, Knievel tried to get ABC to air the event live on Wide World of Sports. ABC declined, but said that if Knievel had the jump filmed and it was as spectacular as he said it would be, they would consider using it later.\\n\\nKnievel used his own money to have actor/director John Derek produce a film of the Caesars' jump. To keep costs low, Derek used his then-wife Linda Evans as one of the camera operators. It was Evans who filmed Knievel's famous landing. On the morning of the jump, Knievel stopped in the casino and placed his last 100 dollars on the blackjack table (which he lost), stopped by the bar and had a shot of Wild Turkey and then headed outside where he was joined by several members of the Caesars staff, as well as two showgirl. After doing his normal pre-jump show and a few warm up approaches, Knievel began his real approach. When he hit the takeoff ramp, he felt the motorcycle unexpectedly decelerate. The sudden loss of power on the takeoff caused Knievel to come up short and land on the safety ramp which was supported by a van. This caused the handlebars to be ripped out of his hands as he tumbled over them onto the pavement where he skidded into the Dunes parking lot. As a result of the crash, Knievel suffered a crushed pelvis and femur, fractures to his hip, wrist and both ankles and a concussion that kept him in a coma for 29 days.\\n\\nBefore the Caesars' jump Knievel asked his friend Matt Tonning, a Combined Insurance sales agent, to sell him ten accident policies. Combined's underwriting policies allowed for only one of these policies be written, since the policy covered any accident and was non-cancelable for the life of the insured. Tonning agreed and was fired by Combined when Knievel filed the claims on all ten. Upon hearing that Tonning had been fired Knievel contacted Combined's Vice President Matt Walsh. He agreed to return nine of the policies and be paid full benefits on only one, if Combined allowed Tonning to return to work. Walsh agreed and Tonning was reinstated.\\n\\nThe Caesars Palace crash would represent Knievel's longest attempted motorcycle jump at 141 feet. After his crash and recovery Knievel was more famous than ever. ABC-TV bought the rights to the film of the jump paying far more than they originally would have had they televised the original jump live. Ironically, when Knievel finally achieved the fame and possible fortune that he always wanted, his doctors were telling him that he might never walk without the aid of crutches, let alone ride and jump motorcycles.\\n\\nTo keep his name in the news, Knievel started describing his biggest stunt ever, a motorcycle jump across the Grand Canyon. Just five months after his near fatal crash, Knievel performed another jump. On May 25, 1968, in Scottsdale, Arizona, Knievel crashed while attempting to jump fifteen Ford Mustang. Knievel ended up breaking his right leg and foot as a result of the crash.\\n\\nOn August 3, 1968, Knievel returned to jumping, making more money than ever before. He was earning approximately $25,000 per performance, and he was making successful jumps almost weekly until October 13, in Carson City, Nevada. While trying to stick the landing, he lost control of the bike and crashed again, breaking his hip once more.\\n\\nBy 1971, Knievel realized that the United States government would never allow him to jump the Grand Canyon. To keep his fans interested, Knievel considered several other stunts that might match the publicity that would have been generated by jumping the canyon; ideas included: jumping across the Mississippi River, jumping from one skyscraper to another in New York City and jumping over 13 cars inside the Houston Astrodome. While flying back to Butte from a performance tour, Knievel looked out the window and saw Snake River Canyon. After finding a location near Twin Falls, Idaho, that was both wide enough, deep enough and on private property, Knievel leased  for $35,000 to stage his jump. He set the date for Labor Day (September 4), 1972.\\n\\nOn January 7 and January 8, 1971, Knievel set the record by selling over 100,000 tickets to back-to-back performances at the Houston Astrodome. On February 28, he set a new world record by jumping 19 cars with his Harley-Davidson XR-750 in Ontario, California. The 19 car jump was also filmed for the movie, Evel Knievel. Knievel held the record for 27 years until Bubba Blackwell jumped 20 cars in 1998 with an XR-750.\\n\\nOn May 10, Knievel crashed while attempting to jump 13 Pepsi delivery trucks. His approach was complicated by the fact that he had to start on pavement, cut across grass, and then return to pavement. His lack of speed caused the motorcycle to come down front wheel first. He managed to hold on until the cycle hit the base of the ramp. After being thrown off he skidded for . Knievel broke his collarbone, suffered a compound fracture of his right arm and broke both legs.\\n\\nOn March 3, 1972, at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California, after making a successful jump, he tried to come to a quick stop because of a short landing area. Knievel suffered a broken back and a concussion after getting thrown off and run over by his motorcycle, a Harley-Davidson. Knievel returned to jumping in November, 1973, where he successfully jumped over 50 stacked cars at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. For 35 years, Knievel held the record for successfully jumping the most stacked cars on a Harley-Davidson XR-750 (the record was broken in October 2008. His historic XR-750 is now part of the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Made of steel, aluminum and fiberglass, the customized motorcycle weighs about 300 pounds.\\n\\nAlthough Knievel never attempted to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968 following the Caesars' Palace crash. During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, \"I don't care if they say, 'Look, kid, you're going to drive that thing off the edge of the Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it. I want to be the first. If they'd let me go to the moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it. I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there.\" For the next several years, Knievel would negotiate with the U.S. government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump. However, the U.S. Department of Interior denied him airspace over the Grand Canyon. Therefore, in 1971, Knievel switched his attention to the Snake River Canyon. \\n\\nIn the movie, ''Evel Knievel'', George Hamilton (as Knievel) alludes to the Canyon jump in the final scene of the movie. One of the common movie posters for the 1971 film depicts Knievel jumping his motorcycle off a (likely) Grand Canyon cliff. In 1999, Knievel's son, Robbie, jumped a portion of the Grand Canyon owned by the Hualapai Indian Reservation.\\n\\nABC Sports was unwilling to pay the price Knievel wanted for the Snake River Canyon jump, so he ended up hiring Bob Arum's company, Top Rank Productions, to put the event on closed circuit television and broadcast to movie theaters. Then WWF Promoters Don E. Branker and Vince McMahon, Sr., were later said to be silent promoters of this event. Arum partnered with Invest West Sports, Shelly Saltman's company, to secure from Invest West Sports two things: 1.) the necessary financing for the jump and 2.) the services of Saltman, long recognized as one of America's premier public relations and promotion men, to do publicity so that Knievel could concentrate on his jumps. Knievel then hired subcontractor and aeronautical engineer Doug Malewicki to build him a rocket-powered cycle that he could use to jump across the Snake River, to be called the X-1 Skycycle. Doug's creation was powered by a steam engine built by former Aerojet engineer Robert Truax. On April 15, 1972 the X-1 was launched to test the feasibility of the launching ramp. The decision was then made to have Truax build the Skycycle X-2 and have it take off and fly more like a rocket than a motorcycle.\\n\\nThe launch at Snake River Canyon () was on September 8, 1974, at 3:36 p.m. MDT. The steam that powered the engine was superheated to a temperature of . Upon take-off, the drogue parachute deployed. The deployed chute caused enough drag that even though the skycycle made it all the way across the canyon to the north rim, the prevailing winds caused it to drift back south, into the canyon. By the time it hit the bottom of the canyon, it landed only a few feet from the water on the same side of the canyon it had been launched from. If he had landed in the water, Knievel would have drowned due to a jumpsuit/harness malfunction which kept him strapped in the vehicle. Knievel survived the jump with only minor injuries.\\n\\nAfter the Snake River jump, Knievel returned to motorcycle jumping with ABC Wide World of Sports televising several jumps. On May 26, 1975, in front of 90,000 people at Wembley Stadium in London, Knievel crashed while trying to land a jump over thirteen redundant single-deck AEC Merlin buses (the term \"London Buses\" used in earlier publicity had led to the belief that the attempt was to be made over the higher and more traditional Routemaster double-deck type). After the crash, despite breaking his pelvis, Knievel addressed the audience and announced his retirement. Near shock and not yielding to Frank Gifford's (of ABC Wide World of Sports) plea to use a stretcher, Knievel walked off the Wembley field stating, \"I came in walking, I went out walking!\"\\n\\nAfter recuperating, Knievel decided that he had spoken too soon, and that he would continue jumping. On October 25, 1975, Knievel successfully jumped fourteen Greyhound buses at the Kings Island theme park in Ohio. Although Knievel landed on the safety deck above the 14th bus, his landing was successful and he held the record for jumping the most buses on a Harley-Davidson for 24 years (until broken by Bubba Blackwell in late 1999). The Kings Island event scored the highest viewer ratings in the history of ABC's Wide World of Sports and would serve as Knievel's longest successful jump at 133 feet (although the Caesars Palace jump was longer, it ended in a crash). After the Kings Island jump, Knievel again announced his retirement.\\n\\nAgain, his retirement was short lived and Knievel continued to jump. However, after the lengthy Kings Island jump, Knievel limited the remainder of his career jumps to shorter and more attainable lengths. Evel jumped on October 31, 1976, at the Seattle Kingdome. He only jumped seven Greyhound Buses but it was a success. Despite the crowd's pleasure, Knievel felt that it was not his best jump, and apologized to the crowd.\\n\\nIn the winter of 1976, Knievel was scheduled for a major jump in Chicago, Illinois. The jump was inspired by the film, Jaws. Knievel was scheduled to jump a tank full of live sharks and would be televised live nationally. However, during his rehearsal, Knievel lost control of the motorcycle and crashed into a cameraman. Although Knievel broke his arms, he was more distraught over a permanent injury his accident caused to the cameraman (who lost his eye). The footage of this crash was so upsetting to Knievel, that he did not show the clip for 19 years until the documentary, Absolute Evel: The Evel Knievel Story.\\n\\nAfter the failed shark jump, Knievel retired from major performances and limited his appearances to smaller venues to help launch the career of his son, Robbie Knievel. His last stunt show, not including a jump, took place in March 1980 in Puerto Rico. However, Knievel would officially finish his career as a daredevil as a touring \"companion\" of his son, Robbie, limiting his performance to speaking only, rather than stunt riding. His last appearance with Robbie (on tour) was in March 1981 in Hollywood, Florida.\\n\\nThe Last Gladiator is an honorific title or nickname for Evel Knievel. The term Last Gladiator was coined and attributed to Knievel circa 1971. The term refers to the Roman gladiator, who entered an arena to fight numerous foes to which he may succumb death with skill and bravery.\\n\\nThe term was made popular in the 1971 eponymous movie starring George Hamilton. In the movie, Hamilton (as Knievel) states, \"I am the last gladiator in the new Rome. I go into the arena and I compete against destruction and I win. And next week, I go out there and I do it again.\"\\n\\nEvel Knievel's 1988 self-produced documentary was entitled, \"Last of the Gladiators\".\\n\\nKnievel briefly used a Honda 350cc motorcycle, using it to jump a crate of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions, which was his first known jump. Knievel then used a Norton Motorcycle Company 750cc. He used the Norton for only one year during 1966. Between 1967 and 1968, Knievel jumped using the Triumph Bonneville T120 (with a 650cc engine). Knievel used the Triumph at the Caesars Palace crash on New Year's Eve 1967. When Knievel returned to jumping after the crash, he used Triumph for the remainder of 1968.\\n\\nBetween December 1969 and April 1970, Knievel used the Laverda American Eagle 750cc motorcycle. On December 12, 1970, Knievel would switch to the Harley-Davidson XR-750, the motorcycle with which he is best known for jumping. Knievel would use the XR-750 in association with Harley-Davidson until 1977. However, after his 1977 conviction for the assault of Shelly Saltman, Harley-Davidson withdrew their sponsorship of Knievel.\\n\\nOn September 8, 1974, Knievel attempted to jump the Snake River Canyon on a rocket propelled motorcycle designed by former NASA engineer Robert Truax dubbed the Skycycle X-2. The State of Idaho registered the X-2 as an airplane rather than a motorcycle.\\n\\nAt the tail end of his career, while helping launch the career of his son, Robbie Knievel, Knievel returned to the Triumph T120. However, he only performed wheelies and did not jump after retiring the XR-750.\\n\\nIn 1997, Knievel signed with the California Motorcycle Company to release a limited Evel Knievel Motorcycle. However, the motorcycle was not built to jump, but was rather a V-twin cruiser motorcycle intended to compete with Harley-Davidson street bikes. Knievel promoted the motorcycle at his various public appearances. After the company closed in 2003, Knievel returned to riding modern street Harley-Davidson motorcycles at his public appearances.\\n\\nEvel's son, Robbie Knievel, is currently selling limited-edition motorcycles from his company, Knievel Motorcycles Manufacturing Inc. Although two of the motorcycles refer to Evel (the Legend Series Evel Commemorative and the Snake River Canyon motorcycle), Evel did not ride Robbie's bikes.\\n\\nOne of Evel's qualities was that he had great pride in his core values. Throughout his career (and later life), he would repeatedly talk about the importance of \"keeping his word\". He stated that although he knew he may not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would. Prior to the canyon jump, Knievel stated, \"If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon. You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.' Do me a favor. Tell him that you saw me here and regardless of what I was, that you knew me, and that I kept my word.\"\\n\\nIn the documentary Last of the Gladiators, Knievel discussed the crash of a 1970 Pepsi-Cola sponsored jump in Yakima, Washington. Knievel knew the jump was questionable, but stated, \"I went ahead and did it anyway. When you give your word to somebody that you're going to do something, you've gotta do it.\" In the 1971 biopic, George Hamilton (as Evel) emphasizes in the opening monologue that a man does not go back on his word.\\n\\nKnievel would regularly share his anti-drug message, as it was another one of his core values. Knievel would preach an anti-drug message to children and adults before each of his stunts. One organization that Knievel regularly slammed for being drug dealers was the Hells Angels. A near-riot erupted on March 3, 1971, at the Cow Palace when a tire-iron (or coke can according to the Hells Angels) was thrown at Knievel during his stunt show, and Knievel and a majority of the spectators fought back, sending three of the fifteen Hells Angels to the hospital. The plot to his only motion picture as an actor, Viva Knievel, centers around Evel foiling the attempts of drug lords smuggling narcotics into America from Mexico.\\n\\nKnievel constantly stated to young fans to wear their helmets when riding. He stated that his life was saved during the well known Cesars Palace crash when his head hit the wall during his slide from the motorcycle and his helmet protected him from head injury. Upon autographing a helmet he stated \"Make sure you wear it, it can save your life\" \\n\\nKnievel was married twice. He and his first wife, Linda, were legally married for 38 years. During their marriage, the couple had four children. Of the two boys and two girls, the oldest child Kelly and second-born Robbie are the boys and Tracey and youngest child Alicia are the girls. Throughout Kelly's and Robbie's adolescence, the boys performed at Knievel's stunt shows. Robbie Knievel continued into adulthood to perform as a professional motorcycle daredevil. After Evel's death, Kelly has overseen the Knievel legacy, including developing Knievel-related products and assisting Harley-Davidson develop a museum exhibit. Knievel's courtship and marriage to Linda was the theme of the 1971 George Hamilton movie, Evel Knievel. Linda and Evel were legally divorced in 1997.\\n\\nIn 1999, Knievel remarried his girlfriend, Krystal Kennedy, whom he began dating in 1992. The marriage was held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The couple were married for two years, divorcing in 2001. Following the divorce, Krystal Knievel was granted a restraining order against him. However, Krystal and Evel would work out their differences, living together until Knievel's death. According to the investment magazine, Registered Rep., Knievel left his entire estate to Krystal.\\n\\nKnievel sought to make more money off of his image. He was no longer satisfied with just receiving free motorcycles to jump with. Knievel wanted to be paid to use and promote a company's brand of motorcycles. After Triumph, the motorcycle company he had been jumping with, refused to meet his demands, Knievel started to propose the idea to other manufacturers. American Eagle Motorcycles was the first company to sign Knievel to an endorsement deal. At approximately the same time, Fanfare Films started production of Evel Knievel, a 1971 movie starring George Hamilton as Knievel. There have been two other movies made about Evel: A television pilot made in 1974 starring Sam Elliott, and made-for-TV film in 2004 starring George Eads. Also in 1974, Evel and Amherst Records released the self title album \"Evel Knievel\" which included a press conference, an anti-drug talk for his young fans, and four other tracks.\\n\\nKnievel kept up his pursuit of getting the United States government to allow him to jump the Grand Canyon. To push his case, he hired famed San Francisco defense attorney Melvin Belli to fight the legal battle in obtaining government permission. ABC's Wide World of Sports started showing Knievel's jumps on television regularly. His popularity, especially with young boys, was ever increasing. He became a hero to a generation of young boys, many of whom were injured trying to imitate his stunts. A. J. Foyt made Knievel part of his pit crew for the Indianapolis 500 in 1970. Evel Knievel's huge fame caused him to start traveling with a bodyguard, Boots Curtis. Curtis became a long time friend to Knievel.\\n\\nLater in the decade, the merchandising of the Knievel image reached additional media. Ideal Toys released a bendable Knievel action figure in 1972; along with a host of accessories, there was also a female counterpart available—Derry Daring. In 1977, Bally marketed its Knievel pinball machine as the \"first fully electronic commercial game\"; it has elsewhere been described as one of the \"last of the classic pre-digital games.\" (Both electromechanical and solid state versions were produced. The electromechanical version is extremely rare, with only 155 made).\\n\\nKnievel made several television appearances, including a guest spot on The Bionic Woman where he played himself. He was a frequent guest on talk shows such as Dinah! and Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. On January 31, 1977, during a dress rehearsal for a CBS special on live daredevil stunts at the Chicago International Amphitheatre, Knievel crashed, breaking both arms and his collarbone. In the process, a misplaced cameraman was injured, losing an eye. In June 1977, Warner Bros. released Viva Knievel!, a movie starring Knievel as himself and co-starring Lauren Hutton, Gene Kelly and Red Buttons. The movie was a box office smash.\\n\\nWhile Knievel was healing from his latest round of injuries, the book Evel Knievel on Tour was released. Authored by Knievel's promoter for the Snake River Canyon jump, Shelly Saltman, the book painted an unflattering picture of Knievel's character, alleging that he abused his wife and kids and he used drugs. Knievel, with both arms still in casts, flew to California to confront Saltman, a VP at 20th Century Fox. Outside the studio commissary, one of Knievel's friends grabbed Saltman and held him, while Knievel attacked him with an aluminum baseball bat, declaring, \"I'm going to kill you!\" According to a witness to the attack, Knievel struck repeated blows at Saltman's head, with Saltman blocking the blows with his left arm. Saltman's arm and wrist were shattered in several places before he fell to the ground unconscious. It took numerous surgeries and permanent metal plates in his arm to eventually give Saltman back the use of his arm. Saltman's book was pulled from the shelves by the publisher after Knievel threatened to sue. Saltman later produced documents in both criminal and civil court that proved that, although Knievel claimed to have been insulted by statements in Saltman's book, he and his lawyers had actually been given editorial access to the book and had approved and signed off on every word prior to its publication. On October 14, 1977, Knievel pleaded guilty to battery and was sentenced to three years probation and six months in county jail, during which he publicly flaunted his brief incarceration for the press.\\n\\nAfter the assault of Saltman and time served in jail, Knievel lost most marketing endorsements and deals, including Harley-Davidson and Ideal Toys. With no income from jumping or sponsorship, Knievel was eventually forced to declare bankruptcy. In 1981, Saltman was awarded a $13 million judgment against Knievel in a civil trial, but never received money from Knievel or Knievel's estate.\\n\\nDuring the 1980s, Knievel would drive around the country in a recreational vehicle, selling works of art allegedly painted by him. After several years of obscurity, Knievel made a significant marketing comeback in the 1990s, representing Maxim Casino, Little Caesar's, Harley-Davidson, and other firms.\\n\\nIn 1999, Knievel celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Snake River Canyon jump at the Twin Falls mall. His memorabilia was then stored at Kent Knigge's farm in Filer, Idaho, seven miles west of Twin Falls. During the same year, Knievel was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame.\\n\\nOn November 19, 1999, on a special platform built on the fountains at Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip near Las Vegas, Nevada (site of Evel's jump New Year's Eve 1967), Evel married long time girlfriend, 30-year-old Krystal Kennedy of Clearwater, Florida. Long-time friend Engelbert Humperdinck sent a recorded tribute to the couple. They were divorced in 2001 but remained together until his death.\\n\\nOn October 9, 2005, Knievel promoted his last public \"motorcycle ride\" at the Milwaukee Harley-Davidson dealership. The ride was to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina. Although he was originally scheduled to lead a benefit ride through Milwaukee, Knievel never rode the motorcycle because he suffered a mild (non-debilitating) stroke prior to the appearance and limited his visit to a signing session.\\n\\nOn July 27, 2006, on The Adam Carolla Show, Knievel said that he had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and required supplemental oxygen therapy 24 hours a day.\\n\\nOn July 28, 2006, at Evel Knievel Days in Butte, Robbie jumped 196 feet in a tribute to his father, Evel. Robbie also appeared on stage with his father.\\n\\nShortly before his death, Knievel was saluted by Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond in a BBC2 Christmas special. The sixty minute programme Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel aired on December 23, 2007, less than a month after his death. The documentary was filmed in July 2007 around the annual \"Evel Knievel Days\" festival in his old home town of Butte. Knievel was clearly in severely declining health, but he still displayed the same spirit and showmanship that had driven his career.\\n\\nOn April 1, 2007, Knievel appeared on Rev. Robert H. Schuller's Hour of Power television program and announced that he \"believed in Jesus Christ\" for the first time.\\n\\nAt his request, he was baptized before the congregation and TV cameras by Dr. Schuller, Founding Pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. Christianity Today reported that \"...Knievel's testimony triggered mass baptisms at the Crystal Cathedral.\"\\n\\nIn 2003, Knievel signed over exclusive rights to Los Angeles composer Jef Bek, authorizing the production of a rock opera based on Knievel's life. Directed by Bat Boy co-creator Keythe Farley, the production opened in Los Angeles in September 2007 to excellent reviews.\\n\\nEvel Knievel had partnered with Six Flags St. Louis to name a new wooden coaster after \"America's Legendary Daredevil\". The amusement park in Eureka, Missouri, outside of St. Louis, Missouri, opened the ride on June 20, 2008. The Evel Knievel Roller Coaster operated for three seasons before being renamed American Thunder in 2011.\\n\\nIn the late 1990s, Knievel was in need of a life-saving liver transplant as a result of suffering the long-term effects from Hepatitis C. He contracted the disease after one of the numerous blood transfusions he received prior to 1992. In February 1999, Knievel was given only a few days to live and he requested to leave the hospital and die at his home. En route to his home, Knievel received a phone call from the hospital stating a young man had died in a motorcycle accident and could be a donor. Days later, Knievel successfully received the transplant.\\n\\nIn 2005, he was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an incurable and terminal lung disease that required him to be on supplemental oxygen 24 hours a day. In 2006, Evel had an internal morphine pain pump surgically implanted to help him with the excruciating pain in his deteriorated lower back, one of the costs of incurring so many traumas over the course of his career as a daredevil. He also had two strokes since 2005, but neither left him with severe debilitation.\\n\\nKnievel died in Clearwater, Florida, on November 30, 2007, aged 69. He had been suffering from diabetes and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for many years. A longtime friend reported that Knievel had trouble breathing while at his residence in Clearwater, but died before the ambulance could reach the hospital. \"It's been coming for years, but you just don't expect it. Superman just doesn't die, right?\" In one of his last interviews, he told Maxim Magazine, \"You can't ask a guy like me why [I performed]. I really wanted to fly through the air. I was a daredevil, a performer. I loved the thrill, the money, the whole macho thing. All those things made me Evel Knievel. Sure, I was scared. You gotta be an ass not to be scared. But I beat the hell out of death.\"\\n\\nKnievel was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in his hometown of Butte, Montana on December 10, 2007, following a funeral at the 7,500-seat Butte Civic Center presided over by Rev. Robert Schuller (actor Matthew McConaughey gave the eulogy). Prior to the Monday service, fireworks exploded in the Butte night sky as pallbearers carried Knievel's casket into the center.\\n\\nOn July 10, 2010, a special temporary exhibit entitled ''TRUE EVEL: The Amazing Story of Evel Knievel'' was opened at the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The exhibit was opened in collaboration with Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and Evel’s oldest son, Kelly. Among the various artifacts from Knievel’s life, the exhibit included his “Shark Jump” Harley-Davidson XR-750, the X-2 Skycycle, his “Wembley Blue” jumpsuit, and his trademark “red, white and blue” jumpsuit complete with his helmet and walking stick. Evel Knievel merchandising, personal artifacts, and X-rays from his injuries were also exhibited.\\n\\nThe TRUE EVEL exhibit ran for approximately two months and ended on September 6, 2010. In December 2010, a traveling version of TRUE EVEL began a one-year tour of the United Kingdom and Europe. The tour began on 4 December in Gateshead.\\n\\nIn November 2010, General Motors premiered a television commercial featuring Knievel's Wembley Stadium footage of the crash, followed by Knievel getting onto his feet. The ad focused on GM's restructuring and emphasized the belief that \"we all fall down\".\\n\\nThroughout and following Evel Knievel's active career as a daredevil, his persona and notoriety as a fearless daredevil has been parodied and paid tribute within media, including the following:\\n\\n"}

She was the only salaried woman artist of the painters and sculptors employed during World War II by the War Artists Advisory Committee (WAAC) Her businesslike production of official war art uniquely documented women's engagement with the war, especially \"land girls\" recruited to the Women's Land Army.\\n\\nEvelyn Mary Dunbar was born in Reading on 18 December 1906.\\n\\nEducated at Rochester Grammar School for Girls, Dunbar’s first foray into commercial artistry was illustrating children's stories. Prior to 1939, while still a student at The Royal College of Art, she worked collaboratively as a muralist, most significantly, in Brockley, Kent at Brockley Boys' School. Up to and during the production of 'The Brockley Murals' she had a close, if not romantic, association with her tutor, the artist Charles Mahoney (1903–1968). An enthusiastic gardener, she collaborated with Mahoney to write and illustrate Gardeners’ Choice (Routledge, 1937). Routledge had already noted the potential of Evelyn Dunbar as an illustrator when she added little pen and ink chapter motifs to The Scots Weekend and Caledonian Vade-Mecum for Host, Guest and Wayfarer, a 'cultural Scots holiday guide' edited by Donald and Catherine Carswell (1936).\\n\\nA later collaborative publication was A Book of Farmcraft (Longmans, 1942) with Michael Greenhill, a recruiter of Land Army girls at Sparsholt training centre out of which Dunbar's 'official war paintings' issued.\\n\\nIn 1942 Dunbar married a Royal Air Force auxiliary operative, Roger Folley, who was employed during and after World War II as an agricultural economist. The marriage was childless, but the couple became foster parents in the mid to late 1950s, fostering first one young boy then another adolescent during school holiday periods. The boys came from The Caldecott Community, a residential school for 'the maladjusted' founded by Leila Rendel and Phyllis Potter in 1911. \\n\\nIn 1956 ‘ED’, as she tended to sign her paintings, accepted an invitation by Dora Cohen, the charismatic founder principal of Bletchley Park Training College in Buckinghamshire to paint two large commemorative panels for the college library. The panels were based on Dunbar's interpretation of the College emblem, a ‘horn and alpha within omega symbolism'. This referred to the College motto “In my end is my beginning”. \\n\\nDunbar, who was a Christian Scientist, continued to receive commissions for portraiture and landscape painting up to her sudden death at age 54, which occurred while she was out strolling with her husband on the North Downs combe below their home in Hastingleigh, Kent. Roger Folley died in 2008 at age 95, after a short illness.\\n\\nEvelyn Dunbar’s paintings, drawings and other artwork are held by The Imperial War Museum, Tate Britain, Arts Council of Great Britain, Cambridgeshire County Council, UK Government Art Collection, Wye Agricultural College, Kent (now merged into Imperial College London), Manchester Art Gallery, Oxford Brookes University, the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth, the Tullie House Museum as well as by private individuals in Britain and abroad.\\n\\nAn Evelyn Dunbar retrospective at the St. Barbe Museum and Art Gallery in Lymington, Hampshire in November 2006 coincided with the publication of Dr. Gill Clarke's \"Evelyn Dunbar - War & Country\". Dr. Gill Clarke further curated a second exhibition entitled \"The Women's Land Army - A Portrait\" complementing a new publication and exhibition of the same name at the St. Barbe Museum in November 2008.\\n\\n"}

Its main rivals were the widely read Dublin Evening Mail and the less widely read Evening Herald. \\n\\nThe Evening Telegraph was launched in 1871 by a former Irish nationalist Lord Mayor of Dublin Edmund Dwyer Gray. The newspaper was unavowedly Irish nationalist in its politics. It was originally a weekly newspaper but soon became daily (except Sundays). \\n\\nIt was particularly famous for the attention it paid to covering social events, and for its use of drawings as illustrations. \\n\\nThe paper was published on distinctive pink newspaper, which marked it out visually from the buff (brownish-yellow) paper colour used by one of its Dublin rivals, the Dublin Evening Mail. \\n\\nLeopold Bloom sells advertising for the Evening Telegraph in James Joyce's famous novel Ulysses.\\n\\nThe paper was published between 1871 and 1924. It closed in the same year as the main daily Nationalist newspaper, the Freeman's Journal. It is unclear whether the elimination of the Irish Parliamentary Party in the 1918 general election, and the achievement of dominion status as opposed to the IPP’s desired home rule, undermined the need for the old Nationalist newspapers attached to a political order that had been swept away between 1916 and 1922. \\n\\n"}

In response, SACS issued a position statement that urged “its member institutions to review their transfer policies and procedures with a view toward making transfer of credit easier for students while continuing to honor their obligation to maintain academic quality and integrity.” Also, the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, the American Council on Education, and CHEA have endorsed the principle that transfer of credit should not be based solely on an institution's accreditation.\\n\\nEverest University participates in Florida’s optional credit transfer program, the Florida Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). SCNS was established to facilitate the transfer of students and credits between Florida's public postsecondary educational institutions and participating nonpublic educational institutions, such as Everest University. “Courses that have the same academic content and are taught by faculty with comparable credentials are given the same prefix and number, and are considered equivalent courses. Equivalent courses are guaranteed to transfer to any other institution participating in SCNS, and the credit awarded for these equivalent courses will satisfy the receiving institution’s institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students.” All Florida public universities and colleges participate in SCNS as well as numerous career/technical education centers and nonpublic institutions, such as Everest University. On August 24, 2010, Everest University had 709 courses listed on SCNS.\\n\\nThe unfamiliarity of for-profit institutions has stirred debate between traditional schools and for-profits. Everest (formally FMU) is a career-college that focuses on career-specific training and measures performance by job graduation and job placement rates and offers alternative methods to adult education (including night, weekend and online courses) for working adults.\\n\\nIn 2006, an arbitration process ruled in favor of FMU/Everest and a lawsuit regarding transfer of credits dating to 2004 was dismissed.\\n\\nIn August 2007, an investigation of company practices was closed by the State of Florida with no fines, penalties, or finding of wrongdoing. The investigation inquired into FMU's \"advertising, marketing and business practices related to the sale of educational services to Florida Residents.\" The resulting \"Assurance of Voluntary Compliance\" between FMU and the Forida Office of the Attorney General indicated that FMU would pay $99,900 to the Office of the Attorney General for its investigation and in contributions to various consumer education purposes. It indicated that FMU would \"modify\" its pre-enrollment documents to include \"Clear and Conspicuous\" language regarding credit transfer, its refund policy, and its tuition costs, among other stipulations that, in part, serve to \"better train\" its teaching personnel to meet certain student needs. The Assurance of Voluntary Compliance found that FMU/Everest participates in the Florida Statewide Course Numbering System to facilitate the transfer of eligible credits to other institutions.\\n\\nEverest University-Jacksonville and Everest University-Lakeland are members of SOC (Servicemembers Opportunity College) Consortium. SOC Consortium colleges and universities are dedicated to helping servicemembers and their families get college degrees. Military students can take courses in their off-duty hours at or near military installations in the United States, overseas, and on U.S. Navy ships.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Everglades National Park", "body": "Everglades National Park is a national park in the U.S. state of Florida that protects the southern 25 percent of the original Everglades. It is the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States, and is visited on average by one million people each year. It is the third-largest national park in the lower 48 states after Death Valley and Yellowstone. It has been declared an International Biosphere Reserve, a World Heritage Site, and a Wetland of International Importance, only one of three locations in the world to appear on all three lists. \\n\\nUnlike most U.S. national parks, Everglades National Park was created to protect a fragile ecosystem instead of safeguarding a unique geographic feature. The Everglades are wetlands created by a slow-moving river originating in Lake Okeechobee, fed by the Kissimmee River, and flowing southwest at about  per day into Florida Bay. The park protects an interconnected network of marshland and forest ecosystems that are maintained by natural forces. Thirty-six species designated as threatened or protected live in the park, including the Florida panther, the American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee. The park protects the largest U.S. wilderness area east of the Mississippi River, is the most significant breeding ground for tropical wading bird in North America, and contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the western hemisphere. More than 350 species of birds, 300 species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40 species of mammals, and 50 species of reptiles live within Everglades National Park. All of South Florida's fresh water, which is stored in the Biscayne Aquifer, is recharged in the park. \\n\\nAlthough humans have lived in the Everglades for thousands of years, not until 1882 did the region begin to be drained for agricultural or residential use. In the 20th century the natural water flow from Lake Okeechobee was controlled and diverted to the explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934 to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades and dedicated in 1947, the same year massive canal-building projects across South Florida began to divert water away from the park. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and the repair and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nEverglades National Park covers , throughout Dade, Broward, Monroe, and Collier counties in Florida. The elevation typically ranges from 0 to  above sea level, but a Native American-built shell mound on the Gulf Coast rises  above sea level. \\n\\nThe terrain of South Florida is relatively and consistently flat. Although rock formations are not a central draw to Everglades National Park, the limestone that underlies the Everglades is integral to the formation of the diverse ecosystems within the park. Florida was once part of the African portion of the supercontinent Gondwana. After it separated, conditions allowed a shallow marine environment to deposit calcium carbonate in sand, shells, and coral to be converted into limestone. Tiny bits of shell, sand, and bryozoan compressed over multiple layers forming unique structures in the limestone called ooids which created porous and permeable conditions to hold water.\\n\\nThe Florida peninsula appeared above sea level between 100,000 and 15,000 years ago. As sea levels at the end of the Wisconsin ice age rose, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. Although the limestone shelf appears to be flat, there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and amount of water present.\\n\\nUnlike in the northern portion of Florida, no underground spring feed water into the Everglades system. An underground reservoir called the Floridan Aquifer lies about  below the surface of South Florida. However, the Everglades has an immense capacity for water storage, due to the sponge-like permeable limestone underneath the exposed land. Most of the water arrives in the form of rainfall, and a significant amount is stored in the limestone. Water evaporating from the Everglades becomes rain over metropolitan areas, providing the fresh water supply for the region. Water also flows into the park after falling as rain on Lake Okeechobee and the Kissimmee River, to appear in the Everglades days later. Water overflows Lake Okeechobee into a river 40 to  wide, which moves almost imperceptibly. \\n\\nMost of the Everglades see only two seasons: wet and dry. The park's dry season lasts from December to April, when temperatures vary from 53 °F (12 °C) to 77 °F (25 °C) and humidity is low. Since water levels are low at that time, animals congregate at central water locations, providing popular opportunities for viewing the wildlife. During the wet season, from May to November, temperatures are consistently above 90 °F (33 °C) and humidity over 90 percent. Storms can drop 10 to  of rain at a time, providing half the year's average of 60 inches (152 cm) of rainfall in just two months.\\n\\nAt the turn of the 20th century common concepts of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading the federal government and the people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service currently recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size due to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nFreshwater slough are perhaps the most common ecosystem associated with Everglades National Park. These drainage channels are characterized by low-lying areas covered in fresh water, flowing at an almost imperceptible  per day. Shark River Slough and Taylor Slough are significant features of the park. Sawgrass growing to a length of  or more, and broad-leafed marsh plants, are so prominent in this region that they gave the Everglades its nickname \"River of Grass\". Excellent feeding locations for birds, sloughs in the Everglades attract a great variety of waders such as heron, egret, roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), ibis and brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), as well as limpkins (Aramus guarauna) and snail kites that eat apple snail, which in turn feed on the sawgrass. The sloughs' availability of fish, amphibians, and young birds attract a variety of freshwater turtles, alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), water moccasins (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti), and eastern diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus adamanteus).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nFreshwater marl prairies are similar to sloughs, but lack the slow movement of water; instead, water seeps through a calcitic mud called marl. Algae and other microscopic organisms form periphyton, which attaches to limestone. When it dries it turns into a gray mud. Sawgrass and other water plants grow shorter in freshwater marl than they do in peat, the other type of soil in the Everglades which is found where water remains present longer throughout the year. Marl prairies are usually under water from three to seven months of the year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged for more than nine months and sometimes remain under water from one year to the next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating a monoculture. Other grasses, such as muhly grass (Muhlenbergia filipes) and broad-leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Animals living in the freshwater sloughs also inhabit in marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry in some parts of the year; alligators play a vital role in maintaining life in remote parts of the Everglades by burrowing in the mud during the dry season, and creating pools of water where fish and amphibians survive from one year to the next. Alligator holes also attract other animals who congregate to feed on smaller prey. When the region floods again during the wet season, the fish and amphibians who were sustained in the alligator holes then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.\\n\\nHammocks are often the only dry land within the park. They rise several inches above the grass-covered river, and are dominated by diverse plant life consisting of subtropical and tropical trees, such as large southern live oaks (Quercus virginiana). Trees often form canopies under which animals thrive amongst scrub bushes of wild coffee (Psychotria), white indigoberry (Randia aculeata), poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum) and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). The park features thousands of these tree islands amid sloughs—which often form the shape of a teardrop when seen from above (see park map) because of the slowly moving water around them—but they can also be found in pineland and mangroves. Trees in the Everglades, including wild tamarind (Lysiloma latisiliquum) and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba), rarely grow higher than  due to wind, cold weather, and lightning strikes.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe plant growth around the hammock base is nearly impenetrable; however, beneath the canopy hammocks are an ideal habitat for animals. Reptiles (such as various species of snake and anole) and amphibians (such as the American green tree frog (Hyla cinerea), find their homes in the hardwood hammocks. Birds such as barred owls (Strix varia), woodpecker, northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and southern bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nest in hammock trees. Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Everglades mink (Neovison vison), marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the rare, critically endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi).\\n\\nDade County was once covered in  of pine rockland forests, but most of it was harvested by the lumber industry. Pineland ecosystems (or pine rocklands) are characterized by shallow, dry sandy loam over a limestone substrate covered almost exclusively by slash pines (Pinus elliottii var. densa). Trees in this ecosystem grow in solution holes, where the soft limestone has worn away and filled with soil, allowing plants to take hold. Pinelands require regular maintenance by fire to ensure their existence. South Florida slash pines are uniquely adapted to promote fire by dropping a large amount of dried pine needles and shedding dry bark. Pine cones require heat from fires to open, allowing seeds to disperse and take hold. The trunks and roots of slash pines, however, are resistant to fire. Prescribed burn in these areas take place every three to seven years; without regular fires, hardwood trees begin to grow in this region and pinelands become recategorized as mixed swamp forests. Most plants in the area bloom about 16 weeks after a fire. Nearly all pinelands have an understory of palm shrubs, and a diverse ground covering of wild herbs.\\n\\nPine rocklands are considered one of the most threatened habitats in Florida; less than  of pineland exist outside the park. Within the park,  of pineland are protected. A variety of animal species meet their needs for food, shelter, nesting, and rooking in pine rocklands. Woodpeckers, eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus), grackle, and northern mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos) are commonly found in pinelands. Black bears and Florida panthers also live in this habitat.\\n\\nCypress trees are conifer that are adapted to live in standing fresh water. They grow in compact structures called cypress domes and in long strands over limestone. Water levels may fluctuate dramatically around cypress domes and strands, so cypresses develop \"knees\" that protrude from the water at high levels to provide oxygen for the root systems. Dwarf cypress trees grow in drier areas with poorer soil. Epiphyte, such as bromeliads, Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), orchids and fern grow on the branches and trunks of cypress trees. Everglades National Park features twenty-five species of orchids. Tall cypress trees provide excellent nesting areas for birds including wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), ibis, herons, egrets, anhingas (Anhinga anhinga), and belted kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon). Mammals in cypress regions include white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, opossums, skunks, swamp rabbits, river otters (Lontra canadensis), and bobcats, as well as small rodents.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nMangrove trees cover the coastlines of South Florida, sometimes growing inland depending on the amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During dryer years when less fresh water flows to the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world. \\n\\nWithin the Florida mangrove systems live 220 species of fish, and a variety of crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusk, and other invertebrate, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use mangroves as nurseries and food stores, including pelican, grebe, tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), gull, tern, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like mangrove cuckoos (Coccyzus minor), yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia), and white-crowned pigeons (Patagioenas leucocephala). The mangroves also support 24 species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18 species of mammals, including the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).\\n\\nCoastal lowlands, or wet prairies, are salt water marshes that absorb marine water when it gets high or fresh water when rains are heavy. Floods occur during hurricane and tropical storm surge when ocean water can rise several feet over the land. Heavy wet seasons also cause floods when rain from the north flows into the Everglades. Few trees can survive in the conditions of this region, but plants—succulent like saltwort and glasswort—tolerate salt, brackish water, and desert conditions. Animal life in this zone is dependent upon the amount of water present, but commonly found animals include Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), Everglades snail kites (Rostrhamus sociabilis), wood storks (Mycteria americana), eastern indigo snakes (Drymarchon corais couperi), and small mammals such as rats, mice, and rabbits.\\n\\nThe largest body of water within the park is Florida Bay, which extends from the mangrove swamps of the mainland's southern tip to the Florida Keys. Over  of marine ecosystem lies in this range. Coral, sponge, and seagrass serve as shelter and food for crustacean and mollusk, which in turn are the primary food source for larger marine animals. Sharks, stingray, and barracuda also live in this ecosystem, as do larger species of fish that attract sport fishing. Pelicans, shorebird, terns, and black skimmers (Rynchops niger) are among the birds frequenting park shorelines.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nHumans likely first inhabited the South Florida region 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. Two tribes of Native Americans developed on the peninsula's southern tip: the Tequesta lived on the eastern side and the Calusa, greater in numbers, on the western side. The Everglades served as a natural boundary between them. The Tequesta lived in a single large community near the mouth of the Miami River, while the Calusa lived in 30 villages. Both groups traveled through the Everglades, but rarely lived within them, remaining mostly along the coast.\\n\\nThe diets of both groups consisted mostly of shellfish and fish, small mammals, game, and wild plants. Having access only to soft limestone, most of the tools fashioned by Native Americans in the region were made of shell, bone, wood, and animal teeth; shark teeth were used as cutting blades, and sharpened reeds became arrows and spears. Shell mound still exist today within the park, giving archaeologist and anthropologist evidence of the raw materials available to the indigenous people for tool construction. Spanish explorers estimated the number of Tequesta at first contact to be around 800, and Calusa at 2,000, although the National Park Service reports there were probably about 20,000 natives living in or near the Everglades when the Spanish established contact in the late 16th century. The Calusa society was more advanced, as they lived in social strata, and were able to create canal, earthwork, and shellwork. The Calusa were also able to resist Spanish attempts at conquest.\\n\\nAlthough the Spanish had contact with these societies, they established missions further north, near Lake Okeechobee. In the 18th century, invading Creek incorporated the dwindling numbers of the Tequesta into their own. Neither the Tequesta nor Calusa tribe existed by 1800. Disease, warfare, and capture for slavery were the probably reasons for the eradication of both groups. The only evidence of their existence within the park boundaries is a series of shell mounds that were built by the Calusa.\\n\\nIn the early 19th century, Creeks, escaped African slaves, and other Indians from northern Florida displaced by the Creek War formed the area's Seminole nation. After the end of the Seminole Wars in 1842, the Seminoles faced relocation to Indian territory near Oklahoma. A few hundred Seminole hunters and scouts settled within what is today Big Cypress National Preserve, to escape the emigration to the west. From 1859 to about 1930, the Seminoles and Miccosukee, a similar but linguistically unique tribe, lived in relative isolation, making their living by trading. In 1928, surveying and construction began on the Tamiami Trail, along the northern border of Everglades National Park. The road not only bisected the Everglades but also introduced a steady, if small, traffic of white settlers into the Everglades.\\n\\nSome members of the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes continue to live within park boundaries. Management of the park includes approval of new policies and procedures by tribal representatives \"in such a manner that they do not conflict with the park purpose\".\\n\\nFollowing the end of the Seminole Wars, Americans began settling at isolated points along the coast in what is now the park, from the Ten Thousand Islands to Cape Sable. Communities developed on the two largest pieces of dry ground in the area, on Chokoloskee Island and at Flamingo on Cape Sable, both of which established post offices in the early 1890s. Chokoloskee Island is a shell mound, a midden built roughly 20 feet (6 m) high over thousands of years of occupation by the Calusa. The settlements in Chokoloskee and Flamingo served as trading centers for small populations of farmers, fishermen and charcoal burners settled in the Ten Thousand Islands. Both settlements and the more isolated homesteads could only be reached by boat until well into the 20th century. Everglades City, on the mainland near Chokoloskee, enjoyed a brief period of prosperity when, beginning in 1920, it served as the headquarters for construction of the Tamiami Trail. A dirt road from Florida City reached Flamingo in 1922, while a causeway finally connected Chokoloskee to the mainland's Everglades City in 1956. After the park was established, residents of Flamingo were bought out, and the site was incorporated into the park as a visitor center.\\n\\nthumb \\n\\nSeveral attempts were made to drain and develop the Everglades in the 1880s. The first canals built in the Everglades did little harm to the ecosystem, as they were unable to drain much of it. However, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward based the majority of his 1904 campaign for governor on how drainage would create \"The Empire of the Everglades\". Broward ordered the drainage that took place between 1905 and 1910, and it was successful enough that land developers sold tracts for $30 an acre, settling the town of Davie, and developing regions in Lee and Dade counties. The canals also cleared water that made way for agricultural fields growing sugarcane.\\n\\nThe 1920s saw a population boom in South Florida that created a demand for land described by author Michael Grunwald as \"insanity\". Land was sold before any homes or structures were built on it, and in some cases before any plans for construction were in place. New landowners, eager to make good on their investments, hastily constructed homes and small towns on recently drained land. Mangrove trees on the coasts were taken down for better views and replaced with shallow rooted palm trees. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction on larger canals to control the rising waters in the Everglades. Nevertheless, Lake Okeechobee continued to rise and fall, the region was covered with rain, and city planners continued to battle the water. The 1926 Miami Hurricane caused Lake Okeechobee levee to fail; hundreds of people who had just moved in south of the lake drowned. Two years later, the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane claimed 2,500 lives when Lake Okeechobee once again surged over its levees. Politicians who declared the Everglades uninhabitable were silenced when a four-story wall, named the Herbert Hoover Dike, was built around Lake Okeechobee. This wall effectively cut off the water source from the Everglades.\\n\\nFollowing the wall's construction, South Florida endured a drought severe enough to cause massive wildfires in 1939. The influx of humans had a detrimental effect on the plants and animals of the region when melaleuca trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia) were introduced to help with drainage, along with Australian pine brought in by developers as windbreak. The region's timber was devastated for lumber supplies. Alligators, birds, frogs, and fish were hunted on a massive scale. Entire rookeries of wading birds were shot to collect their plumes, which were used in women's hats in the early 20th century. However, the largest impact people had on the region was the diversion of water away from the Everglades. Canals were deepened and widened, and water levels fell dramatically, causing chaos in food web. Salt water replaced fresh water in the canals, and by 1997 scientists noticed that salt water was seeping into the Biscayne Aquifer, South Florida's water source. \\n\\nIn the 1940s, a freelance writer and former reporter for The Miami Herald named Marjory Stoneman Douglas began to research the Everglades for an assignment about the Miami River. She studied the land and water for five years, and published The Everglades: River of Grass in 1947, describing the area in great detail, including a chapter on its disappearance. She wrote: \"What had been a river of grass and sweet water that had given meaning and life and uniqueness to this enormous geography through centuries in which man had no place here was made, in one chaotic gesture of greed and ignorance and folly, a river of fire.\" The book has sold 500,000 copies since its publication, and Douglas' continued dedication to ecology conservation earned her the nicknames \"Grand Dame of the Everglades\", \"Grandmother of the Everglades\" and \"the anti-Christ\" for her singular focus at the expense of some political interests. She founded and served as president for an organization called Friends of the Everglades, initially intended to protest the construction of a proposed Big Cypress jetport in 1968. Successful in that confrontation, the organization has grown to over 4,000 members, committed to the preservation of the Everglades. She wrote and spoke about the importance of the Everglades until her death at age 108 in 1998.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nFloridians hoping to preserve at least part of the Everglades began to express their concern over diminishing resources in the early 20th century. Royal Palm State Park was created in 1916; it included several trails and a visitor's center several miles from Homestead. Miami-based naturalists first proposed that the area become a national park in 1923. Five years later, the Florida state legislature established the Tropical Everglades National Park Commission to study the formation of a protected area. The commission was led by a land developer turned conservationist named Ernest F. Coe, who was eventually nicknamed Father of Everglades National Park. Coe's original plan for the park included more than  including Key Largo and Big Cypress, and his unwillingness to compromise almost prevented the park's creation. Various other interests, including land developers and sport hunters, demanded some of the land be trimmed.\\n\\nThe commission was also tasked with proposing a method to raise the money to purchase the land. The search coincided with the arrival of the Great Depression in the United States, and money for land purchase was scarce. The U.S. House of Representatives authorized the creation of the new national park on May 30, 1934, but it passed only with a rider that ensured no money would be allotted to the project for at least five years. Coe's passion and U.S. Senator Spessard Holland's politicking helped to fully establish the park, after Holland was able to negotiate  of the park, leaving out Big Cypress, Key Largo, the Turner River area, and a  tract of land called \"The Hole in the Donut\" that was too highly valued for agriculture. Miami Herald editor John Pennekamp was instrumental in pushing the Florida Legislature to raise $2 million to purchase the private land inside the park boundaries. It was dedicated by President Harry Truman on December 6, 1947, one month after Douglas' book was released. In the same year, several tropical storms struck South Florida, prompting the construction of  of canals, sending water unwanted by farmers and residents to the ocean. \\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project (C&SF) was authorized by Congress to construct more than a thousand miles of canals and flood control structures across South Florida. The C&SF, run by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, established an agricultural area directly south of Lake Okeechobee, and three water conservation areas, all bordered by canals that diverted excess water either to urban areas or into the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico or Florida Bay. South of these manmade regions was Everglades National Park, which had been effectively cut off from its water supply. By the 1960s, the park was visibly suffering. Although the C&SF was directed to provide enough water to sustain the park, it did not follow through. A proposed airport that would have dire environment effects on Everglades National Park became the center of a battle that helped to initiate the environmental movement into local and national politics. The airport proposal was eventually abandoned and in 1972 a bill was introduced to curb development in South Florida and ensure the national park would receive the amount of water it needed. Efforts turned to repairing the damage wrought by decades of mismanagement: the Army Corps of Engineers changed its focus in 1990 from constructing dams and canals to constructing \"purely environmental projects\". \\n\\nRegions originally included in Ernest Coe's vision for a national park were slowly added over the years to the park or incorporated into other protected areas: Biscayne National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park on Key Largo, Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary were all protected after the park's opening in 1947. Everglades National Park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve on October 26, 1976. On November 10, 1978, most of the park was declared a wilderness area. Wilderness designations covered  in 2003—about 86 percent of the park. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on October 24, 1979 and as a Wetland of International Importance on June 4, 1987. \\n\\nthumb\\n\\nPresident George H. W. Bush signed the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act on December 13, 1989 that added  to the eastern side of the park, closed the park to airboat, directed the Department of the Army to restore water to improve the ecosystems within Everglades National Park, and \"Direct(ed) the Secretary of the Interior to manage the Park in order to maintain the natural abundance, diversity, and ecological integrity of native plants and animals, as well as the behavior of native animals, as part of their ecosystem.\" Bush remarked in his statement when signing the act, \"Through this legislation that river of grass may now be restored to its natural flow of water\". In 1993, however, the park was placed on the List of World Heritage Sites in danger.\\n\\nIn 2000, Congress approved a federal effort to restore the Everglades, named the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), with the objectives of \"restoration, preservation and protection of the south Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region\", and claiming to be the largest environmental restoration in history. It was a controversial plan; detractors worried that it \"relies on uncertain technologies, overlooks water quality, subsidizes damaging growth and delays its environmental benefits\". Supporters of the plan included the National Audubon Society, who was accused by Friends of the Everglades and the Biodiversity Legal Foundation of prioritizing agricultural and business interests.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nCERP projects are designed to capture 1.7 billion gallons (6.4 billion l) of fresh water every day, store it in underground reservoirs and release the water to areas within 16 counties in South Florida. Approximately  of man-made wetlands are to be constructed to confine contaminated water before it is released to the Everglades, and  of canals that divert water away from the Everglades are to be destroyed. During the first five years of implementation, CERP was responsible for the purchase of  of land at a cost of $1 billion. The plan aims to spend $10.5 billion over 30 years, combining 50 different projects and giving them 5-year timelines. The State of Florida has invested more than $2 billion into restoring the Everglades, but the funds have not been matched by the U.S. government. As of June 2008, the U.S. government has spent only $400 million of the $7.8 billion legislated. Initiatives that could aid Everglades restoration include the U.S. Sugar Land Corp transaction, the C-111 spreader canal and the Tamiami Trail bridging. These projects are supported by groups such as the Everglades Foundation, whose mission is to aid in the efforts of saving America’s Everglades for future generations. In spite of this, Everglades National Park was removed in 2007 from the List of World Heritage Sites in danger. However, it was listed again on the List of the World Heritage Sites in Danger in 2010. The National Research Council reported in September 2008 that no CERP projects had been completed, and the lack of progress on water deliveries to Everglades National Park \"is one of the most discouraging stories in Everglades restoration\".\\n\\nEverglades National Park was directly hit by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita in 2005. Such storms are a natural part of the park's ecosystem; 1960's Hurricane Donna left nothing in the mangroves but \"standing dead snags\" several miles wide, but 30 years later the area had completely recovered. Predictably, what suffered the most in the park from the 2005 hurricanes were manmade structures. The visitors center and lodge at Flamingo were damaged by  winds and an  storm surge. The lodge had been functioning for 50 years when it was irreparably damaged and eventually torn down in 2009; nothing is slated to replace it.\\n\\nEverglades National Park reported in 2005 a budget of over $28 million. Of that, $14.8 million is granted from the National Park Service, and $13.5 million from various sources including CERP, donations, and other grants. The entry fee for vehicles in 2006 ranged from $10 to $200 for bus tours. Of the nearly one million visitors to Everglades National Park in 2006, more than 38,000 were overnight campers, paying $16 a night or $10 a night for backcountry permits. Visitors spent $2.6 million within the park and $48 million in local economies. More than 900 jobs were sustained or created within or by the park, and the park added value of $35 million to local economies.\\n\\nThe busiest season for visitors is from December to March, when temperatures are lowest and mosquitoes are least active. The park features four visitor centers: on the Tamiami Trail (part of U.S. Route 41) directly west of Miami is the Shark Valley Visitor Center. A fifteen-mile (24 km) round trip path leads from this center to a two-story observation tower. Tram tours are available during the busy season. Closest to Homestead on State Road 9336 is the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, where a  road begins, winding through pine rockland, cypress, freshwater marl prairie, coastal prairie, and mangrove ecosystems. Various hiking trails are accessible from the road, which runs to the Flamingo Visitor Center and marina, open and staffed during the busier time of the year. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center is closest to Everglades City on State Road 29 along the west coast. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center gives canoers access to the Wilderness Waterway, a 99-mile (160 km) canoe trail that extends to the Flamingo Visitor Center. The western coast of the park and the Ten Thousand Islands and the various key islands in Florida Bay are accessible only by boat.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nSeveral walking trails in the park vary in hiking difficulty on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead, Florida and its accessibility make it one of the most visited sites in the park. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is another self-guided trail, half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45 km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nCamping sites are available year-round in Everglades National Park. Frontcountry camping, with some services, is available at Long Pine Key, close to the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, where 108 sites are accessible by car. Near Flamingo 234 campsites with some services are also available. Recreational vehicle camping is available at these sites, although not with all necessary services. Backcountry permits are required for campsites along the Wilderness Waterway, Gulf Coast sites, and sites in the various keys. Several backcountry sites are chickee; others are beach and ground sites.\\n\\nLow-powered motorboats are allowed in the park, although the majority of salt water areas are no-wake zone to protect manatees from harm. Jet ski, airboats, and other motorized personal watercraft are prohibited. However, many trails allow kayaks and canoes. A state license is required for fishing, and although fresh water licenses are not sold in the park, a salt water license may be available. Swimming is not recommended within the park boundaries; water moccasins, snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), alligators and crocodiles thrive in fresh water. Sharks, barracuda, and sharp dangerous coral are plentiful in salt water. Visibility is low in both kinds.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nLess than 50 percent of the Everglades which existed prior to drainage attempts remains intact today. Populations of wading birds dwindled 90 percent from their original numbers between the 1940s and 2000s. The diversion of water to South Florida's still-growing metropolitan areas is the Everglades National Park's number one threat. In the 1950s and 1960s,  of canals and levees, 150 gates and spillways, and 16 pumping stations were constructed to direct water toward cities and away from the Everglades. Low levels of water leave fish vulnerable to reptiles and birds, and as sawgrass dries it can burn or die off, which in turn kills apple snails and other animals that wading birds feed upon. Populations of birds fluctuate; in 2009, the South Florida Water Management District claimed wading birds across South Florida increased by 335%. However, following three years of higher numbers, The Miami Herald reported the same year that populations of wading birds within the park decreased by 29%. \\n\\nThe west coast of Florida relies on desalinization for its fresh water; the quantity demanded is too great for the land to provide. Nitrate in the underground water system and high levels of mercury also impact the quality of fresh water the park receives. In 1998 a Florida panther was found dead in Shark Water Slough, with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Increased occurrences of algae bloom and red tide in Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay have been traced to the amounts of controlled water released from Lake Okeechobee. The brochure given to all visitors at Everglades National Park includes a statement that reads, \"Freshwater flowing into the park is engineered. With the help of pumps, floodgates, and retention ponds along the park's boundary, the Everglades is presently on life support, alive but diminished.\"\\n\\nA series of levees on the park's eastern border marks the line between urban and protected areas, but development into these areas threatens the park system. Florida still attracts nearly a thousand new residents every day, and building residential, commercial and industrial zones near Everglades National Park stresses the water balance and ecosystems within the park. On the park's western border, Ft. Myers, Naples and Cape Coral are growing, but no system of levees exists to mark that border. National Geographic rated both Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve the lowest-scoring parks in North America, at 32 out of 100. Their scoring system rated 55 parks in terms of sustainable tourism, destination quality, and park management. The experts who compiled the results justified the score by stating: \"Encroachment by housing and retail development has thrown the precious ecosystem into a tailspin, and if humankind doesn't back off, there will be nothing left of one of this country's most amazing treasures\".\\n\\nthumb \\n\\nThirty-six federally protected animals live in the park, some of which face grave concern for survival. The American crocodile is found only in South Florida within the United States. Overhunted for their hides, today they are protected from hunting, but are still threatened due to habitat destruction, and injury from cars when they cross roads to reach waterways. Roughly 50 nests exist in Everglades and Biscayne National Park, and about 1,000 crocodiles currently live in Florida. Numbers of crocodiles in South Florida have risen recently along with the numbers of alligators, and crocodiles were reclassified as \"threatened\" in the United States in 2007. \\n\\nThe Florida panther is one of the most endangered mammals on earth, and they live primarily in the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp. About 50 live in the wild. The biggest threats to the panther include habitat destruction from human development, vehicle collisions, inbreeding due to a limited gene pool, parasites, diseases, and mercury poisoning. \\n\\nFour species of sea turtles including the Atlantic green sea turtle, Atlantic hawksbill, Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered, and the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Although numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace, females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals. \\n\\nTwo species of birds in the park are most in danger of disappearing. The Cape Sable seaside sparrow is restricted to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 there were 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows reported in its boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred. \\n\\nThe West Indian manatee has recently been upgraded from endangered to threatened. Collisions with boats and habitat loss are still its biggest threats.\\n\\nFire naturally occurs after lightning storms, but takes its heaviest toll when water levels are low. Hardwood hammock and cypress trees are susceptible to heavy damage due to fire, and some may take decades to grow back. Peat built up over centuries in the marsh can cause fires to burn deep scars in the soil. In 2007, Fred Sklar of the South Florida Water Management District said: \"An extreme drought can be viewed almost as catastrophic as a volcano. It can reshape the entire landscape. It can take 1,000 years to produce two inches of peat, and you can lose those couple of inches in a week.\"\\n\\nRising sea levels caused by global warming are another threat to the future of the park. Since 1932, ocean levels at Key West have steadily risen over , which could have disastrous consequences for land so close to the ocean. It is estimated that within 500 years freshwater habitats in the Everglades National Park will be obliterated by salt water, leaving only the northern-most portion of the Everglades. Cost estimates for raising or replacing the Tamiami Trail and Alligator Alley with bridges are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nAnother growing threat in recent years is the introduction of non-native species into the park. The melaleuca tree causes the most destruction of any plant species, taking large amounts of water and leaving marsh areas desiccated. Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) has invaded as well, competing with native plants that serve as food for animals, and is difficult to eradicate. The Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus) is one of the most formidable animal species. These snakes are capable of growing up to  in length, and park visitors have seen them struggling with alligators. As Kenneth Krysko from the Florida Museum of Natural History puts it, \"These [snakes] are now the huge apex predator in the Everglades. There's nothing bigger.\" The first python was found in 1979, with none seen until 1995; between 2001 and 2005, however, more than 230 pythons have been discovered within the park boundaries, and they have begun reproducing on their own. When found, pythons are immediately captured and removed. Park biologists say that the exotic pet trade and pet owners who release pythons into the wilderness are responsible for the existence of the snakes within the Everglades. Skip Snow, wildlife biologist at Everglades National Park, said, \"All of the Burmese pythons that we see in the park are a product of the international pet trade.\" Coyotes (Canis latrans) have also been spotted in the park, as well as in Big Cypress National Preserve. Park managers have attributed the lower numbers of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in both parks to the arrival of coyotes. Numerous exotic bird species are often seen in or on the fringes of the park. Some established species include the common mynah (Acridotheres tristis) and various parrot species, while newcomers such as the sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus) show signs of increasing numbers.\\n\\n"}

They were runners up to Arsenal in the 2009/10 Premier League National Division season. They have won the title once in 1998 and the FA Cup on two occasions in 1989 and 2010. On February 28, 2008 Everton beat Arsenal 1–0 to lift the 2008 Premier League Cup.\\n\\nThe ladies play at The Arriva Stadium in Crosby, Merseyside which is the home of local men's amateur side Marine F.C.. They are managed by Mo Marley.\\n\\nThe club started life as Hoylake WFC in 1983. They merged with Dolphins YC to become Leasowe, adding Pacific to their title in a sponsorship deal. In 1987/88 they came to prominence winning the North-West League and reaching the 1988 FA Women's Cup final, losing to Doncaster Belles 3–2. However they were back the following year and this time they beat Fulham, this time on the right end of a 3–2 scoreline. By 1991/92 they had won their regional league five years running, and when a regular national competition started the next season they were admitted to division one north and promptly finished top to join the FA Women's Premier League.\\n\\nIn 1995 the club became known as Everton Ladies and continued to make their mark. In 1997 they reached the final of the Premier League Cup only to lose to Millwall Lionesses 1–2. The following year, however, Everton Ladies were crowned National Premier League Champions which is their biggest success to date.\\n\\nIn 1999 the club again lost in the League Cup final, 1–3 to Arsenal Ladies, and in 2005 reached the FA Women's Cup final only to lose 0–1 to Charlton Athletic after a disappointing display. Still, revenge of sorts came two years later when Everton pipped Charlton to second place in the Premier League, which as champions Arsenal had already won the European Cup meant a European debut for the Toffees in 2007/08.\\n\\nThe ladies' first foray into UEFA competition saw them win their opening game against local Lithuanian side Gintra 4–0. They won further group games against Glentoran and Zulwil without conceding and scoring 20 goals in the process. The campaign was to end in disappointment at the second group stage however. Despite beating Valur Reykjavík 3–1 in their final group game, Everton only finished third and failed to progress into the Quarter-finals amidst much controversy.\\n\\nOn May 10, 2009, Everton needed only a draw against Arsenal Ladies in the last match of the season to win the Women's Premier League for only the second time in their history, but lost 1–0 to finish runners-up on goal difference. Due to the reformatting of the European Cup into the UEFA Women's Champions League, however, they still qualified for Europe, although they had to enter at the qualifying group stages and ended up being eliminated in the Round of 32 by Norway's Roa IL. In 2010 Everton beat Arsenal 3–2 to win the Woman's FA Cup with Natasha Dowie (niece of Iain) scoring the winner deep into extra time.\\n\\nThe Club will be one of eight founding teams in the FA Women's Super League in March 2011.\\n\\nLadies\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Evolutionary linguistics", "body": "Evolutionary linguistics is the scientific study of the origins and development of language. The main challenge in this research is the lack of empirical data: spoken language leaves practically no traces. This led to an abandonment of the field for more than a century. Since the late 1980s, the field has been revived in the wake of progress made in the related fields of psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, evolutionary anthropology and cognitive science.\\n\\nAugust Schleicher (1821–1868) and his Stammbaumtheorie are often quoted as the starting point of evolutionary linguistics. Inspired by the natural sciences, especially biology, Schleicher was the first to compare languages to evolving species. He introduced the representation of language families as an evolutionary tree in articles published in 1853.Joseph Jastrow published a gestural theory of the evolution of language in the seventh volume of Science, 1886.\\n\\nThe Stammbaumtheorie proved to be very productive for comparative linguistics, but didn't solve the major problem of evolutionary linguistics: the lack of fossil records. The question of the origin of language was abandoned as unsolvable. Famously, the Société Linguistique de Paris in 1866 refused to admit any further papers on the subject.\\n\\nThe field has re-appeared in 1988 in the Linguistic Bibliography, as a subfield of psycholinguistics. In 1990, Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom published their paper \"Natural Language & Natural Selection\" which strongly argued for an adaptationist approach to language origins. Their paper is often credited with reviving the interest in evolutionary linguistics. This development was further strengthened by the establishment (in 1996) of a series of conferences on the Evolution of Language (now known as \"Evolang\"), promoting a scientific, multidisciplinary approach to the issue, and interest from major academic publishers (e.g., the Studies in the Evolution of Language series has been appearing with Oxford University Press since 2001) and scientific journals.\\n\\nEvolutionary linguistics as a field is rapidly evolving as a result of developments in neighboring disciplines. Some of these developments are:\\n\\nOne original researcher in the field is Luc Steels, head of the research units of Sony CSL in Paris and the AI Lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. He and his team are investigating ways in which artificial agents self-organize languages with natural-like properties and how meaning can co-evolve with language. Their research is based on the hypothesis that language is a complex adaptive system that emerges through adaptive interactions between agents and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of the agents. This research has been implemented in fluid construction grammar (FCG), a formalism for construction grammars that has been specially designed for the origins and evolution of language.\\n\\nThe approach of computational modeling and the use of robotic agents grounded in real life is claimed to be theory independent. It enables the researcher to find out exactly what cognitive capacities are needed for certain language phenomena to emerge. It also focuses the researcher in formulating hypotheses in a precise and exact manner, whereas theoretical models often stay very vague.\\n\\nSome linguists, such as John McWhorter, have analyzed the evolution and construction of basic communication methods such as Pidgin and Creolization.\\n\\n\"Nativist\" models of \"Universal Grammar\" are informed by linguistic universals such as the existence of pronoun and demonstrative, and the similarities in each languages process of nominalization (the process of verb becoming noun) as well as the reverse, the process of turning nouns into verbs. This is a purely descriptive approach to what we mean by \"natural language\" without attempting to address its emergence.\\n\\nThe Evolution of Language International Conferences  have been held biennially since 1996.\\n\\n"}

After meeting Dr Gerard P. Kuiper, Director of Yerkes Observatory, Wisconsin, USA, at an International Astronomical Union congress in Dublin in 1955, he was invited to join Kuiper's fledgling Lunar Project at Yerkes, to work on producing the best photographic atlas of the moon available.Russian Sputniks heralded the dawn of the Space Age in 1957, and the Lunar Project was soon in NASA's limelight. The Photographic Lunar Atlas, Orthographic Atlas of the Moon (giving accurate positions on the lunar surface), and rectified Lunar Atlas (giving astronauts-eye views of the whole lunar nearside) proved to be invaluable for the planning and operational stages of later spacecraft missions to the moon. The small Lunar Project moved to the University of Arizona in 1960 and became the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, now numbering over 300 scientists, technicians, and supporting staff.Ewen Whitaker retired from the LPL in 1978, but is still a member of the Task Group for Lunar Nomenclature of the IAU.

More recently, he chose 14 favorably located farside craters to commemorate the Challenger and Columbia astronauts who lost their lives in the two disasters. These were also adopted internationally over competing suggestions.\\n\\nWhitaker determined, with considerable confidence, the dates on which Galileo made his drawings of the Moon and composed the various relevant sections of his \"Sidereus Nuncius.\"\\n\\nHe devised a logical lettering system for designating unnamed craters on the Moon's farside.

{"title": "Excess reserves", "body": "In banking, excess reserves are bank reserves in excess of the reserve requirement set by a central bank. They are reserves of cash more than the required amounts. Holding excess reserves is generally considered costly and uneconomical as no interest is earned on the excess amount. Therefore, many banks minimize their excess reserve amounts by putting them to more productive use. \\n\\nFor banks in the U.S. Federal Reserve System, this is accomplished by making short-term (usually overnight) loans on the federal funds market to banks who may be short of their reserve requirements. However, some banks may choose to hold their excess reserves in order to facilitate upcoming transactions or meet contractual clearing balance requirements.\\n\\nThe minimum reserves and the excess reserves of private (commercial) banks are held as FRB (Federal Reserve Bank) credit in FRB accounts. The total amount of FRB credit held by private banks and the amount of FRB credit that the US government holds in its FRB account, together with all currency and vault cash form the monetary base. \\n\\nright\\n\\nOn October 3, 2008, Section 128 of the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 allowed the Fed to begin paying interest on excess reserve balances as well as required reserves. They began doing so three days later. Banks had already begun increasing the amount of their money on deposit with the Fed at the beginning of September, up from about $10 billion total at the end of August, 2008, to $880 billion by the end of the second week of January, 2009. In comparison, the increase in reserve balances reached only $65 billion after September 11, 2001 before falling back to normal levels within a month. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's original bailout proposal under which the government would acquire up to $700 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities contained no provision to begin paying interest on reserve balances.\\n\\nThe day before the change was announced, on October 7, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke expressed some confusion about it, saying, \"We're not quite sure what we have to pay in order to get the market rate, which includes some credit risk, up to the target. We're going to experiment with this and try to find what the right spread is.\" The Fed adjusted the rate on October 22, after the initial rate they set October 6 failed to keep the benchmark U.S. overnight interest rate close to their policy target, and again on November 5 for the same reason.\\n\\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that payment of interest on reserve balances would cost the American taxpayers about one tenth of the present 0.25% interest rate on $800 billion in deposits:\\n\\n0.25% simple interest on $800 billion is $2 billion, not $202 million as shown for 2009. But those expenditures pale in comparison to the lost tax revenues worldwide resulting from decreased economic activity from damage to the short-term commercial paper and associated credit markets.\\n\\nBeginning December 18, the Fed directly established interest rates paid on required reserve balances and excess balances instead of specifying them with a formula based on the target federal funds rate. On January 13, Ben Bernanke said, \"In principle, the interest rate the Fed pays on bank reserves should set a floor on the overnight interest rate, as banks should be unwilling to lend reserves at a rate lower than they can receive from the Fed. In practice, the federal funds rate has fallen somewhat below the interest rate on reserves in recent months, reflecting the very high volume of excess reserves, the inexperience of banks with the new regime, and other factors. However, as excess reserves decline, financial conditions normalize, and banks adapt to the new regime, we expect the interest rate paid on reserves to become an effective instrument for controlling the federal funds rate.\" \\n\\nAlso on January 13, Financial Week said Mr. Bernanke admitted that a huge increase in banks' excess reserves is stifling the Fed's monetary policy moves and its efforts to revive private sector lending. On January 7, 2009, the Federal Open Market Committee had decided that, \"the size of the balance sheet and level of excess reserves would need to be reduced.\" On January 15, Chicago Fed president and Federal Open Market Committee member Charles Evans said, \"once the economy recovers and financial conditions stabilize, the Fed will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. It also will have to scale back the use of emergency lending programs and reduce the size of the balance sheet and level of excess reserves. 'Some of this scaling back will occur naturally as market conditions improve on account of how these programs have been designed. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil,' he said.\"\\n\\nAt the end of January, 2009, excess reserve balances at the Fed stood at $793 billion but less than two weeks later on February 11, total reserve balances had fallen to $603 billion. On April 1, reserve balances had again increased to $806 billion, and on February 10, 2010, they stood at $1.154 trillion.\\n\\nFor the better part of 2009, throughout the great expansion in excess reserves, the potential inflationary effects have been amply debated. It is conceivable that since the Fed now pays interest on the excess reserves, that the excess reserves themselves place an effective cap on the Fed Funds before the Fed begins to lose money on interest payment mismatches between its liabilities and assets. This could curtail the Fed's ability to maintain inflation expectations well-anchored.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Excise", "body": "An excise or excise tax (sometimes called a duty of excise or a special tax) is commonly understood to refer to an inland tax on the sale, or production for sale, of specific goods; or, more narrowly, as a tax on a good produced for sale, or sold, within a country. An excise tax is one levied on specific goods or commodities produced or sold within a country, or on licenses granted for specific activities. Excises are distinguished from customs duties, which are taxes on importation. Excises are inland taxes, whereas customs duties are border taxes.\\n\\nAn excise is considered an indirect tax, meaning that the producer or seller who pays the tax to the government is expected to try to recover the tax by raising the price paid by the buyer (that is, to shift or pass on the tax). Excises are typically imposed in addition to another indirect tax such as a sales tax or VAT. In common terminology (but not necessarily in law) an excise is distinguished from a sales tax or VAT in three ways: (i) an excise typically applies to a narrower range of products; (ii) an excise is typically heavier, accounting for higher fractions (sometimes half or more) of the retail prices of the targeted products; and (iii) an excise is typically specific (so much per unit of measure; e.g. so many cents per gallon), whereas a sales tax or VAT is ad valorem, i.e. proportional to value (a percentage of the price in the case of a sales tax, or of value added in the case of a VAT).\\n\\nTypical examples of excise duties are taxes on gasoline and other fuels, and taxes on tobacco and alcohol (sometimes referred to as sin tax)\\n\\nEtymology. The word excise is derived from the Dutch accijns, which is presumed to come from the Latin accensare, meaning simply \"to tax\".\\n\\nRegulatory and legal definitions of 'excise' vary by country. For example:\\n\\nIn Australia, the meaning of \"excise\" is not merely academic, but has been the subject of numerous court cases. The High Court of Australia has repeatedly held that a tax can be an \"excise\" regardless of whether the taxed goods are of domestic or foreign origin; most recently, in Ha v New South Wales (1997), the majority of the Court endorsed the view that an excise is \"an inland tax on a step in production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods\", and took a wide view of the kind of \"step\" which, if subject to a tax, would make the tax an excise. \\n\\nIn defense of excises on strong drink, Adam Smith wrote: \"It has for some time past been the policy of Great Britain to discourage the consumption of spirituous liquors, on account of their supposed tendency to ruin the health and to corrupt the morals of the common people.\" Samuel Johnson was less flattering in his 1755 dictionary: \"EXCI'SE. n.s. ... A hateful tax levied upon commodities, and adjudged not by the common judges of property, but wretches hired by those to whom excise is paid.\"\\n\\nMonies raised through excise are often earmarked for redress of specific social costs commonly associated with the product or service being taxed. Tobacco tax revenues, for example, might be spent on government anti-smoking campaigns.\\n\\nExcise duties or taxes often serve political as well as financial ends. Public safety and health, public morals, environmental protection, and national defense are all legitimate rationales for the imposition of an excise. \\n\\nAs already mentioned, many US states tax drugs, partly in order to be able to impose heavier punishments, as the Kansas Department of Revenue states on its website:\\n\\nThere are at least two major criticisms of such legislation, however - see below.\\n\\nGambling licences are subject to excise in many countries; however, gambling itself was for a time also subject to taxation, in the form of stamp duty, whereby a revenue stamp had to be placed on the ace of spades in every pack of cards to demonstrate that the duty had been paid (hence the elaborate designs that evolved on this card in many packs as a result). Since stamp duty was originally only meant to be applied to documents (and cards were categorized as such), the fact that dice were also subject to stamp duty (and were in fact the only non-paper item listed under the 1765 Stamp Act) suggests that its implementation to cards and dice can be viewed as a type of excise duty on gambling.\\n\\nProstitution has been proposed to bear excise tax in separate bills in the Canadian Parliament (2005), and in the Nevada Legislature (2009) - proposed wordings:\\n\\nThe reasons given by Canadian MPs entering the bill covered many of the above-mentioned areas, including extra funding for police protection and better healthcare for the prostitutes - however, so did many of the counterarguments.\\n\\nExcise (often under different names, especially before the 15th century, usually consisting of several separate laws, each referring to the individual item being taxed) has been known to be applied to substances which would in today's world seem rather unusual, such as salt, paper, and coffee. In fact, salt was taxed as early as the second century, and as late as the twentieth.\\n\\nMany different reasons have been given for the taxation of such substances, but have usually - if not explicitly - revolved around the scarcity and high value of the substance, with governments clearly feeling entitled to a share of the profits traders make on these expensive items. Such would the justification of salt tax, paper excise, and even advertisement duty have been.\\n\\nWindow tax was slightly different, being brought in as a kind of alternative to income tax.\\n\\nBoth the federal and provincial governments impose excise taxes on inelastic goods such as cigarette, gasoline, alcohol, and for vehicle air conditioners. A great bulk of the retail price of cigarettes and alcohol are excise taxes. The vehicle air conditioner tax is currently set at $100 per air conditioning unit. Canada has some of the highest rates of taxes on cigarettes and alcohol in the world. These are sometimes referred to as sin tax.\\n\\nAn excise is \"a tax upon manufacture, sale or for a business license or charter,\" according to Law.com's Legal Dictionary, and is to be distinguished from a tax on real property, income or estates.\" \\n\\nIn the United States, the term \"excise\" means: (A) any tax other than a property tax or capitation (i.e., an indirect tax, or excise, in the constitutional law sense), or (B) a tax that is simply called an excise in the language of the statute imposing that tax (an excise in the statutory law sense, sometimes called a \"miscellaneous excise\"). An excise under definition (A) is not necessarily the same as an excise under definition (B), but the reverse is false.\\n\\nBoth the federal and state governments levy excise taxes on goods such as alcohol, motor fuel, and tobacco products. Even though federal excise taxes are geographically uniform, state excise taxes vary considerably. However, taxation constitutes a substantial proportion of the retail prices on alcohol and tobacco products.\\n\\nLocal governments may also impose an excise tax. For example, the city of Anchorage, Alaska charges a cigarette tax of $1.30 per pack, which is on top of the federal excise tax and the state excise tax.\\n\\nHer Majesty's Customs and Excise (HMCE) was, until April 2005, a department of the British Government in the UK. It was responsible for the collection of Value added tax (VAT), Customs Duties, Excise Duties, and other indirect tax such as Air Passenger Duty, Climate Change Levy, Insurance Premium Tax, Landfill Tax and Aggregates Levy. It was also responsible for managing the import and export of goods and services into the UK. HMCE was merged with the Inland Revenue (which was responsible for the administration and collection of direct tax) to form a new department, HM Revenue and Customs, with effect from 18 April 2003.\\n\\nThe tax was first implemented in the UK under this name in the mid-17th century.\\n\\nIn many countries, excise duty is applied by the affixation of revenue stamp to the products being sold. In the case of tobacco or alcohol, for example, the producer buys a certain bulk amount of excise stamp from the government and is then obliged to affix one to every packet of cigarettes or bottle of spirits produced.\\n\\nCritics of excise tax - such as Samuel Johnson, above - have interpreted and described excise duty as simply a government's way of levying further and unnecessary taxation on the population. The presence of \"refunds of duty\" under the UK's list of excisable activities has been used to support this argument, as it results in taxation being implemented on persons even where they would normally be exempt from paying other types of taxes – hence why they are getting the refund in the first place.\\n\\nFurthermore, excise is often somewhat similar to other taxes and sometimes doubles up with them, as in the above example, or as in the case of customs duties: since the two taxes largely apply to the same types of goods, people are forced to pay tax twice over on the same items (except in the case of duty-free) - once through excise upon purchase and a second time around through customs duties upon transportation. (A justification for this is that the country the items are being entered into is applying the customs partly for the same reasons as the original excise was charged, as it is the country of import which will suffer the ill environmental, health and social effects of, say, the cigarettes and alcohol being brought in; thus customs has many similar pros and cons as has excise.)\\n\\nThere are at least two major criticisms of excise legislation on drugs - \\n\\nkaa:Aktsizszl:Akcyza\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Exclusive Economic Zone", "body": "rightUnder the law of the sea, an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is a seazone over which a state has special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources. It stretches from the seaward edge of the state's territorial sea out to 200 nautical mile from its coast. In casual usage, the term may include the territorial sea and even the continental shelf beyond the 200 mile limit.\\n\\nthumbGenerally, a state's EEZ extends to a distance of 200 nautical mile (370 km) out from its coastal baseline. The exception to this rule occurs when EEZs would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nautical miles (740 km) apart. When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual maritime boundary. Generally, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the nearest state.\\n\\nA state's exclusive economic zone starts at the seaward edge of its territorial sea and extends outward to a distance of 200 nautical miles (370,4 km) from the baseline. Thus, the EEZ includes the contiguous zone. States also have rights to the seabed of what is called the continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles (648 km) from the coastal baseline, beyond the EEZ, but such areas are not part of their EEZ. The legal definition of the continental shelf does not directly correspond to the geological meaning of the term, as it also includes the continental rise and slope, and the entire seabed within the EEZ.\\n\\nThe idea of allotting nations EEZs to give better control of maritime affairs outside territorial limits gained acceptance in the late 20th century.\\n\\nInitially, a country's sovereign territorial waters extended 3 nautical miles or 6 km (range of cannon shot) beyond the shore. In modern times traditionally, a country's sovereign territorial waters extend to 12 nautical miles (~19 km) beyond the shore. In the early 1970s, Ecuador claimed territorial waters extending to 200 nautical miles. They began seizing U.S. tuna-fishing boats and charging heavy fines (that the U.S. government paid). Eventually the U.S. agreed to submit the issue to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. This eventually led to the recognition of 12 nautical miles as normal for the territorial sea/waters and binding international recognition of the 200 mile exclusive economic zone by the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982.\\n\\nPart V, Article 55 of the Convention states:\\n\\n250px\\n\\nThe exact extent of exclusive economic zones is a common source of conflicts between states over marine waters.\\n\\nRegions where a permanent ice shelf extends beyond the coastline are also a source of potential dispute.\\n\\nFisheries management, usually adhering to guidelines set by the FAO, provides significant practical mechanisms for the control of EEZs. Transboundary fish stocks are an important concept in this control.Transboundary stocks are fish stock that range in the EEZs of at least two countries. Straddling stock, on the other hand, range both within an EEZ as well as in the high seas, outside any EEZ. A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.\\n\\nthumb1,159,063 km\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nAustralia has the third largest exclusive economic zone, behind the United States and France, but ahead of Russia, with the total area actually exceeding that of its land territory. As per the UN convention, Australia's EEZ generally extends 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the coastline of Australia and its external territories, except where a maritime delimitation agreement exists with another state.\\n\\nThe United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf confirmed, in April 2008, Australia's rights over an additional 2.5 million square kilometres of seabed beyond the limits of Australia's EEZ. Australia also claimed, in its submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, an EEZ of 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its Antarctic Territory, but has requested it not be acted upon at the time in accordance with the spirit of cooperation embodied in the Antarctic Treaty. Nevertheless, Australia maintains the right to explore and exploit the seabed and water column within its EEZ.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nBrazil's exclusive economic zone covers 3,660,995 km.\\n\\nIn 2004, the country submitted its claims to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) to extend its maritime continental margin.\\n\\nthumbCanada is unusual in that its exclusive economic zone, covering 2,755,564 km, is slightly smaller than its territorial waters. The latter generally extend only 12 nautical miles from the shore, but also include inland marine waters such as Hudson Bay (about  across), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the internal waters of the Arctic archipelago.\\n\\nthumbChile's EEZ includes areas around the Juan Fernández Islands, the Desventuradas Islands and Easter Island.\\n\\n[[File:China Exclusive Economic Zones.png|thumb|left|300px|People's Republic of China's exclusive economic zone:877,019 km3,000,000 kmTotal:3,877,019]]\\n\\nthumbThe Kingdom of Denmark includes the two autonomous provinces of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The EEZs of the latter two do not form part of the EEZ of the European Union.\\n\\nSee also Common Fisheries Policy\\n\\nThe EEZ of the European Union is shared, so vessels or a national from one country can fish in another country's EEZ. The combined zone amounts to 25 million km, making it the largest EEZ.\\n\\nthumbDue to its numerous overseas ''départements'' and territories scattered on all oceans of the planet, France possesses the second-largest EEZ in the world, covering 11,035,000 km (4,260,000 mi), just behind the EEZ of the United States (11,351,000 km / 4,383,000 mi), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia (10,648,250 km / 4,111,312 mi). According to a different calculation cited by the Pew Research Center, the EEZ of France would be 10,084,201 km (3,893,532 mi), behind the United States (12,174,629 km / 4,700,651 mi) and Australia (10,648,250 km / 4,111,312 mi), but ahead of Russia (7,566,673 km / 2,921,508 mi).\\n\\nThe EEZ of France covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world, whereas the land area of the French Republic is only 0.45% of the total land area of the Earth.\\n\\nGreece has not yet claimed an exclusive economic zone, although it is entitled to do so, as per UNCLOS 1982 as well as customary international law. This had led to direct threat by Turkey of casus belli if Greece was to declare her exclusive economic zone, although Greece restrained from any kind of declaration so far.\\n\\nTurkey's declaration of casus belli is not related to the EEZ issue. Turkey claims that the Aegean Sea's status as a semi-closed sea affords it a special nature (unlike other semi-closed seas as the Adriatic or even fully enclosed seas as the Black Sea). Moreover, Turkey is not among the signatories of UNCLOS which allows countries to expand the width of their territorial waters up to . Even though Turkey is a persistent objector to the relevant article of UNCLOS, it has expanded its own territorial waters in the Black Sea to . And moreover, in 1995 just after Greek parliament ratifications of UNCLOS (as every signatory state was entitled) , Turkey declared that if Greece expands the width of her territorial waters over , Turkey would conceive this action as a containment attempt and a direct offense to her sovereignty and thus threatened Greece with a war (casus belli).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nJapan has disputes over its EEZ boundaries with all its Asian neighbors (Russia, South Korea, PRC and ROC). The above, and relevant maps at the Sea Around Us Project both indicate Japan's claimed boundaries, and do not take into account neighboring powers' claims.\\n\\nthumbMexico's exclusive economic zones comprise a total surface area of 5,144,295 km, and places Mexico among the countries with the largest areas in the world.\\n\\nthumbNew Zealand's EEZ covers 4,083,744 km, according to the Sea Around Us Project, which is approximately fifteen times the land area of the country. Sources vary significantly on the size of New Zealand's EEZ; for example, a recent government publication gave the area as roughly 4,300,000 km. These figures are for the EEZ of New Zealand proper, and do not include the EEZs of other territories in the Realm of New Zealand (Tokelau, Niue, the Cook Islands and the Ross Dependency).\\n\\nthumbNorway has a large exclusive economic zone of 819 620 km around its coast. The country has a fishing zone of 1,878,953 km, including fishing zones around Svalbard and Jan Mayen . The fact that the European Union shares its economic zones was a big reason why Norway did not enter the EU as a member.\\n\\nIn April 2009, the United Nations Commission for the Limits of the Continental Shelf approved Norway's claim to an additional 235,000 square kilometres of continental shelf. The commission found that Norway and Russia both had valid claims over a portion of shelf in the Barents Sea.\\n\\nrightPhilippines' EEZ covers 2,265,684 (135,783) km\\n\\nThe Polish EEZ covers the area of 30,533 km within the Baltic Sea.\\n\\nleft\\n\\nPortugal has the 3rd largest exclusive economic zone of the EU and the 11th in the world.\\n\\nThe boundary between the EEZs of Portugal and Spain is disputed.

{"title": "Exercise-induced anaphylaxis", "body": "Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) is a syndrome in which the symptoms of anaphylaxis occur related to exercise. \\n\\nIn some incidents, individuals experienced anaphylaxis only after combination exposure to a triggering agent and increased physical activity shortly after the ingestion of the triggering agent. In these individuals, either the exercise or ingestion of the triggering agent alone does not cause anaphylaxis. Triggers include foods (commonly celery, wheat, soy protein, cheese, and shellfish) and medication (aspirin and other NSAID). \\n\\nIn other incidents, individuals experienced anaphylaxis with exercise and no triggering agent.\\n\\nWheat dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis is the result of an IgE mediated allergic response to the ω-gliadin component of wheat glutens (and homologous proteins of certain subspecies Aegilopides speltoides genome BB) and is similar to another condition known as baker's asthma. Neither disease is necessarily linked to gluten intolerance, although both involve IgE subclass of immunoglobulin. Baker's asthma is triggered by the inhalation of flour, and EIA is triggered by the circulation of wheat gliadin peptides in the blood that occurs during exercise or after prolonged use of aspirin or NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen). Unlike gluten sensitivity,WDEIA does not appear to extend to rye or barley glutens, and IgE from patients recognize specifically the omega-gliadin (Gli-B1) gene product on chromosome 1B of wheat. The response of patients with wheat dependent urticaria appeared to parallel those of WDEIA.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Exploration of the High Alps", "body": "The higher region of the Alps were long left to the exclusiveattention of the men of the adjoining valleys, even when Alpine travellers (as distinguished from Alpine climbers) began to visit these valleys. It is reckoned that about 20 glacier passes were certainly known before 1600, about 25 more before 1700, and yet another 20 before 1800; but though the attempt of P.A. Arnod (an official of the duchy of Aosta) in 1689 to \"re-open\" the Col du Ceant may be counted as made by a non-native, historical records do not show any further such activities until the last quarter of the 18th century. Nor did it fare much better with the high peaks, though the two earliest recorded ascents were due to non-natives, that of the Rochemelon in 1358 having been undertaken in fulfilment of a vow, and that of the Mont Aiguille in 1492 by order of Charles VIII of France, in order to destroy its immense reputation for inaccessibility -- in 1555 Conrad Gesner did not climb Pilatus proper, but only the grassy mound of the Gnepfstein, the lowest and the most westerly of the seven summits.\\n\\nThe two first men who really systematically explored the regions of ice and snow were Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740-1799), as regards the Pennine Alps, and the Benedictine monk of Disentis, Placidus a Spescha (1752-1833, most of whose ascents were made before 1806), in the valleys at the sources of the Rhine. In the early 19th century the Meyer family of Aarau conquered in person the Jungfrau (1811) and by deputy the Finsteraarhorn (1812), besides opening several glacier passes, their energy being entirely confined to the Bernese Oberland. Their pioneer work was continued in that district, as well as others, by a number of Swiss, pre-eminent among whom were Gottlieb Samuel Studer (1804-1890) of Bern, and Edouard Desor (1811-1882) of Neuchâtel. The first-known English climber in the Alps was Colonel Mark Beaufoy (1764-1827), who in 1787 made an ascent (the fourth) of Mont Blanc, a mountain to which his fellow-countrymen long exclusively devoted themselves, with a few noteworthy exceptions, such as Principal J.D. Forbes (1809-1868), A.T. Malkin (1803-1888), John Ball (1818-1889), and Sir Alfred Wills (1828-1912). \\n\\nIn the Eastern Alps the serious exploration began with the first ascent of the Großglockner in 1800, initiated by Franz-Xaver Salm-Raifferscheid, archbishop of Gurk. Around Monte Rosa, the Vincent family, Josef Zumstein (1783-1861), and Giovanni Gnifetti (1801-1867) did good work during the half century between 1778 and 1842, while in the Eastern Alps the Archduke John (1782-1850), Prince F. J. C. von Schwarzenberg, archbishop of Salzburg (1809-1885), Valentine Stanig (1774-1847), Adolf Schaubach (1800-1850), above all, P.J. Thurwieser (1789-1865), deserve to be recalled as pioneers in the first half of the 19th century.\\n\\nIn the early fifties of the 19th century the taste for mountaineering rapidly developed for several very different reasons: A great stimulus was given to it by the foundation of the various Alpine clubs, each of which drew together the climbers who dwelt in the same country. The first was the English Alpine Club (founded in the winter of 1857-1858), followed in 1862 by the Austrian Alpine Club (which in 1873 was fused, under the name of the German and Austrian Alpine Club, with the German Alpine Club, founded in 1869), in 1863 by the Italian and Swiss Alpine Clubs, and in 1874 by the French Alpine Club, not to mention numerous minor societies of more local character. It was by the members of these clubs (and a few others) that the minute exploration (now all but complete) of the High Alps was carried out, while much has been done in the way of building club huts, organizing and training guides, &c., to smooth the way for later comers, who would benefit by the detailed information published in the periodicals (the first dates from 1863 only) issued by these clubs.\\n\\nThe following two sub-joined lists give the dates of the first ascent of the greater peaks (apart from the two climbed in 1358 and in 1402, see above), achieved before and after1 January 1858. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ext2", "body": "The ext2 or second extended filesystem is a file system for the Linux kernel. It was initially designed by Rémy Card as a replacement for the extended file system (ext).\\n\\nThe canonical implementation of ext2 is the ext2fs filesystem driver in the Linux kernel. Other implementations (of varying quality and completeness) exist in GNU Hurd, Mac OS X (third-party), Darwin (same third-party as Mac OS X but untested), some BSD kernels, in Atari MiNT, and as third-party Microsoft Windows drivers.\\n\\next2 was the default filesystem in several Linux distribution, including Debian and Red Hat Linux, until supplanted more recently by ext3, which is almost completely compatible with ext2 and is a journaling file system. ext2 is still the filesystem of choice for flash-based storage media (such as SD card, and USB flash drive) since its lack of a journal minimizes the number of writes and flash devices have only a limited number of write cycles. Recent kernels, however, support a journal-less mode of ext4, which would offer the same benefit along with a number of ext4-specific benefits.\\n\\nThe early development of the Linux kernel was made as a cross-development under the Minix operating system. Naturally, it was obvious that the Minix file system would be used as Linux's first file system. The Minix file system was mostly free of bugs, but used 16-bit offsets internally and thus only had a maximum size limit of 64 megabyte. There was also a filename length limit of 14 characters. Because of these limitations, work began on a replacement native file system for Linux. \\n\\nTo ease the addition of new file systems and provide a generic file API, VFS, a virtual file system layer was added to the Linux kernel. The extended file system (ext), was released in April 1992 as the first file system using the VFS API and was included in Linux version 0.96c. The ext file system solved the two major problems in the Minix file system (maximum partition size and filename length limitation to 14 characters), and allowed 2 gigabyte of data and filenames of up to 255 characters. But it still had problems: there was no support for separate access, inode modification and data modification timestamp.\\n\\nAs a solution for these problems, two new filesystems were developed in January 1993: xiafs and the second extended file system (ext2), which was an overhaul of the extended file system incorporating many ideas from the Berkeley Fast File System. ext2 was also designed with extensibility in mind, with space left in many of its on-disk data structures for use by future versions. \\n\\nSince then, ext2 has been a testbed for many of the new extensions to the VFS API. Features such as POSIX ACLs and extended attribute were generally implemented first on ext2 because it was relatively simple to extend and its internals were well-understood.\\n\\nOn Linux kernels prior to 2.6.17, restrictions in the block driver mean that ext2 filesystems have a maximum file size of 2TB.\\n\\next2 is still recommended over journaling file systems on bootable USB flash drives and other solid-state drive. ext2 performs fewer writes than ext3 since it does not need to write to the journal. As the major aging factor of a flash chip is the number of erase cycles, and as those happen frequently on writes, this increases the life span of the solid-state device. Another good practice for filesystems on flash devices is the use of the noatime mount option, for the same reason.\\n\\nThe space in ext2 is split up into block. These blocks are divided into block groups, analogous to cylinder group in the Unix File System. There are typically thousands of blocks on a large file system. Data for any given file is typically contained within a single block group where possible. This is done to reduce external fragmentation and minimize the number of disk seek when reading a large amount of consecutive data.\\n\\nEach block group contains a copy of the superblock and block group descriptor table, and all block groups contain a block bitmap, an inode bitmap, an inode table and finally the actual data blocks.\\n\\nThe superblock contains important information that is crucial to the booting of the operating system, thus backup copies are made in multiple block groups in the file system. However, typically only the first copy of it, which is found at the first block of the file system, is used in the booting.\\n\\nThe group descriptor stores the location of the block bitmap, inode bitmap and the start of the inode table for every block group and these, in turn are stored in a group descriptor table.\\n\\nEvery file or directory is represented by an inode. The inode includes data about the size, permission, ownership, and location on disk of the file or directory. \\n\\nExample of ext2 inode structure:\\n\\nQuote from the linux kernel documentation for ext2:\\n\\nSo, there is a structure in ext2 that has 15 pointers, the first 12 are for direct blocks. Pointer number 13 points to an indirect block, number 14 to a doubly-indirect block and number 15 to a trebly-indirect block.\\n\\nEach directory is a list of directory entries. Each directory entry associates one file name with one inode number, and consists of the inode number, the length of the file name, and the actual text of the file name. To find a file, the directory is searched front-to-back for the associated filename. For reasonable directory sizes, this is fine. But for huge large directories this is inefficient, and ext3 offers a second way of storing directories that is more efficient than just a list of filenames.\\n\\nThe root directory is always stored in inode number two, so that the file system code can find it at mount time. Subdirectories are implemented by storing the name of the subdirectory in the name field, and the inode number of the subdirectory in the inode field. Hard links are implemented by storing the same inode number with more than one file name. Accessing the file by either name results in the same inode number, and therefore the same data.\\n\\nThe special directories \".\" and \"..\" are implemented by storing the names \".\" and \"..\" in the directory, and the inode number of the current and parent directories in the inode field. The only special treatment these two entries receive is that they are automatically created when any new directory is made, and they cannot be deleted.\\n\\nWhen a new file or directory is created, the EXT2 file system must decide where to store the data. If the disk is mostly empty, then data can be stored almost anywhere. However, performance is maximized if the data is clustered with other related data to minimize seek times.\\n\\nThe EXT2 file system attempts to allocate each new directory in the group containing its parent directory, on the theory that accesses to parent and children directories are likely to be closely related. The EXT2 file system also attempts to place files in the same group as their directory entries, because directory accesses often lead to file accesses. However, if the group is full, then the new file or new directory is placed in some other non-full group.\\n\\nThe data blocks needed to store directories and files can found by looking in the data allocation bitmap. Any needed space in the inode table can be found by looking in the inode allocation bitmap.\\n\\nThe reason for some limits of the ext2-file system are the file format of the data and the operating system's kernel. Mostly these factors will be determined once when the file system is built. They depend on the block size and the ratio of the number of blocks and inodes.\\n\\nIn Linux the block size is limited by the architecture page size.\\n\\nThere are also some userspace programs that can't handle files larger than 2&nbsp;GB.\\n\\nThe maximum file size is limited to min( (b/4)+(b/4)+b/4+12, 2*b ) due to the i_block (an array of EXT2_N_BLOCKS) and i_blocks( 32-bits integer value ) representing the amount of b-bytes \"blocks\" in the file. \\n\\nThe limit of sublevel-directories is 31998 due to the link count limit. Directory indexing is not available in ext2, so there are performance issues for directories with a large number of files (10,000+). The theoretical limit on the number of files in a directory is 1.3 × 10, although this is not relevant for practical situations.\\n\\nNote: In Linux kernel 2.4 and earlier block devices were limited to 2 TB, limiting the maximum size of a partition regardless of block size.\\n\\ne2compr is a modification to the ext2 file system driver in the Linux kernel to support online compression and decompression of files on file system level without any support by user applications.\\n\\ne2compr is a small patch against the ext2 file system that allows on-the-fly compression and decompression. It compresses only regular files; the administrative data (superblock, inode, directory files etc.) are not compressed (mainly for safety reasons). Access to compressed blocks is provided for read and write operations. The compression algorithm and cluster size is specified on a per-file basis. Directories can also be marked for compression, in which case every newly created file in the directory will be automatically compressed with the same cluster size and the same algorithm that was specified for the directory.\\n\\ne2compr is not a new file system. It is only a patch to the ext2 file system made to support the EXT2_COMPR_FL flag. It does not require you to make a new partition, and will continue to read or write existing ext2 file systems. One can consider it as simply a way for the read and write routines to access files that could have been created by a simple utility similar to gzip or compress. Compressed and uncompressed files coexist nicely on ext2 partitions.\\n\\nThe latest e2compr-branch is available for current releases of 2.6 and 2.4 Linux kernels, but development is stalled. There are also older branches for older 2.0 and 2.2 kernels, which are more stable.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Extraordinary Machine", "body": "Extraordinary Machine is the third album by American singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, released by Epic Records in the United States on October 4, 2005 (see 2005 in music). Produced by Jon Brion, it was originally to be released in 2003 but was later delayed several times by the record label without explanation, leading to speculation that a dispute had arisen over its commercial appeal. The controversy surrounding the album and leaked recordings of the Jon Brion sessions were the subject of substantial press attention, as well as a highly publicised fan-led campaign to see the album officially released. In collaboration with producers Mike Elizondo and Brian Kehew, Apple re-recorded the album over 2004 and 2005, and it was eventually released more than three years after the original recording sessions began. In 2010, Extraordinary Machine was named the 49th greatest album of the 00s by Rolling Stone magazine.\\n\\nAfter completing a concert tour in support of her second album When the Pawn... (1999) in 2000, Fiona Apple relocated to Los Angeles. \"The first couple of years [after Pawn], I didn't have anything left in me to write about ... I just figured if the songs came to me, they came to me, and if not, 'Oh, well, it's been fun'\", she said. During her hiatus, Apple contemplated retiring from her recording career. In spring 2002 Apple and Jon Brion, her longtime friend and producer on When the Pawn, met for their weekly lunch meeting. Brion's five-year relationship with comedienne Mary Lynn Rajskub had abruptly ended during the shooting of the Paul Thomas Anderson film Punch-Drunk Love (2002), which Brion was scoring. He reportedly \"begged\" Apple to make another album after being forced to watch hours of footage of Rajskub whilst working on the film: \"I need work that can save me\". Apple agreed, and Brion went to Apple's label, Epic Records, with strict stipulations (including no deadline), which the label eventually agreed to. A tentative November 2002 release date was then set.\\n\\nAfter performing the then-untitled \"Not About Love\" at a Brion concert in February, Apple started studio work on the album the following June at Ocean Way Recording, where she played for Brion the first five songs she had written for the album. She debuted the song \"A New Version of Me\" (later renamed \"Better\", and then \"Better Version of Me\") live at Club Largo where Brion has a regular Friday-night gig, often joined by musical friends in August. By late 2002 Apple, Brion, engineer Tom Biller and percussionist Matt Chamberlain were at work in a wing of the Paramour Mansion, which was built in 1923 by silent film star Antonio Moreno; the four used the building as a temporary residence from early 2003, and Chamberlain said the experience of recording there was \"completely amazing\". With the album half complete in April 2003, Brion, Apple and Biller worked at Cello Studios, and a new release date of July 22 was announced. Brion and Apple then travelled to England later that month, to record strings and orchestration for the songs at Abbey Road Studios in London. The album was completed from Brion's perspective by May 2003, at which point the release was pushed back to September 30. But by Fall 2003 Apple and Brion were back in the recording studio adding finishing touches to the album, thus forcing back the release date to February 2004 (this was later changed to \"early 2004\").\\n\\nLittle by little, small details about the songs were revealed through newspaper and magazine articles. A New York Times article on Jon Brion in August 2003 revealed the title of another song on the album, \"Oh Well\", with Brion stating that he cried the first time he heard Apple play it. Brion worked solidly on \"Oh Well\" for over a week, and would later refer to it as the album's \"problem child\". The October 2003 issue of Rolling Stone depicted the album as being \"all over the place\" (a sentiment shared by Apple herself) and \"definitely eclectic\". The slow-paced track \"Extraordinary\" was referred to as \"a Tin Pan Alley-esque blend of Tom Waits and Vaudeville\", while the much more energetic \"Better\" was described as \"an OutKast-like deluge of beats\". In February 2004 an article in Spin magazine confirmed the title of the album and a new song, \"Red, Red, Red\", which had reportedly been inspired by a book about optical illusions.\\n\\nIn late June 2004 the song \"Extraordinary\" which had since been retitled as the title track was leaked onto the internet. Soon after, a \"rough mix\" of \"Better Version of Me\" also leaked, with the following inscription listed as a comment in the properties of the MP3 file: \"It has some good bits, but I still think we never have topped the second version. Ideally, we would combine some of this with that, but obviously we can't. Sigh. Ask the others what they think I know she was partial to both of them, particularly the second\". Josh Korr of the Tampa Bay Times wrote, \"With a playfulness and penchant for odd sounds and instruments that channel the spirit of Brian Wilson's Smile, Apple's first songs since 1999 make Norah Jones, Joss Stone, Alicia Keys and other pretenders sound like American Idol rejects\", while Entertainment Weekly called the songs \"tantalizing, brazenly eccentric art pop ... With Apple, the weirder, the better\".\\n\\nleftAfter months of no official news, an article about Jon Brion appeared in the October 8, 2004 issue of Entertainment Weekly. It revealed that the album had been shelved since its completion in 2003 due to \"the label not hearing any obvious singles\". A representative for Epic Records stated that the album was to be released in February 2005, and had been delayed because Apple had decided to re-record some of the songs. Brion later clarified the status of the album in an interview with MTV News in January 2005: he said that Epic had desired material in the vein of Apple's debut album Tidal (1996), but that when confronted by Machine, \"it's just not the obvious easy sell to them\". When USA Today asked Apple herself about when the album would be released, she replied: \"You'll probably know before I do\".\\n\\nShortly thereafter, members of the forum fionahaswings.com formed the organization Free Fiona and started a movement for an international, week-long mail campaign to flood Sony with support for Apple and for the release of the album. A website devoted to the campaign, freefiona.com, was created. In response to the campaign, Epic president Steve Barnett said: \"It's our understanding that Fiona is still in the midst of recording her next album, and we at Epic Records join music lovers everywhere in eagerly anticipating her next release\". On February 26, 2005 radio DJ Andrew Harms at 107.7 The End in Seattle began playing previously unheard tracks from a bootleg copy of the album, and before long, poor quality copies of \"Not About Love\", \"Get Him Back\" and \"Used to Love Him\" were circulating on the internet. Harms said of the situation: \"this is pretty special ... with an established [artist] like Fiona, to have that happen is pretty crazy, so to stumble upon a full-length copy of the record was incredible\"; he also noted the positive response from listeners the songs had received.\\n\\nBy early March 2005 radio recordings of \"Waltz\", \"Please, Please, Please\", \"Oh, Sailor\" and \"Window\" had leaked online; those were followed by better quality album cuts of \"Oh Well\" and \"Red, Red, Red\". Soon after, CD-quality versions of all the tracks were released through the BitTorrent website TorrentBox. They received a positive review from the New York Times, who described the album as \"an oddball gem\", adding \"Had it been released, Extraordinary Machine would have been a fine counterbalance to a pop moment full of monolithic, self-righteous sincerity.\" Ed Bumgardner concurred, saying the album was \"certainly a work of daring and sophistication, as wildly imaginative as it is entertaining\", while Will Dukes said \"Extraordinary Machine flaunts a quirky, cold-world cohesiveness that's as inviting as it is alienating.\" According to the file-sharing tracking website BigChampagne in March, 46,759 people were sharing the leaked tracks on major P2P networks. The RIAA later contacted webmasters of sites hosting the files and asked them to be taken down, while the BitTorrent files subsequently vanished from the TorrentBox website.\\n\\nthumbEntertainment Weekly reported in its June 24, 2005 issue that Apple was preparing work on a \"second third\" album with producer Brian Kehew of the electronica band Moog Cookbook, further fueling speculation amongst fans that the leaked Machine tracks had been shelved indefinitely. A July 2005 online chat, little noticed at the time, occurred with hip hop musician Questlove on a website devoted to The Roots. He said the album was \"not cancelled\", was in co-production with Mike Elizondo, and would be a DualDisc, all of which was later confirmed as true. (Questlove also said he played drums on the album, and in the March 2005 issue of Rolling Stone, he had said he may collaborate with Apple on her next album.)\\n\\nAfter months of silence, Epic released a statement regarding the album's future on August 15, 2005: Extraordinary Machine was to be officially released on October 4, 2005, extensively reworked by co-producers Elizondo and Kehew. Elizondo had played bass on two When the Pawn tracks, but one reported had described him as \"a curious departure from Brion\" because of his more well-known production work with popular hip hop artists such as 50 Cent, Dr. Dre and Eminem. He and Kehew worked at the Phantom Studio located behind Elizondo's Westlake Village home, reworking each song; track by track they built from Apple's piano and vocals, added live drum with the help of Abe Laboriel Jr. and Questlove, and then instrumental flourishes. Once the song frameworks had been completed, Apple returned to the studio and recorded final performances.\\n\\nOf the eleven tracks previously leaked, two remained unchanged: \"Extraordinary Machine\" and \"Waltz\"; but nine were completely rearranged. One new song, \"Parting Gift\", was also included on the album; it is a solo vocal piece with piano that was recorded on the first take. Elizondo said he felt that most of the tracks sound \"radically different\", and that even though he listened to Brion's version, \"Everything was done from scratch\". The New York Times suggested that Epic Records was not impressed with fan interest in the bootleg, and that Apple never considered the album finished; but by the time of the leak, she and Elizondo had been at work for some time (since April 2004). In an interview with Rolling Stone in September 2005, Apple explained her decision: \"I gathered scraps for songs, and I ended up writing the rest on the way, a totally new approach for me...[but] I didn't have enough time to live with the songs before recording them, so I really didn't know what I wanted\".\\n\\nSpeaking with Billboard, Elizondo acknowledged that it was \"a little disheartening\" to be working with the knowledge that Brion's version was available to the public, but applauded Apple's \"amazing core of fans\" for their efforts to have the album released: \"The way they interpreted it was, the label isn't putting out her record, so we're going to do it for her. That's very admirable\". However, he defended Apple's decision to press on until the album reached the finished state that she had envisioned. On the day of the announcement, the label placed \"O' Sailor\" for streaming on Apple's MySpace site (the entire album was made available for streaming on September 27), and streamed both \"O' Sailor\" and \"Parting Gift\" on Apple's official website. Additionally, exclusive video material was put up weekly in the run-up to the album's release and most of which was later included on the DVD side of the album DualDisc, along with recordings of five of Apple's live performances at Largo.\\n\\nDespite rumors that the album had caused a rift between Brion and Apple, they performed together at Largo the Friday evening before Epic's announcement. Brion told MTV News, \"She re-recorded a bunch of stuff, but whatever, that's her business. I remain a fan and think she's great, and she shouldn't have to meet too much resistance\"; meanwhile, Elizondo insisted Brion was \"cool on all fronts\" about the proposed re-recording. However, Brion struck out at the bootleg version of the album: \"It's wrong...I don't like those [leaked] versions. It's stuff that doesn't reflect what we recorded, for the most part\". In late 2005 MTV News reported that Brion and Apple may collaborate again to complete the original recording sessions for Extraordinary Machine and release it officially in the near future. Apple said \"I really think it would be cool to compare [the two versions].\"\\n\\nthumbThe official version of Extraordinary Machine attracted universal acclaim according to metacritic upon its release: it was placed number one on year-end top albums lists in Entertainment Weekly, The New York Times and Slant magazine, within the top five in The Village Voice, Blender magazine and Rolling Stone, and in the top ten in the Los Angeles Times and Spin magazine. A minority of publications commented less favourably about the album; Stylus magazine described it as \"a rudderless piece of work\" and \"a bitterly disappointing listen\", while the website Pitchfork Media (which placed the leaked version of the album at number forty-six on their \"Top 50 Albums of 2005\" list) wrote, \"The shame of it all is that Apple, after six years of silence, could've made a more definitive, progressive statement rather than something familiar and similar and we've got the bootlegs to prove it\". Extraordinary Machine was nominated for the 2006 Grammy Award for \"Best Pop Vocal Album\", losing to Kelly Clarkson's Breakaway (see Grammy Awards of 2006).\\n\\nDuring mid-August 2005 and ahead of the album's release in October, both \"O' Sailor\" and \"Parting Gift\" were made available as a bundle download at the online iTunes Music Store. While \"O' Sailor\" was released separately at other digital music stores, video promotion for \"Parting Gift\" began later that month. Extraordinary Machine debuted at number seven on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with 94,000 copies sold in its first week of release, making it Apple's first top ten album; however, it fell out of the top ten in its second week with a sales decline of almost fifty percent. The video for \"O' Sailor\" began to receive television airplay in November, and the following January the \"Not About Love\" video made its internet premiere; early the next month, \"Get Him Back\" was released to radio stations. None of the singles attracted substantial airplay or digital downloads, and consequently they did not appear on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 or Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart.\\n\\nAs of April 19 the album had sold 462,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan, which is below the sales of both Tidal (which sold 2.7 million copies) and When the Pawn (which sold 920,000). Prior to receiving a gold certification from the RIAA in January 2006 for shipments of 500,000 copies, it was nominated for the New Pantheon award, which honours \"left of centre\" albums that shipped less than 500,000 copies in the U.S. between July 2004 and October 2005. Apple went on a three-week U.S. tour from November 22 to December 11 to promote the album, and from January 25 to March 5, 2006 she supported British band Coldplay on the first half of their North American X&Y tour. Apple also appeared on her own headlining summer tour from April 10, 2006 to October 29, 2006, with Damien Rice and Davíd Garza as her supporting acts for the thirty-five shows.\\n\\nAll songs written by Fiona Apple.\\n\\n"}

The phrase indicates that the liturgy of the 1962 Missal, the celebration of which was permitted more widely by the motu proprio, differs from the normal present-day liturgy of the Roman Rite (the \"ordinary form\").\\n\\nAt present, the ordinary form of celebration of Mass of the Roman Rite is that established in the revision of the Roman Missal, promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969.\\n\\nIn the motu proprio, and in the accompanying letter that he sent to the Bishops, Pope Benedict designated the 1962 form an extraordinary form, not the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, although the latter term has been adopted in certain quarters. The official text of the motu proprio was in Latin, which has neither definite nor indefinite article, but the accompanying letter was not issued in Latin, and its official English text, like the unofficial English version of the Latin motu proprio, is unambiguous.\\n\\nThe Pope wrote as follows:\\n\\nAnother example of the Holy See's use of the technical term \"extraordinary\" in liturgical contexts is the instruction ''Redemptionis Sacramentum'', which insisted on the expression \"extraordinary minister of Holy Communion\", to the exclusion of terms such as “special minister of Holy Communion”. This 2004 instruction thus repeated the terminology used in canons 910 §2 and 943 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which, in the case of other sacraments also, insists on the distinction between the \"ordinary\" minister of the sacrament and those who in certain circumstances are allowed, by exception, to administer the sacrament. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "F. Lee Bailey", "body": "Francis Lee Bailey Jr., commonly referred to as F. Lee Bailey, (born June 10, 1933) is an American criminal defense lawyer who served as the lawyer in the Sam Sheppard re-trial. He was also the supervisory attorney over attorney Mark J. Kadish in the court martial of Captain Ernest Medina for the My Lai Massacre, among other high profile trials, and was one of the lawyers for the defense in the O. J. Simpson trial. He has also had a number of visible defeats, legal controversies, and personal trouble with the law, and was disbarred for misconduct while defending his client Claude DuBoc. In spite of his difficulties, he still has a reputation for being a highly successful defense attorney, and was the Chairman and CEO of IMPAC, Integrated Control Systems, Inc., a Florida corporation.\\n\\nBailey was born in Waltham, Massachusetts. He went to Cardigan Mountain School and then Kimball Union Academy, graduating in the class of 1950. Bailey studied at Harvard College, but dropped out in 1952 to join the United States Marine Corps. Bailey received his aviator wings in 1954. He served as a jet fighter pilot and a legal officer. He was discharged in 1956. Bailey received his LL.B. from Boston University, where he was ranked first in his graduating class in 1960. \\n\\nIn 1954, Dr. Sam Sheppard was found guilty in the murder of his wife Marilyn. The case was believed to be the inspiration for the ''Fugitive'' television series (1963–1967) and the 1993 movie. Bailey, at the time a resident of Rocky River, Ohio, was hired by Sheppard's brother Stephen to help in his brother's appeal. In 1966, Bailey successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that Sheppard had been denied due process, winning a re-trial. A not-guilty verdict followed. This case established Bailey's reputation as a skilled defense attorney and was the first of many high-profile cases.\\n\\nWhile defendant Albert DeSalvo was in jail for the \"Green Man\" sexual assaults, he confessed his guilt in the \"Boston Strangler\" murders to Bailey. DeSalvo was found guilty of the assaults but was never tried for the stranglings.\\n\\nDr. Coppolino was accused of murdering his wife, Dr. Carmela Coppolino (August 28, 1965), and his neighbor Lt. Col. William Farber (July 30, 1963). The prosecution claimed that Coppolino injected his victims with a curare-like substance called succinylcholine chloride, which at the time was undetectable due to limited forensic technology. Bailey, who had just won Sam Sheppard an acquittal in November 1966, successfully defended Coppolino in the New Jersey case over the death of Lt. Col. William Farber in December 1966. However, Coppolino was convicted of murdering his wife in Florida. He was paroled after serving 12 years of his sentence.\\n\\nBailey successfully defended U.S. Army Captain Ernest Medina in his 1971 court-martial for responsibility in the My Lai incident during the Vietnam War.\\n\\nThe case of Patty Hearst, a newspaper heiress who had committed armed bank robberies after being kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), was one of Bailey's defeats. Patty Hearst describes his closing argument in her autobiography as \"disjointed\" and that she suspected he had been drinking. During his closing argument, Bailey spilled a glass of water on his pants.\\n\\nBailey joined the O. J. Simpson defense team just before the preliminary hearing. Bailey held numerous press conferences to discuss the progress of the case. In a press conference prior to his cross-examination of Mark Fuhrman, Bailey said, \"any lawyer in his right mind who would not be looking forward to cross-examining Mark Fuhrman is an idiot.\" His famous cross-examination of Fuhrman is considered by many to be the key to Simpson's acquittal. In front of a jury composed predominantly of people of color, Bailey got the detective to claim he never used the word \"nigger\" to describe blacks at any time during the previous 10 years, a claim the defense team easily found evidence to refute. Ultimately, the statement that Bailey drew from the detective forced Fuhrman to plead the fifth in his next courtroom appearance, thereby undermining his credibility with the jury and the otherwise devastating evidence he allegedly found. Bailey also attracted minor attention for keeping a silver flask on the defense table, which fellow defense attorney Robert Kardashian claimed contained only coffee.\\n\\nChantal McCorkle (born 1968, Slough, England) is a British citizen. Along with William, her American husband, she was tried and convicted in 1998 in Florida for her part in a financial fraud. The McCorkles sold kits purporting to show buyers how to get rich by buying property in foreclosures and government auctions. They advertised on infomercial; among the grounds for their conviction was their representation in the infomercials that they owned luxury automobiles and airplanes (actually rented for the commercials), and their use of purported testimonials from satisfied customers, who were actually paid actors.\\n\\nShe, represented by Mark Horwitz, and her husband, represented by Bailey, were each originally sentenced to over 24 years in federal prison under mandatory sentencing laws. After two appeals, the McCorkles' sentences were reduced in 2006 to 18 years.\\n\\nBailey was featured in a RKO television special, in which he conducted a mock trial, examining various expert \"witnesses\" on the subject of the Paul is Dead rumor. One of the experts was Fred LaBour, whose article in The Michigan Daily had been instrumental in the spread of the urban legend. LaBour told Bailey during a pre-show meeting that he had made the whole thing up. Bailey responded, \"Well, we have an hour of television to do. You're going to have to go along with this.\" The program aired locally in New York City on November 30, 1969, and was never re-aired.\\n\\nBailey's visible public profile has come both as a result of the cases he has taken and for his own personal actions. In 2001 he was disbarred in the state of Florida, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment was the result of his handling of stock in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts.  \\n\\nIn 1994, while the O.J. Simpson case was being tried, Bailey and Robert Shapiro represented Claude DuBoc, an accused marijuana dealer. In a plea bargain agreement with the U.S. Attorney, DuBoc agreed to turn over his assets to the U.S. government. His assets included a large block of stock in BioChem, worth approximately $6 million at the time of the plea deal. When the government sought to collect the stock, it had increased in value to $20 million. Bailey claimed he was entitled to the appreciation in payment of his legal fees. Since he had used the stock as collateral for loans, he was unable to turn over the stock to the government. In 2000, he was sent to prison for contempt. After 44 days at the Federal Correctional Institution, Tallahassee, Bailey's brother succeeded in raising the money to enable him to return the stock, and he was freed.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "FC Dynamo Kyiv", "body": "FC Dynamo Kiev () is a professional football club based in the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. Founded in 1927, the club currently participates in the Ukrainian Premier League and has spent its entire history in the top league of Soviet and later Ukrainian football. Dynamo Kyiv has won twelve league titles, nine Ukrainian Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and two UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. \\n\\nAs part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in December 1991, the club has also won 13 USSR Championships, 9 USSR Cup, and 3 USSR Super Cup, making Dynamo the most successful club in the history of the Soviet Top League.\\n\\nDynamo's home is the 16,900 capacity Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium in Kiev, with a few bigger games played at Olimpiysky National Sports Complex.\\n\\nOn May 13, 1927 the statute of the Kievan Proletarian Sport Society (PST) Dynamo was officially registered by the special commission in affairs of public organizations and unions of the Kiev okrug (district). The All-Union sport society of Dinamo itself was just recently formed in 1923 on the initiative of the \"Iron Felix\". Under the banner of Dynamo gathered the representatives of GPU (Main Political Directorate), the best footballers of which defended the honors of the \"Sovtorgsluzhashchie\" club (Soviet salesmen). However the leadership of Dynamo did not dare to reorganized the well established club and the main title contender in the middle of a playing season and therefore the first mentioning about the football club Dynamo could only be found on April 5, 1928 in the Russian-speaking newspaper \"Vecherni Kiev\" (Evening Kiev). \\n\\nIt was then when by the initiative of Semen Zapadny, chief of Kiev GPU, the football team was created. His deputy, Serhiy Barminsky, started to form the team not only out of regular chekists, but also footballers of other clubs in the city. All the footballers were either part of the consolidated city team or the city champions. Its first official game the newly created team played on July 1, 1928 against a local consolidated city team while visiting Bila Tserkva. Already on the fifth minute the Dynamo-men opened the score in the game, however at the end the club lost it 1:2. On July 15 the Bila Tserkva newspaper \"Radyanska Nyva\" (Soviet fields) put it in such words:\\n\\nThe next its match Dynamo played on July 17, 1928 against another Dynamo from the port city of Odessa. As the club gained more experience and played on a regular basis, it started to fill the stadium with spectators with both the club and football in general gaining popularity in Soviet Ukraine.\\n\\nDuring the Soviet era, the club was one of the main rivals, and often the only rival, to football clubs from Moscow. Its ability to challenge the dominance of the Moscow clubs in Soviet football, and frequently defeat them to win the Soviet championship, was a matter of national pride for Ukraine. Leaders of the Ukrainian SSR unofficially regarded the club as their national team and provided it with generous support, making Dynamo a professional team of international importance.\\n\\nIn 1936 the first Soviet Championship was played, and Dynamo Kiev was one of the pioneers of the newly formed league. The club's early successes were however limited to a 2nd place finish in 1936 and 3rd place in 1937. In the 1941 season, the club only played 9 matches, as World War II interrupted league play.\\n\\nthumbThe story is often told of how the Dynamo team, playing as \"Start, City of Kiev All-Stars\", was executed by a firing squad in the summer of 1942 for defeating an All-Star team from the German armed forces by 5-1. The actual story, as recounted by Y. Kuznetsov, is considerably more complex. This match has subsequently become known as \"The Death Match\".\\n\\nAfter the Nazi occupation of Ukraine began, several members of the Dynamo team found employment in the city's Bakery No. 3, and continued to play amateur football. During Kiev's invasion, the team was spotted by the Germans and were invited to play against an army team. The team played under the name of \"Start\", comprising eight players from Dynamo Kiev (Nikolai Trusevych, Mikhail Svyridovskiy, Nikolai Korotkykh, Oleksiy Klimenko, Fedir Tyutchev, Mikhail Putistin, Ivan Kuzmenko, Makar Honcharenko) and three players from Lokomotiv Kiev (Vladimir Balakin, Vasil Sukharev and Mikhail Melnyk). \\n\\nIn July and August 1942 \"Start\" played a series of matches against the Germans and their allies. On July 12 a German army team was defeated. A stronger army team was selected for the next match on July 17, which \"Start\" defeated 6–0. On July 19 \"Start\" defeated the Hungarian team MSG Wal by 5–1. The Hungarians proposed a return match, held on July 26, but were defeated again 3–2.\\n\\n\"Start\"'s streak was noticed and a match was announced for August 6 against a \"most powerful\" \"undefeated\" German Luftwaffe Flakelf team, but despite the game being talked up by the newspapers, they failed to report the 5–1 result. On August 9 \"Start\" played a \"friendly\" against Flakelf and again defeated them. The team defeated Rukh 8–0 on August 16, and afterwards, some of \"Start\"'s players were arrested by the Gestapo, tortured – Nikolai Korotkykh dying under torture – and sent to the nearby labour camp at Siretz. There is speculation that the players were arrested due to the intrigues of Georgy Shvetsov, founder and trainer of the \"Rukh\" team, as the arrests were made in a couple of days after \"Start\" defeated \"Rukh\".\\n\\nIn February 1943, following an attack by partisans or a conflict of the prisoners and administration, one-third of the prisoners at Siretz were killed in reprisal, including Ivan Kuzmenko, Oleksey Klymenko, and the goalkeeper Nikolai Trusevich. Three of the other players, Makar Honcharenko, Fedir Tyutchev and Mikhail Sviridovskiy, who were in a work squad in the city that day, were arrested a few days later or, according to other sources, escaped and hid in the city until it was liberated.\\n\\nThe story inspired two films: the 1961 Hungarian film drama \"Két félidő a pokolban\" and the 1981 American film Escape to Victory.\\n\\nIn 1995, Dynamo qualified for the UEFA Champions League by defeating Danish-side AaB Aalborg in the qualification round. \\n\\nA few weeks later, following Dynamo's first group stage match against Panathinaikos, which they won 1–0, Spanish referee Antonio López Nieto filed a complaint to UEFA that he and his linesmen had been approached by two officials from Dynamo who offered them two fur coats and an unspecified amount of money. As a result, the club was immediately expelled from the competition, with Aalborg taking its place.\\n\\nDespite an appeal to the UEFA following the incident, Dynamo Kyiv was banned from UEFA competitions for the subsequent two years and club's officials Igor Surkis (general manager) and Vasyliy Babiychuk (general secretary) were banned from football for life. These decisions would later be reversed, with Dynamo resuming play in European competitions the following season and Igor Surkis continuing his work at the club.\\n\\nAfter the Soviet Union's collapse, the club, now using the Ukrainian name FC Dynamo Kyiv, became a member of the newly-formed Ukrainian Premier League. Dynamo's status as the country's principal club did not change with the break-up as they went on to dominate domestic competitions, winning or being runner-up in every year of the Premier League's existence and becoming a fixture in the UEFA Champions League. Its main rival in Ukraine is Shakhtar Donetsk, a team from the Donbas region, who came second to Dynamo several times before winning its first Premier League in 2002. The matches between these two sides are called the Ukrainian derby.\\n\\nIn 1996, the club modified their logo to the one that continues to be used today. In 2007, as a part of club's 80 year anniversary two gold stars were added to the top of the crest, representing ten Ukrainian championship titles and ten USSR champion titles. Due to club's poor performance in the UEFA Champions League during the last two seasons, Dynamo's management took a somewhat unexpected decision by appointing the first foreign manager in the club's history. Previously, only former players or Dynamo football academy graduates became managers, but in December 2007 Russian coach Yuri Semin was invited to become the new manager of Dynamo Kiev. Semin's first success came shortly after in a friendly competition Channel One Cup organised in Israel over winter-break. The club went on to confidently defeat both Dynamo's former main rival Spartak Moscow 3-0, and Dynamo's current main rival Shakhtar Donetsk in the final, winning the competition for the first time in its history. However, the club yielded to Shakhtar in both the Ukrainian Cup and Ukrainian Premier League in 2008. In 2009. in the club's most successful European campaign since 1999, it reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup (eliminating such teams as Valencia CF and Paris Saint Germain) but was defeated at that stage by Shakhtar Donetsk, losing in Donetsk 1-2 after a 1-1 home draw. However, 2009 also brought success as the club celebrated its 13th Ukrainian Premier League title.\\n\\nDynamo Kiev has participated in all of the USSR and Ukrainian championships to date, and has won both competitions more times than any other team. The club's best performances were in the 1970s and 1980s, a time at which the USSR national football team was composed mostly of players from the club. Dynamo Kiev also tied the national record for winning three consecutive Soviet Premier League titles in 1966, 1967, and 1968. Dynamo Kiev won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1975 and 1986 as well as the European Super Cup in 1975, after two games against Bayern Munich. In 1977, 1987, and 1999, the club reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League. These victories are associated with the name of Valeri Lobanovsky, who played for the club in the 1960s and later became the club's long-term head coach. In 2009, the club again reached the semi-finals of UEFA Cup.\\n\\nDynamo striker Oleg Blokhin is the Soviet Premier League's all-time top scorer with 211 goals, and has also made more appearances than any other player in the championship's history with 432.\\n\\nDynamo's traditional colours are white and dark blue, with white being the predominant colour. Throughout their history the club has usually played in a white shirt and blue shorts, until 1961 when a blue sash was briefly added to the kit. Although it was removed soon afterwards, in 2004 the club's management decided to restore the famous sash as a talisman. It was added to the away kit and remained there until the beginning of the 2008–2009 season, when it was replaced by a white kit with a shirt having thin blue vertical stripes, the first time in over 50 years that a club has worn such a pattern.\\n\\nBefore the break up of the Soviet Union, Dynamo's kit was similar to Metalist, yellow shirts and blue shorts. That kit at the time carried a symbolical meaning, representing the national colours of the yet-not-adopted Ukraine national flag.Recently, in the early years of Ukrainian independence, the club swapped their yellow colour for white. However blue remained one of Dynamo's colours and is still a main colour of the club's away kit.\\n\\nThe club's current sponsors, Adidas and Ukrainian bank Privat Bank, feature on the team shirt, the former also being the manufacturer of the kit.\\n\\nDynamo's first logo which featured on their shirts in 1927 was a signature blue \"Д\" (D) in a vertical rhombus. Over the years, the club's logo has undergone many changes and replacements, but the signature D has remained ever since. \\n\\nIn 2003 after Dynamo won their 10th domestic trophy, a golden star was added at the top of the logo to celebrate club's success. The second star was added to the logo in 2007 during celebrations of Dynamo's 80 year anniversary. Although Dynamo won only 13 Ukrainian league titles, their 13 reigns as USSR Champions were taken into account, which some consider a reply to actions of Dynamo's former top rival Spartak Moscow, who had done the same thing several years previously.\\n\\nrigh\\n\\nSeveral players have won individual awards during or for their time with Dynamo Kyiv\\n\\nEuropean Footballer of the Year (Ballon d'Or)\\n\\nUEFA Golden Player Award\\n\\nFIFA 100\\n\\nEuropean Championship winners\\n\\nTwo players have won the European Championship whilst at Dynamo Kyiv.\\n\\nrightThe club's home ground, Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium, is situated in a picturesque park located in the centre of the city, close to the Dnieper River bank. The stadium holds 16,873 spectators, and has been club's home ever since 1934. When it was built the stadium's capacity was 23,000. After being destroyed in 1941 during the war, it was rebuilt in 1954. By the end of the century, stadium was reconstructed once more now becoming a football only venue, and having individual seats installed, which reduced the capacity down to its present capacity. In 2002 after a sudden death of Dynamo's long time player and coach Valeriy Lobanovskyi, the stadium was renamed in his honour. After NSK Olympiyskyi was closed for reconstruction in 2008, Dynamo also bagan to play its European games at the Lobanovsky Stadium.rightDue to a high demand for European fixtures of the club throughout its European history Dynamo played majority of their home fixtures at Kiev's and Ukraine's largest stadium Olympiysky National Sport Complex historically dubbed The Republican Stadium, which held 83,450 spectators. The stadium has been the home of Ukrainian Cup final since its inaugural game in 1992 and up until 2007. The stadium was closed for a major reconstruction in 2008, after Ukraine and Poland have been chosen as the hosts for UEFA Euro 2012. Olympiysky will be Kiev's main venue as well as a stadium to host the final, it will also become an UEFA Elite rated stadiums.The team also has a modern-equipped training base in the Kiev suburb of Koncha-Zaspa. he club maintains its own football school for children and youths, also situated in Kiev. Junior Dynamo teams are colloquially known as Dynamo-2 and Dynamo-3.

G. Howard & J. S. Vitter of the computer science departmentof the Brown University & Duke University in USA, and presented at the DCCin Snowbird, Utah in 1993.\\n\\nrightLike other lossless codecs for continuous-tone images, FELICS operates by decorrelating the image and encoding it with an entropy coder. The decorrelation is the context  where and  where  are the pixel's two nearest neighbors (causal, already coded and known at the decoder) used for providing the context to code thepresent pixel .Except at the top and left edges, these are the pixel above and the pixel to the left.For example, the neighbors of pixel X in the diagram are A and B, but if X were at the left side, its neighbors would be B and D.\\n\\nP lies within the closed interval [L, H] roughly half the time.Otherwise, it is above H or below L. These can be encoded as 1, 01, and 00 respectively (p. 4).The following figure shows the (idealized) histogramof the pixels and their intensity values along the x-axis, and frequency of occurrence along the y-axis.\\n\\nThe distribution of P within the range [L, H] is nearly uniform with a minor peak near the center  of this range.When P falls in the range [L, H], P − L is encoded using an adjusted binary code such that values in the center of the range use floor(log(Δ + 1)) bits and values at the ends use ceil(log(Δ + 1)) bits (p. 2).For example, when Δ = 11, the codes for P − L in 0 to 11 may be 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 010, 011, 100, 101, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111.\\n\\nOutside the range, P tends to follow a geometric distribution on each side (p. 3).It is encoded using a Rice code with parameters chosen based on previous choices.For each Δ and each possible Rice code parameter k, the algorithm keeps track of the total number of bits that would have been used to encode pixels outside the range.Then for each pixel, it chooses the Rice code with the based on Δ at the pixel.\\n\\nFELICS improvements include methods for estimating Δ and estimating k.For instance, Howard and Vitter's article recognizes that relatively flat areas (with small Δ, especially where L = H) may have some noise, and compression performance in these areas improves by widening the interval, increasing the effective Δ.It is also possible to estimate the optimal k for a given Δ based on the mean of all prediction residues seen so far, which is faster and uses less memory than computing the number of bits used for each k.\\n\\n"}

The team was sold in 1999 to the Pinnacle Motorsports Group and then to Davis & Weight Motorsports.\\n\\nFILMAR began racing in 1990 when they fielded the #8 Oldsmobile driven by Bobby Hamilton in the Busch series. Originally unsponsored, they picked up sponsorship from TIC Financial Industries midway through the season. Hamilton had seven top-fives and finished eleventh in points, but departed for the Winston Cup series and was replaced by David Green. Despite missing a pair of races early in the season, Green won the pole for the season-opening Goody's 300 and won at Lanier Raceway. He finished thirteenth in points and finished runner-up to Jeff Gordon for Rookie of the Year honors. At the end of the season, Green was replaced by Jeff Burton. Burton had four top-fives, including a win at New Hampshire International Speedway, and finished ninth in points. \\n\\nIn 1993, Baby Ruth became the team's sponsor as they switched to Ford, and despite winning at Myrtle Beach Speedway, Burton and the team dropped to fourteenth in points. The team also made its Cup debut that year with Burton at New Hampshire, starting 6th but finishing 37th after their #0 Ford wrecked near the midway point of the race.\\n\\nrightAfter Burton left to run for Stavola Brothers Racing's Cup program, Kenny Wallace was hired as the team's new driver for 1994. Wallace won a pole at Nazareth Speedway and won at Bristol, Martinsville, and Richmond late in the year and finished fourth in points. They also ran a Cup race at Michigan, finishing nineteenth in the #81 car.\\n\\nIn 1995, FILMAR and Wallace split time between the Cup and Busch Series. In Cup, the team ran 11 races, finishing in the top-30 three times. In Busch, the team ran fifteen races with sponsorship from Red Dog and won at Richmond and finished 27th in points. In addition to winning again at Richmond in 1996, the team moved up to the Cup series full-time with sponsorship from Square D. Wallace had a seventh place finish at North Carolina Speedway and finished 28th in points. The following season, FILMAR ran its last Busch race at Richmond as the #12 Graybar Ford, starting 27th and finishing 26th. That year, Wallace won his first two career poles in Cup at Martinsville and Bristol. Despite two top-tens, Wallace and the team dropped to 33rd in the standings.\\n\\nIn 1998, Wallace posted seven top-tens but failed to qualify twice, finishing 31st in points.\\n\\nTowards the end of 1998, Wallace announced he and Square D would be departing FILMAR and join Andy Petree Racing. After rumors spread that Todd Bodine or Willy T. Ribbs would be the team's new driver for 1999, Marcotti sold the team to an originization called the Pinnacle Motorsports Group. The team planned to run that year's Daytona 500 with Morgan Shepherd driving, but failed to qualify. The group was sold again to Davis & Weight Motorsports late in the season. The team made its Busch debut at the Food City 250 with Brandon Sperling driving the #55 Pontiac Grand Prix with sponsorship from the University of Florida. He started and finished 27th.

{"title": "FMA SAIA 90", "body": "The FMA SAIA 90 was an air superiority aircraft designed by the FMA (Fabrica Militar de Aviones) with the collaboration of Dornier in the mid-1980s. The SAIA 90 which was the last stage of the ACA (Avión Caza Argentino) project, which was started by the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional to develop an Argentine fighter aircraft.\\n\\nThe three stages of the project were:\\n\\nBy the middle of 1980 the Fabrica Militar de Aviones and Dornier had a flowing relationship as a result of the combined development of the IA 63, and both contemplated a cooperation agreement for the production of future airplanes. This agreement called to both parties to establish a common office in the city of Córdoba, Argentina within the year for the production, marketing and associated support services of their products.\\n\\nThe development of a trainer was the first step of three in the strategy of Fabrica Militar de Aviones, elaborated after the development of the IA 58 Pucará by the middle of those ' 60, the steps of this strategy contemplated: Nro.1, the Pampa, Nro.2, an airplane of light transport and Nro.3, a combat airplane.\\n\\nThis way, the German maker gave some sketches of the preliminary design, which contemplated generic aspects for a combat airplane, that then the air force should adapt to its own requirements.\\n\\nThe study of the Germans foresaw some analyses that allowed to formulate those basic requirements as being: air combat under imaginary operative conditions, and characteristic of the weapons that this aircraft probably have. This way it could be defined the call of field of aerial fight.\\n\\nthumbTaking as reference the conflict in Vietnam, the combats were carried out in inferior bench marks than the 8000 mts and most pilots tried to neutralize the threat of SAM. Although in both sides they had Mach 2 airplanes, the combats got rid to speeds of among Mach 0.5 and 0.9, overcoming few times the supersonic speed.\\n\\nIt is probable that to those regimens they were achieved the best turn speed and the pilots surely found in those ranges a high yield of their airplane.\\n\\nThese parameters were taken into account in the design of the airplane to achieve high values of Mach, for what achieves a more enlarged curve of the régime of sustained turn, but the maximum values are conserved in the region transonic, in this aspect it also takes into account the load factors determined by the pilot that can define the régime of instantaneous turn.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nAccording to this analysis the margins of design of the airplane should be: sustained turn speed of Mach 0.9 at 6000m of height; great capacity of acceleration among Mach 0.9 at 1.5 to 9000 m: high deceleration, independent of the relative speed; reasonable combat autonomy with integral deposits; and minimum radar silhouettes and to IR (Stealth).\\n\\n- 1 Mauser 27mm Gun with 150 cartridges.- 2 AAM InfraRed (type AIM-9 Sidewinder)- 4 AAM radar guided located under the fuselage maybe AIM-120 AMRAAM.- Up to 5000 kg of air to surface armament.\\n\\nAir to air radar on board in way to be able to detect 5m2 targets at a distance of 90km without been detected by the enemy CME, and it should also have capacity to make the multiple pursuit of 6 targets that could be identified with an associate IFF. For the way it attacks, air-earth, was convenient a radar able to capture the profile of the earth.\\n\\nAlthough it was desirable to achieve a combination of the advantages that a very loaded wing delta and little weight offers; the turn capacity to régime transonic/subsonic of one darted with small lengthening, the stability of a wing delta without line plane and the character STOL of a wing of arrow variable, was impossible to gather all these qualities in a wing.\\n\\nThe opposing solution of commitment for the pattern, was the continuation of the border of attack of the wings that generated a vortex of high energy (apex) and it improved the aerodynamic yield notably in big angles of incidence. Another characteristic of the design was the artificial longitudinal stability that allowed equilibrating the airplane by means of the application of positive forces on the line planes.\\n\\nThis way a direct wing was configured with big arrow angles, continuations in the union wing-fuselage and a double derives located before the stabilizers that it keeps certain likeness to the F/A-18C Hornet.\\n\\nEngines: 2 turbofan of 5600kg of push (possibly GE F-404)Maximum speed: About Mach 2Weight (empty): 7.800kg\\n\\nThe weight calculated for the airship was reasonably low, achieved by means of the use of compound materials. The experience of Dornier in these materials was wide (Alpha Jet and Do 228). In the proposal for this airplane suggested the use in the wing of 65% reinforced plastics with fibers of carbon (PRFC), 20% aluminum and the rest in several materials as the titanium, the front fuselage would have 60% of PRFC, the central 18% and the bottom 10%, being completed with other materials employees in the wing, and the stabilizers would have 55% of PRFC, while the fin would take 70%, the same materials would be used for the admission nozzles and the landing train. (aeroespacio 1982/83)\\n\\nThe Fábrica Militar de Aviones estimated in about 12 to 15 years until crystallizing it from the moment the specifications they were approved, that in 1987 they were very high. In that time, the airplane would be able to replace the existent fighter fleet. The first flight of the prototype was foreseen later for 1989 and the deliveries two years later.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nBy the middle of 1980 Fábrica Militar de Aviones, it already faced serious financial difficulties, with a deficit of U$S 50 annual millions and it was in the search of partners to face diverse business that they allowed him to survive giving 49% of their property.\\n\\nIt was evident that the factory could not face the project by itself and it maintained diverse contacts, such as Aermacchi-Aeritalia, McDonnell Douglas and Fairchild, with the intention of attracting a partner with the one who to share the project.\\n\\nAlthough the intention of the air force was to add McDonnell Douglas, which maintained negotiations for a possible license of production of the A-4M Skyhawk II (now, the A-4AR Fightinghawk) and another one of ejection seats for the trainer IA 63 Pampa, but the Americans desisted of assuming the risk, because its offer of fighters was covered.\\n\\nAnother possibility was explored then with Aeritalia-Aermacchi, but the financial problems that it crossed the country they made finally shipwreck to the project.\\n\\nThe benefits for Argentina that this project would represent, as being the obtaining of machineries and technologies, and regarding structures and compound materials, such as the fibers of carbon and the titanium, they had served as industrial base to the project and Fábrica Militar de Aviones.\\n\\nthumbRole: multirole.Crew: 1, although there also would have been a 2-seat trainer version.Length: 15.53 m.Height: 3.96 m.Wing span: 10.95 m.Wing area: 30 m².Wheelbase: 6.60 m.Empty weight: 7,800 kg.Max take-off weight: 14,500 kg.Max wing loading: 266.67 kg/m².Max speed: Mach 2.25.Max climb rate: 15,000 m/min.Ceiling: 15,000 m.Range: 3380 km.Engine: 2 GE F404 turbofan.Armament: 11 hardpoints for a total of 5.000kg : 4 under the fuselage, 2 under each wing, 2 wingtip and 1 central harpoint.

{"title": "Failed suicide attempt", "body": "Failed suicide attempts comprise a large portion of suicide attempts. Some are regarded as not true attempts at all, but rather parasuicide. The usual attempt may be a wish to affect another person by the behaviour. Consequently, it occurs in a social context and may represent a request for help. The distress is misdirected: The behaviour is an act of desperation. Some suicide method have higher rates of failure than others; e.g. wrist-slashing has a much higher failure rate than use of firearms, which has only a 10% failure rate. 75% of all suicide attempts are by the use of drugs, a method that is often thwarted by using nonlethal drugs or nonlethal dosages. These people are found alive 97% of the time. There is an often-told but probably-apocryphal story of a man who failed to kill himself by hanging, poisoning, drowning, self-immolation and gunshot wound simultaneously. About one-third of people who attempt suicide will repeat the attempt within 1 year, and about 10% of those who threaten or attempt suicide eventually do kill themselves.\\n\\nFailed suicide attempts may lead to permanent injury and disfigurement, as when A.J. Reed attempted to kill himself with a shotgun and destroyed most of his face. 300,000 (or more) Americans a year survive a suicide attempt. A majority have injuries minor enough to need no more than emergency room treatment. However, about 116,000 are hospitalized, of whom 110,000 are eventually discharged alive. Their average hospital stay is 10 days; the average cost is $15,000. Seventeen percent, some 19,000, of these people are permanently disabled, restricted in their ability to work, each year, at a cost of $127,000 per person.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a study has found that after people attempt suicide and fail, their incomes increase by an average of 20.6 percent compared to peers who seriously contemplate suicide but never make an attempt. In fact, the more serious the attempt, the larger the boost—\"hard-suicide\" attempts, in which luck is the only reason the attempts fail, are associated with a 36.3 percent increase in income.\\n\\n"}

The technique handles attempts to read invalid memory by returning a manufactured value to the program, and it ignores invalid writes. This is a great contrast to typical memory checkers, which inform the program of the error or abort the program. In failure-oblivious computing, no attempt is made to inform the program that an error occurred.\\n\\nFailure-oblivious computing was developed by Martin Rinard and other researchers at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

It is typically used in an industrial environment to collect data, record and analyse system failure. A FRACAS system may attempt to manage multiple failure report that are recorded by numerous individuals in different ways. FRACAS produces a history of failure and corrective actions.\\n\\nThe FRACAS method was first introduced in the United States in the 1970s. The method calls for a systematic failure data collection, management, analysis, and corrective action implementation.FRACAS process is a disciplined closed loop failure reporting, analysis and corrective action system.The FRACAS process is a useful tool in the achievement of product reliability and safety.A Failure Reporting Analysis and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) is used to record all failures and problems related to a product or process and their associated root causes and failure analyses in order to assist in identifying and implementing corrective actions.\\n\\nOne of the most common methods for Reliability Operational Assessment is a FRACAS – a systematic approach for reliability, safety, and logistics assessment based on failure or incident reporting, management, analysis, and corrective/preventive actions.Organizations today are adopting this method (FRACAS) and utilize commercial systems such as a Web based FRACAS application enabling an organization to create a failure/incident data repository from which statistics can be derived to view accurate and genuine reliability, safety, and quality.\\n\\nCommon FRACAS outputs may include: Field MTBF, MTBR, MTTR, Spares Consumption, Reliability Growth, Failure/Incidents distribution by type, location, part no., serial no, symptom, etc.\\n\\nFRACAS - Failure Reporting Made Simple\\n\\n"}

The real Dmitry had died under uncertain circumstances, most likely an assassination attempt in 1591, at the age of nine, at his widowed mother's appanage residence in Uglich.\\n\\nThe second False Dmitry first appeared on the scene circa July 20, 1607, at Starodub. He is believed to have been either a priest's son or a converted Jew, and was relatively highly educated for the time. He spoke both the Russian and Polish language and was something of an expert in liturgical matters. He pretended at first to be the Muscovite boyar Nagoy, but confessed under torture that he was Tsarevich Dmitry, whereupon he was taken at his word and joined by thousands of Cossacks, Poles, and Muscovites. \\n\\nIn the course of the year Jerzy Mniszech, father of Marina Mniszech, widow of the first Dimitry, 'reunited' him with Marina, who miraculously recognized her late husband in this second Dimitry (subsequently quieting her conscience by privately marrying this impostor, who in no way resembled her first husband, False Dmitry I). This brought him the support of the magnate of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth who had supported False Dmitry I. Adam Wiśniowiecki, Roman Różyński, and Jan Sapieha decided to support the second pretender as well, supplying him with some early funds and 7500 soldiers, among them Aleksander Józef Lisowski, leader of the infamous mercenary band later known as Lisowczycy. \\n\\nHe quickly captured Karachev, Bryansk, and other towns, was reinforced by the Poles, and in the spring of 1608 advanced upon Moscow, routing the army of Tsar Vasily Shuisky at Bolkhov. Promises of the wholesale confiscation of the estates of the boyars drew many common people to his side. The village of Tushino, twelve verst from the capital, was converted into an armed camp where Dmitry gathered his army. His force initially included 7000 Polish soldiers, 10,000 Cossacks and 10,000 other rag-tag soldiers, including former members of the failed rokosz of Zebrzydowski. His forces soon exceeded 100,000 men. He raised to the rank of patriarch another illustrious captive, Philaret Romanov, and won the allegiance of the cities of Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Vologda, Kashin and several others. thumbThe arrival of King Sigismund III Vasa at Smolensk caused a majority of his Polish supporters to desert him and join with the armies of the Polish king. At the same time, a strong Russo-Swedish army under Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky and Jacob De la Gardie approached Tushino, forcing him to flee his camp disguised as a peasant and go to Kostroma, where Marina joined him and he lived once more in regal state. He made another unsuccessful attack on Moscow, and, supported by the Don Cossacks, recovered a hold over all south-eastern Russia. However, he was killed, while half drunk, on the 11th of December 1610 by a Tatar princeling, Peter Urusov, whom he had flogged. Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski described this event in his memoirs:\\n\\nHaving drunk deep at dinner...he ordered a sleigh to be harnessed, taking flasks of mead to the sleigh. Coming out into the open country, he drank with some boyars. Prince Peter Urusov, together with those several score horsemen with whom he was in league, was riding after him, apparently escorting him. And when the imposter had drunk very well with the boyars, Urusov drew from his holster a pistol which he had ready, and galloping up to the sleigh first shot him with the pistol, then cutting off his head and hand with his saber, took to the road.\\n\\n"}

This corresponds with Presidents Day in the United States. \\n\\nThe third Monday in February is a regular working day in British Columbia, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the territories. As Family Day is not currently recognized in the federal sphere, federal employees in all provinces (such as public servants and postal workers) still work on this day. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the third Monday of February is a school board holiday, but not an official provincial holiday.\\n\\nThe holiday was first celebrated in 1990. Alberta was the only province in Canada to have a statutory holiday in February, until it was proposed in Saskatchewan beginning in 2007.\\n\\nThe holiday was proclaimed by Lieutenant Governor Helen Hunley, on the advice of her premier, Don Getty. Premier Getty said it was important for all Albertans to take time for their families and this holiday would emphasize the importance of family values.\\n\\nGetty came in for considerable criticism at the time. Many employers felt that an additional statutory holiday was an unnecessary fiscal burden. In response to the criticism, the holiday of Heritage Day was downgraded to a civic holiday, meaning employers are not required to observe this day. Under Alberta law, the employer may choose to observe Heritage Day as a general holiday, under which rules applying to general holiday pay will be used.\\n\\nIn October 2006, Saskatchewan's Premier Lorne Calvert proposed the holiday for the province, beginning in 2007. The bill for the Labour Standards Amendment Act, 2006, was introduced in the legislature on November 1, 2006, and received Royal Assent on December 6.The act officially declares the third Monday of each February Family Day and came into effect immediately; the first Family Day in Saskatchewan was February 19, 2007.\\n\\nThe overall effect in annual days off remains unchanged for many, as Easter Monday is no longer considered a holiday by private businesses. Businesses suggested it might cost them as much as $140 million a year for this new holiday, and have requested tax breaks to soften the economic impact. The Saskatchewan government has given $95-million corporate tax cuts, but most of the companies benefiting have adjusted the official days off such that the annual allotment remains exactly the same.\\n\\nDuring the Ontario provincial election in 2007, eventual winner Dalton McGuinty of the Liberal Party promised that if re-elected premier he would establish a provincial holiday in February. On 12 October 2007, the provincial government established Family Day with the first being observed on 18 February 2008. Its creation raised Ontario's number of public holidays to nine per year.\\n\\nIn February 2007, it was reported that the Manitoba government was considering a February holiday. Legislation proclaiming the third Monday in February as Louis Riel Day was passed by Manitoba's Legislative Assembly on April 17, 2007, and first celebrated February 18, 2008. The day is known as Louis Riel Day, a name suggested by Manitoba school students, in honour of Louis Riel, the Métis leader regarded as the Father of Manitoba.\\n\\nThe provincial government of Prince Edward Island introduced Islander Day first in 2009 due to the rising trend of a holiday in February. First held on the second Monday of February in 2009, much controversy followed in most business being hurt with being out of sync with their partners in other provinces which held Family Day on the third Monday of each February; which coincided with business partners from the U.S.A which held their President's Day on the third Monday. Provincial Attorney General Gerard Greenan introduced a change to mark the holiday on the third Monday in February in April of that year.\\n\\nWith the growing trend of establishing a statutory holiday on this date, governments in the remaining jurisdictions without February holidays have come under some pressure to harmonize. Ontario's enactment of Family Day has meant the Canadian financial sector, including the Toronto Stock Exchange, largely shuts down on this date. In 2008, federal NDP leader Jack Layton proposed it be made a federal holiday.Unless and until this were to happen, federally-regulated workplaces (such as the post office) will continue to work on Family Day regardless of the day's status in the respective provinces.\\n\\nIn British Columbia, a private member's bill to establish Family Day on the third Monday in February was introduced by Liberal MLA Bob Chisholm in 1994 but failed to pass. Although there have been renewed calls to introduce Family Day in B.C. since 2007, it is opposed by the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce and the current Campbell government.\\n\\nOn September 5, 2010, while campaigning for re-election, New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham promised to establish Family Day in his province if his Liberal Party was returned to government.\\n\\n"}

For the founding faculty, Dorne recruited John Atherton, Austin Briggs, Stevan Dohanos, Robert Fawcett, Peter Helck, Fred Ludekens, Al Parker, Norman Rockwell, Ben Stahl, Harold von Schmidt and Jon Whitcomb. All were making more than US$ 50,000 a year at the time, roughly equivalent to US $425,000 in 2006. Later faculty included cartoonists Al Capp, Milt Caniff and Rube Goldberg. Advisory faculty for the school later included Stuart Davis, Ben Shahn, Fletcher Martin, Ernest Fiene, Arnold Blanch and Doris Lee. \\n\\nThe original courses offered in 1948 were Painting, Illustration/Design and Cartoon. The Cartooning course was dropped in the 1980s. The Painting and Illustration & Design courses are still offered. Each course consists of 24 lessons, with a new lesson mailed to the student upon completion of each lesson. When a student completed and returned the assignment, it was critiqued by a professional artist who sent suggestions back to the student. The original 1948 price for the two-year course was $300, payable in monthly installments, plus an estimated $11.55 for basic oil painting supplies.\\n\\nAs of 2007, the school offered four courses: Acrylic Painting; Oil and Watercolor Painting; Illustration & Design; and a Course for Talented Young People.

{"title": "Fantasy football (Association)", "body": "Fantasy football is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life players and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. Usually players are selected from one specific division in a particular country, although there are many variations.\\n\\nAn emerging variant is club-based fantasy football in which participants select players from within their own club. Participating clubs typically have more than one football team and adopt club fantasy football to increase communication and banter between teams. Some clubs charge a nominal amount for players to enter a team and either use the proceeds as a fundraiser or to fund the fantasy league prizes. Club fantasy football leagues tend to be less sophisticated than the national variety since most clubs run them on a spreadsheet. Niche sports websites now offer online versions with both paid and free versions available.\\n\\nThe original game was created by Riccardo Albini in 1990 in Italy\\n\\nFantasy football has evolved in recent years from a simple recreational activity into a significant business due to exposure via the internet.\\n\\nMost fantasy football leagues, especially those run by national newspapers, ask you to select 11 players within a price budget. There is usually a restriction on the number of players per club; a typical selection would be to select 1 goalkeeper, 4 defenders, 4 or 3 midfielders and 2 or 3 forwards. Some games are squad-based, where you choose not just a first XI but also a set of substitute.\\n\\nIn smaller leagues played by a small group of people, players are bought by bidding between the rival managers rather than for a set amount of money. This means a particular player can only play for one team, and thus any points he accrues are credited to that team only.\\n\\nTypically, most leagues offer the chance to transfer players in and out of the team as the season progresses, in case of injury, suspension or loss of form.\\n\\nPoints are then gained or deducted depending on players' performances. Points systems vary between games but typically, points are awarded for some or all of the following achievements.\\n\\nAs well as the above, points can be deducted for some or all of the following:\\n\\nThe number of points each achievement or offence is credited with varies between different games, for example in the Daily Telegraph league, three points are awarded for an assist, and five for a goal. Due to the emphasis placed on assists and goalscoring, the value of players can differ greatly from real-life football, both in terms of individuals and position. For example, Claude Makelele, a world-class central midfield player, was rarely considered a valuable player in fantasy football, owing to the fact that he was not an attacking player, as evidenced by three league goals in eight years at Real Madrid and Chelsea, and zero for the French national team in seventy-one appearances.\\n\\nThat is why some fantasy football games changed their scoring system to put greater emphasis on real player performance instead of mainly goals and assists. For instance the game KAISER uses player scores gained by computer analyses based on dozens of different criteria. These scores are supplied by the data provider OPTA.\\n\\nMost fantasy football games provides a choice of joing either private or public leagues. Public leagues are open to everybody and mostly there are leagues for each club or leagues for each country. League members then compete against each other and in some cases there is cash prizes for winning those leagues. Private leagues let manager play with their mates only. Some games combine this with having unique teams in the leagues. This means that every Premier League player exists only once. As a result, there is a lot of activity on the transfer market where players are exchanged in between the community members (timesonline.co.uk; kaiser.co.uk).\\n\\nAt the start of the season Fantasy football leagues can be set up in various ways. For leagues with unique teams, i.e. leagues where every player exist only once, there are at least two different starter options. Option 1 is a player auction. Every player is auctioned and the manager of a community need to bid for the players. Manager have a certain budget for the auction. Option 2 is a player draft. Each manager is allocated a certain number of players.\\n\\nFor leagues without unique teams, i.e. every manager can own every player if he has sufficient funding. Usually there is neither a draft nor an auction but managers can pick their players until they have used up their budget. This starter option is used by the most wide-spread fantasy football game Barclay's Premier League Fantasy Football.\\n\\nVarious fantasy football games with unique teams offer the option of a player auction. At the beginning of the season, players are put on a transfer market and manager can bid for them. Some games even continue this auction system during the season (e.g. kaiser.co.uk). Kaiser also offers the opportunity to take the league to the next season. In this case new leagues can be started throughout the season without making it less interesting. Other games with an auction system include plmanager.co.uk and fantasyleague.co.uk.\\n\\nThe draft is an option to jump-start a league. This is especially interesting for leagues that are set up during the season. From day 1, managers can line up their team for the next match day and trade players with other community member or the computer. The draft is a common feature for NFL fantasy football games and the German Bundesliga (comunio.de). At least one EPL manager game offers a similar feature (kaiser.co.uk).\\n\\nFor the NFL there are essentially two types of drafts. In a traditional \"serpentine\" (aka \"snake\") draft, owners take turns drafting players in a \"serpentine\" method, i.e. the owner who picks 1st in the odd rounds picks last in the even rounds, in the interests of fairness. In an auction draft, each owner has an (imaginary) budget which he must use to purchase all his players in an auction format. Owners take turns nominating players for open bid. The owner who bids the highest on each player receives that player (reducing their remaining budget accordingly). A few leagues use a hybrid of the two styles, selecting a portion of their roster via auction, with the remainder selected through a serpentine method.\\n\\nFootball (soccer)\\n\\n"}

The spacious Bishopsfield Road campus is less than five miles from the M27. It is next to St Jude's catholic junior school.\\n\\nStudents who require financial help with their transport costs to College can apply for assistance - which, for those cases approved, represents a firm commitment of support, unlike other Colleges that might offer free transport, but whose small print might indicate that assistance will not be given for every term of study in the year. The college's intake mainly comes from the boroughs of Fareham and Gosport, and the surrounding areas of south-east Hampshire.\\n\\nAlthough other Fareham young people study A-levels outside of the town at neighbouring sixth form colleges such as St Vincent, Itchen, Havant or South Downs College, recent data now reveals that student numbers at Fareham College have risen by over 60% over the last five years, reaching an impressive 1,700 16 to 18 year old Full Time students, with 60% coming from Fareham and surrounding areas and 40% coming from Gosport, to study vocational and traditional academic courses. There are also over 1,300 students aged over 19 at Fareham College who study a mix of classroom and 'work based learning' in very up-to-date facilities on the Bishopsfield Road campus.\\n\\nFareham College was formed in 1984 as a merger between an earlier technical college (Fareham Technical College) on the same site and the sixth-form college at the historic Price's Grammar School, a boys' grammar school on Park Lane, (before the latter's site was sold to developers) in 1984, and became the sole state provider of tertiary education in Fareham. Price's Grammar School became a sixth form college in 1976. Fareham Grammar School for Girls was on Birdwood Grove, and became Cams Hill School.\\n\\nFareham College has a reputation for its quota of vocational courses and a recent Ofsted Report (Dec08) has graded the College overall as 'Grade 2 - Good', which is a marked improvement on the Grade 3 - Satisfactory that was reported in 2005.The college has recently increased its A-level provision and now offers a total of 31 advanced level certificates. \\n\\nThe college offers a wide variety of courses including:\\n\\nThe purpose-built campus has recently updated its hairdressing & beauty therapy salons (open to the public for treatments), training kitchens and restaurant (Chequers) is open to the public for lunch and evening meals on set days of the week. Other facilities include laboratories, an air cabin crew training plane, a theatre, art and drama studios, and music and media suites, an aerospace engineering training helicopter and several motor vehicle workshops.\\n\\nThere is the 'Train to Gain' work based provision with many local and well known employers involved. The College has recently opened a new Construction Centre at the Fareham Reach Business Park on the A32 in Gosport, in response to demand for its successful and popular brickwork and other trades courses. The College is also planning a new capital build programme that will transform educational provision in the Fareham and Gosport area which will not only add to its class leading facilities, but also provide extensive resources and a venue for the communities of Fareham & Gosport. The Hair and Beauty educational provision was graded as 'Grade 1 - Outstanding' in the recent Ofsted December 08 report, with the facilities noted also as 'Outstanding' and on a far larger scale than one traditionally finds in a Further Education College.\\n\\nStudent tutorial and on site pastoral support is very strong and was similarly praised in the recent December 08 Ofsted Report as 'Outstanding' - this reassures those school leavers considering Fareham College who might feel that the College is too large for them - appropriate support but with a far greater mix of students than is possible at other Colleges; this results in an educational experience that goes way beyond the classroom in every positive sense, but ensures that the transition from school to College is as pleasant an experience as possible.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Farmer–Labor Party (United States)", "body": "The first modern Farmer–Labor Party in the United States emerged in Minnesota in 1918. Economic dislocation caused by American entry into World War I put agricultural prices and workers' wages into imbalance with rapidly escalating retail prices during the war years, and farmers and workers sought to make common cause in the political sphere to redress their grievances.\\n\\nthumb other primary contributing stream to the Farmer–Labor movement was the Labor Party movement. An International Association of Machinists strike in Bridgeport developed into a Labor Party in five Connecticut towns in the summer of 1918 and the powerful Chicago Federation of Labor (led by President John Fitzpatrick and Secretary-Treasurer Edward Nockles) adopted the cause of a Labor Party in the fall of that same year. Similar independent Labor Party movements emerged in New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Ohio, and North Dakota. These state and local organizations joined together in November 1919 in Chicago to form the Labor Party of the United States.\\n\\nOne important gathering that was a precursor to the establishment of a national Farmer–Labor Party was the Cooperative Congress, held in Chicago on February 12, 1920. The gathering included participants from the cooperative movement, farmers organizations, trade unions, and the Plumb Plan League. The congress elected a 12 person All-American Farmer–Labor Cooperative Commission. The event was closely reported in the pages of The Liberator by Robert Minor.\\n\\nIn July 1920, the Labor Party of the United States changed its name to the Farmer–Labor Party. It nominated Utah lawyer Parley P. Christensen for President of the United States. Christensen finished particularly strongly in Washington, netting over 77,000 votes in that state alone. In total, Christensen received over 265,000 votes from voters of the 19 states in which the Farmer–Labor Party was on the ballot.Also during the 1920 election, the Farmer-Labor Party candidate for the United States Senate in Washington state, C. L. France received 25% of the vote, coming in second place. This was the best performance by the Farmer-Labor Party in a state election outside Minnesota, which would soon become its main stronghold. The party's candidate for Governor of New York was Dudley Field Malone, a former Democratic Collector of the Port of New York, who achieved 69,908 votes in the state election, versus 159,804 for the Socialist candidate Joseph D. Cannon. However Rose Schneiderman, the party's candidate for U.S. Senator from New York only received 15,086 votes versus 151,246 for Socialist Jacob Panken.\\n\\nIn November 1921, as part of a lengthy world tour, Parley Parker Christensen obtained two interviews with Lenin in Moscow. The official organ of the Farmer–Labor Party was a newspaper published in Chicago called The New Majority. Editor of this paper was Robert Buck, a Fitzpatrick-Nockles loyalist.\\n\\nThe 1922 Convention of the Farmer–Labor Party was attended by 72 delegates, representing organizations in 17 states. Victor Berger, Seymour Stedman, and Otto Branstetter attended the proceedings as fraternal delegates of the Socialist Party of America. The convention decided to transform the FLP organization into a federated body of labor organizations on the model of the British Labour Party.\\n\\nThe Farmer–Labor Party sent delegates to the second conference of the Conference for Progressive Political Action, which met December 11–12, 1922 in Cleveland. The conference defeated a motion to establish an independent political party by a vote of 52–64, with the Socialist and Farmer–Labor Party delegations on the short side. At the close of the conference, the Farmer–Labor Party delegation announced that they would no longer affiliate with the CPPA.\\n\\nIn March 1923, the Farmer–Labor Party of Chicago broke away from the CPPA and decided to proceed to the immediate formation of a national Farmer–Labor political organization. Circa May, over the signature of J.G. Brown of the Farmer–Labor Party of the United States there was issued a call for a \"Monster Political Convention of the Workers of America\" to meet in Chicago on July 3. The convention call was issued to trade unions, state Farmer–Labor Parties, the Non-Partisan League, the Socialist Party, and the Workers Party, The FLP was frustrated with the timidity of the CPPA and the refusal of that organization to enter into independent electoral politics and sought to establish a national organization through other means. The Workers Party was anxious to participate in the FLP Convention as part of their United Front strategy. The Socialist Party on the other hand, was extremely hesitant. The SPA carefully considered this matter at its May 19–23, 1923, New York Convention before declining to participate in the FLP Convention, instead seeing the CPPA as the vehicle for a new Labor Party.\\n\\nIn the middle of June 1923, a subcommittee of the Central Executive Committee of the Workers Party of America met with a sub-committee of the Farmer–Labor Party. These two small groups agreed that if sufficient workers should be represented by delegates to the July 3 Conference, the Farmer–Labor Party should be supplanted by a Federated Farmer–Labor Party, and the National Committee of the Farmer–Labor Party replaced by a new National Executive Committee. The number of organizational members sending delegates necessary for the critical mass necessary to trigger this transformation was agreed by the two subcommittees to be 500,000. It was also agreed that the July 3 Conference should pass a general statement of principles and a resolution calling for the recognition of Soviet Union. If the 500,000 threshold was not achieved, an Organization Committee for the new federated FLP would instead be established.\\n\\nThe July 1923 Conference of the FLP was attended by approximately 540 delegates. The Workers Party seems to have made every effort to capture a majority at the gathering. At the convention itself, it used a disciplined caucus system, with groups of ten on the floor led by a group captain. The Workers Party delegates to the July 3 Conference were guided by a steering committee of the Central Executive Committee. During debate on the organization plan at the conference, C.E. Ruthenberg made a speech in which he asked the Farmer–Labor Party delegates what they wanted, stating that any concessions would be agreed to save the sacrifice of a federated Farmer–Labor Party itself. Five out of seven seats on the National Executive Committee of the new organization were offered to the Farmer–Labor Party. In response, the convention was adjourned and the Farmer–Labor Party delegates went into a closed caucus. This caucus returned with a resolution proposing to exclude the Workers Party from the conference and to ask the conference to accept the 1921 program and constitution of the Farmer–Labor Party without changes. This proposal was made on the floor of the conference by John Fitzpatrick of the Chicago Federation of Labor, who stated that \"it would be suicide\" to unite \"with any organization which advocated other than lawful means to bring about a political change.\" This resolution was tabled by a vote of approximately 500–40, prompting a walkout by John Fitzpatrick and a group of delegates sharing his views.\\n\\nThe Workers Party gained a majority for its program and established a \"Federated Farmer–Labor Party\" at this convention. Structural iron worker Joseph Manley, a son-in-law of William Z. Foster although a factional loyalist to John Pepper, was elected as National Secretary of the organization. The WPA's Chicago labor paper, The Voice of Labor, was turned over to the FFLP and became its official organ, The Farmer–Labor Voice.\\n\\nThe notion of a \"Federated Farmer–Labor Party\" closely paralleled the organizational ideal for a third party then currently being advanced, the Socialist Party—an organization modelled upon the British Labour Party to which political organizations (like the WPA and the SPA) might affiliate without losing their independent organizational identity. The Socialist Party sought the establishment of an American \"Labor Party\" via the CPPA—and failed. The Workers Party successfully \"captured\" the Farmer–Labor Party organization, only to lose the allegiance of the mass organizations that they with which they so eagerly desired to unite.\\n\\nA Conference of the Farmer–Labor Party was held in St. Paul on March 11–12, 1924, at which it was decided to hold its next National Convention on June 17 in that same city. A convention call was issued for that gathering, which called for farmer, labor, and political organizations to send delegates provided that they subscribed to a five point \"tentative program\" that called for public ownership, government banking, public control of all natural resources, restoration of civil liberties, and the abolition of the use of the injunction in labor disputes.\\n\\nAn effort was made by some members of the Farmer–Labor Party of the United States to merge the convention of the FLP with that of the Conference for Progressive Political Action, an attempt which was unsuccessful. This group also attempted to remove all national political parties from the convention call—the intended effect being to exclude the Workers (Communist) Party from participation. This effort failed as well.\\n\\nThere was pressure placed on the Farmer–Labor Party to purge itself of Communists and to postpone its next convention until July 4, 1924, so that it might meet jointly with that of the Conference for Progressive Political Action. On March 18, 1924, National Secretary Jay G. Brown wrote to the National Committee asking for a vote on the question of holding a convention on July 4 at Cleveland. This convention was not called. Brown resigned as National Secretary, to be replaced on a temporary basis by Robert M. Buck, who soon resigned as well. National Chairman W.M. Piggott then appointed Bert Martin as National Secretary and headquarters were moved from Chicago to Denver.\\n\\nThe June 1924 Convention of the Farmer–Labor Party (in which the Federated Farmer–Labor Party participated as a member organization) was attended by over 500 delegates representing 26 states. The convention discussed the upcoming run of Sen. Robert LaFollette, Sr. for President. LaFollette, a bitter opponent of the Workers Party of America, did not seek the endorsement of the convention, which proceeded to nominate its own candidates for President and Vice President of the United States—Duncan McDonald and William Bouck, respectively. The National Committee of the FLP met in Cleveland on July 4 and elected delegates to the Conference for Progressive Political Action. W.M. Piggott of Utah was re-elected as National Chairman and Bert Martin of Denver as National Secretary. On July 10, 1924, after the endorsement of LaFollette by the CPPA at Cleveland, a majority of the National Executive Committee withdrew the nominations of MacDonald and Bouck and pledged support to an independent campaign of the Workers Party. By the end of 1924, the Federated FLP had ceased to exist.\\n\\nThe demise of the Federated Farmer–Labor Party did not mean an end to the Farmer–Labor Party movement, however. The regular Farmer–Labor Party continued to exist at the state level, with state and local organizations in Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Illinois, Kentucky, Montana, New York, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Missouri, Washington, the Dakotas, and elsewhere. The national organization continued under the leadership of National Chairman W.M. Piggott and National Secretary Bert Miller. The group's 1920 Presidential candidate, Parley Parker Christensen, attended the Dec. 12, 1924, meeting of the National Committee of the Conference for Progressive Political Action and was made a member of the committee of arrangements for the CPPA's forthcoming February 21–22, 1925, conference. A Convention of the loyal members of the Farmer–Labor Party was called for that same time and place, where it aimed to cooperate with the CPPA in the formation of a labor party.\\n\\nThere were subsequent attempts to reconstitute a Farmer–Labor Party into the 1930s, without the participation of either the CPUSA or the Socialist Party. Frank Webb was the remnant party's candidate in 1928. For the 1932 Presidential election, Jacob Coxey campaigned as the Farmer–Labor Party candidate in a few states. In neither election did the party receive more than 8,000 votes. The Farmer–Labor Party continued to exist as a successful state party in Minnesota until 1944, when it merged with the Democratic Party of that state to form the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL).\\n\\nFolksinger and Farmer-Labor supporter Jim Garland wrote the song \"I Don't Want Your Millions, Mister,\" in which he sings, \"Take the two old parties, mister,/No difference in them I can see./But with a Farmer-Labor party,/We will set the workers free.\" \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Farmington Mine disaster", "body": "thumbThe Farmington Mine disaster was an explosion that happened at approximately 5:30 a.m. on November 20, 1968, at the Consol No. 9 coal mine north of Farmington and Mannington, West Virginia, USA.\\n\\nThe explosion was large enough to be felt in Fairmont, almost 12 miles away. At the time, 99 miners were inside. Over the course of the next few hours, 21 miners were able to escape the mine, but 78 were still trapped. All who were unable to escape perished; the bodies of 19 of the dead were never recovered. The cause of the explosion was never determined, but the accident served as the catalyst for several new laws that were passed to protect miners.\\n\\nthumbThe Consol No. 9 mine was developed in the Pittsburgh coal seam, with its main entrances at James Fork, the confluence of Little Dunkard Mill run and Dunkard Mill Run, 2 miles (3 kilometers) north of Farmington, West Virginia.() The Pittsburgh seam, is over 300 feet (100 meters) below the valley bottoms in this region, and is fairly uniform, generally about 10 feet (3 meters) thick.\\n\\nThis mine was originally opened in 1909 as the Jamison No. 9 Mine, operated by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The original entrance shafts were 322 feet deep. Even in 1909, it was noted that \"gasses are liberating\" from the coal in this mine, so that locked safety lamp were used at all times. Initially, compressed air power was used to undercut the coal, which was then blasted before horse power was used to haul the coal to the shaft, but within a year, compressed air locomotives were obtained for haulage.\\n\\nBetween 1911 and 1929, Jamison No. 9 produced over 100,000 tons per year, except in 1922, when production was just under 3000 tons. Production fell to just over 4000 tons in early 1930, after which the mine was closed for 3 years. Production resumed in 1934, climbing to over 1.2 million tons per year in 1956. On Nov. 14, 1954, an explosion ripped through the mine, killing 15 miners and leading to a temporary shutdown.\\n\\nUnder Consolidation Coal Company ownership, Coal production in 1977 was 98772 tons.\\n\\nthumbAt 5:30 a.m on November 20, an explosion shook the mine. It was so strong that a motel clerk reported feeling vibrations 12 miles away. Miners living in the area heard the noise and, knowing what it meant, headed to the mine, where they discovered a rapidly-spreading fire with flames shooting 150 feet into the air. Within hours, 21 miners made it to the surface but 78 were still trapped underground.\\n\\nThe fires continued to burn for over a week, and on November 29, rescuers finally admitted defeat after air samples from drill holes showed air unable to sustain human life. The mine was sealed on November 30 with concrete to starve the fire of oxygen.\\n\\nIn September 1969, the mine was unsealed in an attempt to recover the miners' bodies. Progress was slow because workers discovered cave-ins that they had to tunnel around. This recovery effort continued for almost ten years. By April 1978, 59 of the 78 bodies had been recovered. Unable to recover the other 19, the mine was permanently sealed.\\n\\nThe actual cause of the blast and fire was never determined. However, several contributing factors were found that may have caused the blast: inadequate ventilation, inadequate control of explosive methane gas and coal dust, and inadequate testing for methane.\\n\\nthumbThe Farmington disaster was a catalyst for the passage of major changes in the U.S. mining safety laws. One month after the Farmington disaster the U.S. Department of the Interior held a conference on mine safety. Stewart Udall's opening speech specifically referenced Farmington and concluded, \"let me assure you, the people of this country no longer will accept the disgraceful health and safety record that has characterized this major industry.\" \\n\\nAs a result of the Farmington disaster, the United States Congress passed the 1969 Coal Mine Safety and Health Act which strengthened safety standards, increased Federal mine inspections, and gave coal miners specific safety and health rights.\\n\\nStarting in 2008, student researchers from nearby Fairmont State University began a project to create a detailed account of the mine disaster by writing an all original play with the above title. Several students under the guidance of Director Dr. Francene Kirk (Associate professor of communication/theatre arts) spent the summer of 2008 conducting interviews and researching the disaster. During the course of the 2008-2009 academic year, the student researchers along with numerous other theatre majors at Fairmont State University began organizing all the information collected and devising a script. The play is devised as a museum theatre piece; that focuses on accuracy and informing the audience of an important historical event. Fairmont State University researchers and students have published and update frequently a wiki page detailing nearly every aspect of the project. The play first premiered at Fairmont State's Wallman Hall Theatre on May 1st, 2009. During the summer of 2009, student researchers and playwrights collaborated using feedback provided from the first production and revised the script for a second running of the play, which opened September 25th, 2009. The play has received great reviews by local critics, The Kennedy Center's American College Theatre Festival and those directly involved with the disaster more than 40 years ago.\\n\\n"}

The defocussing on their older areas and concentration on their new market area was welcomed by the financial market.\\n\\nFast also received a further blow when a major customer Schibsted said they had made a too risky decision in choosing to implement their own web search engine and were changing their strategy going forward. \\n\\nInvestors and customers were hoping that the company will announce new accounting and quality controls in its Q3 report to reverse the slide. However Fast on 30 October reported a loss of $100M (up from the expected $60M loss) in the quarter with another collapse of licence revenue down 55% year on year showing significant loss of software market share. The operation of the company as a software company rather than a services company was questioned by the gross margin falling to 67% from 83% a year earlier. The issues with customer non payment of bills by customers continued with $26M of debtors being written off.\\n\\nThe conduct of Fast's directors has been the subject of much comment in Norway. In Jan 2006 an article ran in the Norwegian IT paper that claimed that one of FAST's directors Tomas Fussel had made a 2000% markup for himself by buying a loss making company Hercules communications and selling it to the public company Fast 3 weeks later for a massive mark up.\\n\\nMore recently there has been controversy at the board level with one director resigning and another making public statements about other directors and major shareholders.Fast's board member Robert Keith said in a newspaper interview , \"I ought to have seen the problems in Fast earlier. And I ought to have understood that Hans Gude Gudesen is a crazy liar. Also, I ought have shot Oystein Stray Spetalen the first time I met him. That would have helped a lot of people, says the controversial Brit to the paper Finansavisen.\" Spetalen and Hans Gude Gudesen are both major shareholders in Fast. Furthermore directors Keith and Fussel are allegedly being pursued by the Norwegian tax authorities for USD 50M in unpaid taxes the government says it is owed by them. In the event of non payment liability may fall on the company.\\n\\nThe ongoing turmoil has seen 3 directors resign from the board in the last month, the latest being Johan Fredrik Odfjell who is quoted in the company's release as saying \"FAST faces many challenges and opportunities going forward\". \\n\\nOn December 22 Orkla, FAST's largest shareholder, demanded an extraordinary general meeting to force Fussel and Keith off the board.\\n\\nOn 12 December 2007 the Oslo Stock Exchange suspended trading of FAST shares. The next morning the company announced it was reviewing the accounting utilized for the 2006 and 2007 reports with a likely outcome that this would be changed. In an article titled \"Fast restates its accounts\" www.dagensit.no stated that Fast's results for 2006 and 2007 may be restated in what it called \"another clean up round.\" It also stated \"The Search technology vendor Fast Search &amp; Transfer have had several rounds with restating of accounts.\" Also after CFO Joseph Lacson some months ago declared that “everything is cleaned up”, one has found skeletons in the closet. Wednesday afternoon trading was suspended, after what the stock exchange called “certain conditions”. \\n\\nNow the company flags that they will review their accounts, both for 2006 and 2007. Fast declares that they are performing a thorough review of revenue and depreciation both for closing of 2007, and adjustments of 2006 results.\"  The shares fell around 7% on the news.\\n\\nOn 8 January 2008 it was announced that the board of Fast had unanimously accepted a $1.2 billion takeover offer from Microsoft. Microsoft has secured the backing of Fast's two largest institutional shareholder, Orkla and Hermes Focus Asset Management Europe.\\n\\nAs of 24 April 97.37% of all Fast shares are controlled by MACS Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corp. The stock was delisted from Oslo Stock Exchange May 16, 2008.\\n\\nAs more information is coming to light about the major restatement of the accounts it is being reported that Microsoft may not have completed its due diligence correctly.\\n\\nOn 26 November 2008 it was reported that FAST Search laid off 25 employees as a result of the acquisition by Microsoft.\\n\\nOn 2 December 2009, Microsoft Sells Part Of Fast Search To Rocket Software. Microsoft is selling Fast’s Folio and NXT businesses to Rocket Software; the complimentary products are application suites used by businesses to publish and index reference material onto discs, network workstations, and online.\\n\\nOn the 24th of May 2008 Norwegian news website E24.no reported that the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway had asked the police to investigate anomalies in the FAST accounts it had uncovered.\\n\\nMorning of October 13'th, Norwegian Økokrim raided Fasts offices in Oslo \\n\\nUnder scrutiny by the Norwegian police for possible fraudulent behavior prior to the FAST acquisition by Microsoft, former founder and CEO John Lervik resigned from the wholly owned Microsoft subsidiary on 23 January 2009.

{"title": "Fat-tailed Dunnart", "body": "The Fat Tailed Dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata) is a species of mouse-like marsupial of the Dasyuridae family, the family includes the Little Red Kaluta, quoll, and the Tasmanian Devil. It has an average body length of 60–90 mm with a tail of 45–70 mm. Ear length is 14–16 mm. Its weight varies between 10-20 grams, it is one of the smallest carnivorous marsupials. The tail becomes fat a few mm from the anus and right up to the tip of the tail.\\n\\nThe range of S. crassicaudata in Australia is in diverse habitats except for the Kimberley region of Western Australia and northern Northern Territory like Arnhem Land and Kakadu National Park, but avoids the Wannon and Mallee scrub habitats in Victoria. In the northeast of Victoria, the species can also be found in grass woodland and samphire shrublands. The subspecies S. c. crassicaudata is in the Epping Forest National Park in Queensland. S. c. ferruginea is found around Lake Eyre in South Australia. S. c. centralis is found in Killalpannina (as Killalpanima, Lake Eyre East), SA.Fat tailed dunnarts can be found in most deserts in Australia e.g. Simpson desert, Gibson Desert. \\n\\nThe habitats in which the species can be found include sparse grasslands, open shrublands and farmlands where there is considerable bare land. The impact of unimproved farming has been positive for this species as the type of habitat created is suitable to this dunnart's requirements, but intensive agriculture is seen as a negative factor for the species.\\n\\nThis species breeds from July to February, with the young in the pouch from July to April (Morton 1978b). Gestation is for 13 days and the young remain in the pouch for 70 days with litter size on average 7.5 with a 33% infant death rate. They generally have 2 litters per year with females not breeding for the first year. The average life span of the females is 18 months, and males 15 months.\\n\\nThe Fat-tailed Dunnart's diet includes insects such as beetles, spider larvae, small reptiles, and amphibians. It stores fat reserves in its carrot-shaped tail for times of food shortage.\\n\\nThe Fat-tailed Dunnart can survive in extreme, semi-arid environments. This is due to various physiological and behavioral characteristics. First, this marsupial is nocturnal and functions within a 24-hour circadian rhythm. During the nighttime it is protected from high temperatures that cause energy loss. While awake, it spends the majority of its time feeding. Every night it consumes approximately its own body weight of food. During periods of food shortage it decreases its duration of activity while also increasing its intensity of feeding. It uses specialized, sharp teeth to grind its prey into fine pieces. This increases its ability to obtain nutrients from its prey. It has a high rate of digestion and can use fat stored in its tail as an energy source.\\n\\nAnother survival technique that it uses is daily torpor. It lowers its body temperature and metabolic rate, in order to reduce energy expenditure. Torpor is unaffected by alterations in photoperiod but is greatly affected by environmental conditions. Two conditions must occur in order for the fat-tailed dunnart to use daily torpor: low ambient temperatures and food shortage. There are seasonal variations in torpidity. They use it more often in the winter because food is scarce and it requires more energy to maintain a high constant body temperature. During torpor, the body temperature can drop as low as 14.6 °C. This species does not use torpor for extended periods of time, thus the heart rate is variable and does not reach a steady state, such as seen in long-term torpidators. This species is unique in that it can use torpor during development and reproduction. Even during lactation a female is capable of entering daily torpor without affecting the offspring.\\n\\nCoupled with the daily torpor is a process called re-warming. The re-warming process demands a high amount of energy in order to raise the body temperature. After awaking from a torpid state, these marsupials actively seek out areas in which they can bask in the sun to aid in this process.\\n\\nNesting is also used as behavioral, survival technique. During times of cold temperatures, the fat-tailed dunnart shares nests with other rodent species such as the household mouse, ''Mus musculus,'' to conserve heat. This is unusual because the fat-tailed dunnart preys upon these mice during less extreme conditions. Group nesting is observed only during times of non-breeding.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fazal Mahmood", "body": "Fazal Mahmood (18 February 1927 – 30 May 2005) was a Pakistani cricket, regarded as the finest pace bowler of his country's early years. He played in 34 Test matches and took 139 wickets at a bowling average of 24.70. The first Pakistani to pass 100 wickets, he reached the landmark in his 22nd match.\\n\\nFazal played his earliest first-class cricket for Northern India in the Ranji Trophy and strong performances there led to selection for India's inaugural tour of Australia in 1947–48. The partition of India prior to the tour led Fazal, a Muslim, to withdraw and choose Pakistan. He played a major role in first gaining Test status for the new nation and then establishing them as a Test match team. He took ten wickets in a Test on four occasions; those against India, England and Australia coming in Pakistan's maiden victories over those teams. Fazal's most memorable performance came on the 1954 tour of England, when he had a leading role as Pakistan won at The Oval to square the series. He took match figures of 12/99, including 6/46 in the second innings as England collapsed chasing a target of 168.\\n\\nSucceeding Abdul Kardar as captain, Fazal led the national team in 10 matches between 1959 and 1961. He had immediate success against the West Indies but after losing to Australia and a stalemate with India he was sacked as captain. In all Pakistan won two Tests and lost two under his leadership. He retired from Test and first-class cricket following the 1962 tour of England when he was called-up to replace injured opening bowlers.\\n\\nBorn in Lahore, Fazal attended Islamia College from the age of 13. His father, Ghulam Hussain, was a Professor of Economics at the College as well as being president of the College's cricket club. He set Fazal a stringent training routine which involved waking at 4:30 am, walking five miles and running five miles. This schedule was adhered to for seven years. Fazal made the College first team in his second year and at the age of 15 took 5/13 in a inter-college final, a record for the tournament.\\n\\nIn March 1944, Fazal, aged 17 and still at college, made his first-class debut for Northern India. In a Ranji Trophy match against Southern Punjab he batted at number eleven scoring 38 not out and taking three wickets. His maiden first-class wicket was that of India Test all-rounder Lala Amarnath. In Fazal's second appearance, a semi-final against Western India, he claimed eight wickets including 6/65 in the first innings.\\n\\nAfter a quiet 1944–45 season, in which Fazal took five wickets at 18.20, his performances the following season almost led to a place on the 1946 tour of England. Playing in the Zonal Quadrangular Tournament, a competition which acted as a trial for the tour, he opened the bowling for North Zone with Amarnath and took match figures of 9/83. Indian captain Nawab of Pataudi wanted Fazal in the squad but he was considered too young by the other selectors. On the tourists return home they played two matches against a Rest of India XI, Fazal took seven wickets in the first match which the Rest won but was expensive in the second. Later in the 1946–47 season his batting abilities were displayed when he scored his first and only first-class century. Playing for North Zone he scored exactly 100 not out from number eight, sharing in a 207-run seventh wicket partnership with Gogumal Kishenchand. North Zone won the match comfortably with Fazal contributing six wickets. He took a further five wickets in the final but North Zone lost by an innings. The zonal tournament had again acted as a trial, on this occasion for the country's inaugural tour of Australia in 1947–48. Fazal was included in the squad and attended the training camp, however before the tour began partition intervened and as a devout Muslim Fazal withdrew.\\n\\nThe maiden first-class match in the newly formed country took place on 27 December 1947 between Punjab and Sind. Fazal played for Punjab, taking six wickets and scoring 60 in an innings victory. The match was the first time that Fazal opened the bowling alongside Khan Mohammad, his future new ball partner for Pakistan. The first international visitors to Pakistan were West Indies in November 1948. The last of three fixtures was against a representative side which contained Fazal, he failed to take a wicket in a drawn match. At the end of the 1948–49 season Pakistan toured Ceylon for four matches, Fazal was the leading wicket-taker with 20 wickets. On the return tour a year later he took 16 wickets in two matches.\\n\\nA MCC side toured the subcontinent in 1951–52, playing a number of fixtures in Pakistan. In the first match against Punjab they were nearly forced to follow on after Fazal took 5/58. The fifth and final match of the tour was against a Pakistan side on a coir matting wicket at Karachi, Fazal exploited the surface to return figures of 6/40 in the MCC's first innings. The hosts went on to win by four wickets, a victory that played a large part in Pakistan gaining Test status. Pakistan were made Test members on 28 July 1952, less than five years after independence.\\n\\nIn October 1952, Pakistan began their first Test series against India. Fazal made his Test debut in the first match at Delhi, taking 2/92 in India's first innings, his maiden wicket was Indian captain, Lala Amarnath. Pakistan were dismissed cheaply twice to lose by an innings, Fazal was the only Pakistani player to reach double figures in both innings. Pakistan reversed the result in the second Test at Lucknow, played on a jute matting pitch Fazal took 5/52 in the first innings and 7/42 in the second as Pakistan won by an innings in only their second ever Test. His match figures of 12/94 are the best by a Pakistani bowler away from home, and were the best by any bowler against India until 1980. In the third Test at Bombay Fazal was wicketless as Pakistan lost by ten wickets, although in their first innings he scored 33 batting at number eight, helping Pakistan recover from 60/6 to 143/7. The final two Tests of the series were drawn, Fazal took six further wickets to finish his maiden series as Pakistan's leader wicket-taker with 20 at 25.60. He also made some lower order contributions finishing with a series total of 173 runs at 28.83.\\n\\nA Pakistan Eaglets side, containing Fazal, was sent to England in 1953 in preparation for the following year's tour of the country. While in England, Fazal received coaching from retired England and Surrey fast bowler Alf Gover.\\n\\nFazal was made vice-captain to Abdul Kardar for the 1954 tour which would prove a success for both player and team on their first series outside the subcontinent. Fazal began the tour well, taking 11/102 and scoring 67 in the tourists first match against Worcestershire. He continued to take wickets in the lead up to the Test series, and also demonstrated his ability to bowl long and economical spells particularly against Oxford University where he bowled 37 maidens in 68 overs taking 7/95 in the process.\\n\\nThe first Test at Lord's was heavily affected by rain and drawn, batting was difficult in the play that was possible and Pakistan were dismissed for 87 in their first innings. England in response scored 117/9 declared with Fazal and Khan Mohammad bowling throughout the innings, Fazal recording figures of 4/54. In the tour match before the next Test Pakistan played Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, the tourists won by eight wickets with Fazal taking 11 wickets including a then career best 8/66 in the first innings. The second Test was at the same venue but saw contrasting fortunes as the Pakistanis suffered a heavy innings defeat and Fazal recorded his worst Test figures of 0/148. Although he was suffering with a leg injury which forced him to shorten his run-up. Pakistan faced another innings defeat after three days of the third Test but the match was drawn after rain stopped any play on the final two days, Fazal took 4/107 from 42 overs in England's innings.\\n\\nPakistan went to the fourth and final Test at The Oval 1-0 down but caused a major upset by beating England to level the series, it was the first occasion that a country had won a Test in England on their inaugural tour. Fazal played a leading role in the victory claiming match figures of 12/99. In England's first innings he bowled throughout taking 6/53 from 30 overs, Wisden wrote the figures 'would have been much better but for dropped catches'. In a low scoring match, England were set a target of 168 in their second innings. Despite the early loss of Len Hutton, for the second time in the match caught behind off the bowling of Fazal, at 109/2 England looked well set on the fourth evening. However Fazal took the wickets of Peter May, Godfrey Evans and Denis Compton before the close and the next day took the first two wickets to fall as Pakistan completed a 24-run victory. Fazal's finished with second innings figures of 6/46 from 30 overs.\\n\\nIn the series Fazal took 20 wickets, 12 more than the next best Pakistani bowler, at an average of 20.40. He played in only one of the six first-class matches that concluded the tour but still finished as leading wicket-taker with 77 at 17.53. In recognition of his feats, Fazal was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1955, the first Pakistani to be honoured. \\n\\nPakistan's first home series came in the 1954–55 season with the visit of India for five Test matches. The series was marked by defensive and dull cricket with all five matches being drawn, the first occurrence of this in Test history. Fazal played in four of the matches and took 15 wickets at 21.93. His best figures came in the fifth Test at Karachi where he took 5/48 in India's first innings.\\n\\nLater in 1955 New Zealand made their maiden tour to the country, Pakistan completed a first Test series victory, winning 2-0. Fazal played in two of the three Tests and took five wickets at 18.40.\\n\\nAustralia was the next visitors to Pakistan, touring in October 1956 for a single Test prior to their series in India and following the tour of England. In the match at Karachi, Pakistan secured a historic victory in their first Test against Australia. Fazal played a major role in the win, taking Test best figures of 13/114. He took the first six wickets to fall in Australia's first innings leaving the tourists on 52/6, a position they failed to recover from, they were 80 all out. He also took the first four wickets in the second innings and finished with 7/80. Wisden described his technique: \"maintaining an accurate length and varying his swing with a mixture of leg-cutters and breakbacks\". Imtiaz Ahmed said that: \"Fazal never wavered in length and direction, and he moved the ball both ways intelligently...For one whole over from Fazal in the first innings, even the great Miller had no clue.\"\\n\\nPakistan's tour of the West Indies in 1958 was marked by a number of high scoring Test matches and Fazal had a large workload, sending down over 320 overs in the five Test series including 186 in consecutive Tests. Pakistan lost the series 3-1 and only avoided defeat in the first Test thanks to the 16 hour innings of 337 by Hanif Mohammad. In the second Test at Trinidad Fazal was Pakistan's most economical bowler collecting six wickets in the process, while as batsman he scored 60 from number 10, his highest Test score and only fifty at international level. The third Test at Kingston was historic as Gary Sobers scored 365 not out, breaking the Test record for highest individual score. Injuries to fellow opening bowler Mahmood Hussain and spinner Nasim-ul-Ghani meant that Fazal sent down 85.2 overs, what Wisden described as 'a phenomenal number of overs for a bowler of his pace'. Fazal conceded 247 runs in the innings and took the only two wickets to fall. Fazal's bowling analysis places him fifth in Test history for most overs bowled and most runs conceded in an innings. Pakistan lost the Test by an innings and by losing the next match in Guyana they lost the series. Pakistan achieved a consolation victory in the fifth Test, Fazal taking 6/83 in the first innings including the wicket of Conrad Hunte with the first ball of the match. Fazal finished the series with 20 wickets at 38.20, despite being one of his worst in terms of average, he was still Pakistan's leading wicket-taker.\\n\\nBy the time of the return tour the following year, Abdul Kardar, captain of Pakistan since their Test election, had retired from Test cricket. Fazal, the nation's leading bowler, succeeded him in the role. In his first Test as captain he won the toss and decided to field, opening the bowling he took the wicket of Conrad Hunte in the first over for the second successive Test. Fazal finished the innings with figures of 4/32 which also included dismissing Gary Sobers for a duck. Fazal took three further wickets in the second innings including both Hunte and Sobers, the latter's wicket was Fazal's 100th in Test cricket, the first Pakistani to reach the landmark. Pakistan completed a ten wicket victory to give their new captain a winning start. Pakistan also won the next Test at Dhaka and therefore completed a series win in the three match rubber. In a low scoring match Fazal played an instrumental role, taking ten wickets in a match for the fourth time in Tests. Put in to bat, Pakistan recovered from 22/5 to make 145. West Indies fared worse, being dismissed for 76 following a collapse of six wickets for 11 runs. Fazal bowled throughout the innings, taking 6/34. West Indies, set 214 in their fourth innings, fell 41 runs short. Fazal taking six of the first seven wickets, the other dismissal that of Sobers by Mahmood Hussain involved Fazal as the catcher. Mahmood finished off the tail to claim four wickets while Fazal ended with figures of 6/66 and a match analysis of 12/100. The latter were the best figures by a bowler whilst captain until 1993, when bettered by Waqar Younis. The third Test, a dead rubber, was won by the West Indies. Fazal dismissed both openers but these were his only wickets in 40 overs. He was the leading wicket-taker in the series with 21 at 15.85.\\n\\nAustralia toured Pakistan at the end of 1959 for a three Test series which they won 2-0, Pakistan's first series defeat at home. In the first Test at Dacca the tourists won by eight wickets, Fazal claimed six wickets including a first innings five-for, 5/71. He missed the second Test at his home city of Lahore, wicket-keeper Imtiaz Ahmed taking over captaincy duties in a match Australia won by seven wickets. Fazal returned for the third Test in Karachi and took another five wicket haul with 5/74 in Australia's first innings. Pakistan gained a lead on first innings but after three early wickets their second innings slowed and the match petered out to a draw. Despite missing a match Fazal was Pakistan's leading wicket-taker for the series, taking 11 at 19.36.\\n\\nPakistan toured India during the 1960–61 season but with little reward as all 15 matches on their tour, including five Tests, were drawn. Just as seven years previous, the series contained dour and defensive cricket as both sides appeared intent on avoiding defeat rather than attempting to win. Fazal won the toss in the first four Tests but only in the third Test at Eden Gardens did Pakistan gain a first innings lead. In that match Fazal took 5/26 off 25.3 overs, but he failed to take a wicket in India's second innings as they batted out time comfortably. Apart from that five-for, his 13th and last in Test cricket, Fazal took only four other wickets in the series. Fazal's captaincy received severe criticism with accusations of favouritism, and following the final Test he was sacked as captain.\\n\\nFazal wasn't initially selected by Pakistan for the home series against England but returned for the final Test. He was as economical as ever, conceding 98 runs from his 63 overs, but failed to take a wicket. He wasn't included in the 1962 tour squad to England but was called up as a replacement when fast bowlers Mahmood Hussain and Mohammad Farooq broke down injured. The five match series already lost, Fazal came into the team for the fourth Test at Trent Bridge. He shouldered much of the workload, bowling for all but 30 minutes of the second day and continuing throughout on the third morning until the England declaration, from his 60 overs he took 3/130. In the fifth Test at The Oval, he was expensive taking 2/192 from 47 overs, the two wickets, which proved to be his last in Test cricket, were those of Colin Cowdrey (182) and Ted Dexter (172).\\n\\nAfter leaving Islamia College with a Master's degree in Economic, Fazal joined the Pakistan Services as an inspector of Police in 1947 rising to Deputy Superintendent in 1952 and Deputy Inspector General in 1976.\\n\\nFazal suffered a fatal heart attack at his Lahore residence on 30 May 2005. His friend and former team-mate Hanif Mohammad described Fazal as a \"great human being\" and \"the doyen of Pakistan bowlers in the country's formative years\".\\n\\nFazal married the daughter of Mohammad Saeed, Pakistani cricket's first captain.\\n\\nFazal was the first bowler in the history of Test cricket to take 12 or more wickets in a Test match against four different countries, those being India, England, Australia, and West Indies.He reached 100 Test wickets in 22 Tests, of Pakistan bowlers only Waqar Younis and Mohammad Asif reached the landmark quicker.\\n\\n"}

It was he who issued the fatwa in favour of Jihad against the English in 1857. \\n\\nFazl-e Haq was one of the pioneer freedom fighters deported to the Andaman Islands in 1859. After the First War of Independence failed, he was arrested on 30 January 1859 at Khairabad, was found guilty of \"revolt\" against the Government and sentenced for life to the prison at Kalapani (Cellular Jail) with confiscation of his property by the Judicial Commissioner, Awadh Court. He reached Andaman on 8 October 1859 aboard the Steam Frigate “Fire Queen”.\\n\\nShams-ul-Haq, the son of Fazal Haq, somehow managed to obtain the release order of his father.

The crusade never took place. \\n\\nThere are contemporary accounts of the banquet (notably the Memoirs of Olivier de la Marche, and the Chroniques of Mathieu d'Escouchy), which name and describe in much detail the lavish entertainments staged during the meal and various pieces of music performed at it, perhaps including Dufay's motet Lamentatio sanctae matris ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae. At one point in the show, according to the chronicles, an actor dressed as a woman in white satin clothes, personifying the church of Constantinople (according to one hypothesis, played by Olivier de la Marche himself) entered the hall of the banquet riding on an elephant, led by a giant Saracen, to recite a \"complaint and lamentation in a piteous and feminine voice\" (\"commença sa complainte et lamentacion à voix piteuse et femmenine\"), requesting aid from the Knights of the Golden Fleece. It has been surmised that this was the moment when Dufay's motet would have been performed; other authors have conjectured that it was merely a moment of inspiration and that the motet was actually written later.\\n\\nWe are also told which music by Gilles Binchois was performed and of 24 musicians playing inside an enormous pie and a trick with a horse riding backwards.\\n\\nThe oath taken by the participants, the Vœux du faisan (\"oath of the pheasant\") was in the tradition of the \"bird oaths\" of Late Medieval France as popularized in the 14th century romance of the Voeux du paon.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Federalist No. 8", "body": "200pxFederalist No. 8 is an essay by Alexander Hamilton, the eighth of the Federalist Papers. It was published on November 20, 1787 under the pseudonym Publius, the name under which all the Federalist Papers were published. In it, Hamilton argues for the utility of the Union to the well-being of Americans, specifically addressing the negative consequences if the Union were to collapse and conflict arise between the states. It is titled, \"Consequences of Hostilities Between the States.\"\\n\\nIf the states do not unify into a single nation there will be a perpetual cycle of conflict between neighboring states. Their alliances or dis-unions create circumstances similar to European nations, where the cycle of aggression between neighboring nations creates the need for domestic armies and fortifications. Additionally, if not unified populous states, motivated by greed might plunder weaker states for their resources.\\n\\nThe motivation for a union is safety, being aware though that no matter how great the nation's commitment to liberty freedoms are compromised in order to achieve protection. The physical damage of armed conflict compels nations to implement a military deterrent and in doing so an overly militaristic culture diminishes the civil and political rights of the people. \"To be more safe, they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.\"\\n\\nThe new Constitution does not prohibit standing armies and it's inferred that a perpetual army will exist. The frequency of conflict and the need for defense will necessitate a ready armed force for defense. And by its nature a militaristic state strengthens the executive arm (from which a monarchy could emerge). War increases executive authority at the expense of the other branches of government.\\n\\nExtreme defense would likely give rise to oppressive government practices.\\n\\nObserving history; the livelihood of citizens cause the population to be ill suited for war. A varied workforce necessitates the development of a profession of soldiers who would be distinct from the body of the citizens.\\n\\n\"The military state becomes elevated above the civil.\" Nations that don't have a full-time army are less likely to oppress citizens. The leaders of nations prone to invasion must maintain defensive forces, however frequently this militarism infringes upon the citizen's rights or weakens their sense of entitlement of those rights; the continental nations of Western Europe were examples of this.\\n\\nAlso, a Union of states would act as a deterrent from aggression by nearby Foreign colonies.\\n\\n08Federalist No. 08\\n\\n"}

The show itself closely resembles its predecessor, Lord of the Dance. However Feet of Flames doubles the dancers, adds new numbers, and a new stage with multi-level tiers for the dancers. Amongst the new numbers is Flatley's solo — \"Feet of Flames\", which the show is based around. The show introduced some of the key elements that are now featured when Flatley performs. His silver-heeled shoes made by Freed's of London were used for the first time in this show. TV screens on both sides of the stage were also installed and now used in all the shows that feature Flatley. Film of the Hyde Park show was later distributed on VHS and DVD.\\n\\nOn September 21, 1999 Michael Flatley announced a Feet of Flames world tour for 2000. This tour began on Wednesday, March 1, 2000, in Germany. The show differed significantly from the original 1998 version. The show had new numbers, new leads, a new story line and a \"whole new outlook\" in the words of Flatley. Both the original female leads Bernadette Flynn and Gillian Norris were replaced by Sarah Clark and Leigh Ann McKenna. Daire Nolan was replaced by Stephen Brunning. Both Daire Nolan and Gillian Norris went on to pursue their own careers after the 1998 show. Bernadette Flynn left to dance with Lord of the Dance troupe one until 2001. Some of the characters changed slightly in the show. Lord of the Dance became Firespirit, Saroise became The Swan and Morrighan the Temptress became Cleopatra. The Dark Lord was remained but never used Don Dorcha as the name. Helen Egan's part as the little spirit became the Court Jester in the World Tour. The Highlight of the 2000 tour was Flatley and the Troupe performing in Budapest to over 100,000 people. The European part of the 2000 World Tour concluded on July 29, 2000 in Stormont Castle, Belfast, Northern Ireland.\\n\\nThe 2001 tour, dubbed the \"USA Victory Tour\", had a preview show on June 6, 2001 in the Bi-Lo Center, Greenville, South Carolina. The tour officially began on June 8, 2001 in the AmericanAirlines Arena, Miami, Florida. The highlight of the tour was Michael Flatley performing for the first time in Madison Square Garden in New York City on June 29, 2001. The Victory Tour ended on July 29, 2001 in Dallas, Texas in the American Airlines Center, the second event to be held at the venue. The last time Feet of Flames was performed with Michael Flatley was July 29, 2001. Michael Flatley was said to have retired that night but later in 2005 would come out with a new show — Celtic Tiger.\\n\\nFeet of Flames will return to the world stage with lead dancers Damien O' Kane and Bernadette Flynn leading the helm whileMichael Flatley did not dance for the first time in this show. This show used the 1998 Hyde park version instead of the World Tour version. At this point in time it will be a two-week tour in Taiwan. It is possible Flatley is testing the waters to see if this tour will be successful. Future tours may follow.\\n\\nIn 2009, Michael Flatley reprised his role in the 2009 tour held in the Taipei Arena in Taipei, Taiwan. It was filmed for DVD and later released as said in his website. It was also released in Amazon.com later in 2010\\n\\nthumbThe Feet of Flames show from Hyde Park in 1998 was put on VHS and DVD. There were rumours about the 2000 and 2001 World Tour version of the show being put out on DVD. The Budapest show in 2000 was recorded for an actual full show DVD release. For an unknown reason however this never happened, instead clips of the show were put on Michael Flatley's autobiography/concert DVD Michael Flatley Gold. Included on the DVD are the numbers:\\n\\nThe show was also recorded at certain venues during the 2001 Victory Tour in the USA. The Madison Square Garden show on June 29, 2001 in New York City as well as the American Airlines Center show on July 29, 2001 in Dallas, Texas were recorded. The American leg of the tour was filmed for an IMAX planned for release in 2002. In addition parts of the footage were going to be used in a film featuring Michael Flatley. The working title for the film was supposedly \"Dream Dancer\", a fictional love story. Clips of the rehearsal process for the movie can be found on Michael Flatley Gold. The film was, however, never completed. The original film from the shows in allegedly tied up in ownership dispute between the filming company and Michael Flatley's company Unicorn Entertainment.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumb\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fei Yi", "body": "Fei Yi (died 253), style name Wenwei (文偉), was an official of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history. He succeeded Jiang Wan as regent of Shu Han.\\n\\nFei Yi was from Jiangxia Commandery (in present-day eastern Hubei). His father died when he was still young and he was raised by his distant relative Fei Boren (費伯仁), who was a cousin of the warlord Liu Zhang, who controlled Yi Province (present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). Sometime around 211, Liu Zhang sent messengers to welcome Fei Boren to his domain, and while Fei Boren himself appeared to have turned down the invitation himself, he sent Fei Yi to Yi Province. Fei Yi remained in Yi Province after Liu Bei conquered it in 214. He became known as a young scholar. He and Dong Yun were long-time friends, and both served together as Liu Shan's assistants after Liu Bei declared himself emperor in 221 and made Liu Shan crown prince. After Liu Shan succeeded to the throne in 223, Fei Yi continued to serve him.\\n\\nIt is not clear how Zhuge Liang, Liu Shan's regent, got to know Fei Yi's abilities, but by the time that Zhuge Liang returned from his southern campaign against the tribes of modern Guizhou and Yunnan, he had seen that Fei Yi was the most capable of the young officials. He frequently commissioned Fei Yi to serve as an ambassador to Eastern Wu, and during those missions, Eastern Wu's emperor Sun Quan became impressed with Fei Yi as well. Zhuge Liang continued to promote Fei Yi through a progression of offices during his regency. When not on missions to Eastern Wu, Fei Yi served as one of Zhuge Liang's military strategists.\\n\\nAs an official serving under Zhuge Liang, Fei Yi was known for his easy-going nature and desire to keep his colleagues away from conflicts. When Wei Yan and Yang Yi had their frequent struggles against each other, Fei Yi stayed neutral and tried to reconcile them. Fei Yi, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in trying to prevent them from boiling into an open armed conflict after Zhuge Liang's death in 234 (which resulted in Wei's death), but during Zhuge Liang's life he was able to keep them working together.\\n\\nWhen Zhuge Liang became ill on his final campaign against Cao Wei in 234, Liu Shan sent messengers to inquire him as to who should succeed him. Zhuge Liang recommended Jiang Wan, and Fei Yi as Jiang Wan's eventual successor. After Zhuge Liang's death later that year, Jiang Wan became regent, and Fei Yi became his chief assistant.\\n\\nAs the chief assistant to the regent Jiang Wan, Fei Yi handled mostly domestic matters. He was described as so quick in his comprehension and decisions that he only needed mornings to carry out his duties, and he spent the afternoons entertaining guests. He was particularly skillful at playing weiqi. When Dong Yun succeeded him in 243 in that role, he tried to follow Fei Yi's schedule, but after several days, the paperwork quickly backlogged, forcing him to work all day. He thus became amazed at Fei Yi's amazing abilities.\\n\\nJiang Wan was often in ill-health, and in 243 he transferred most of his authorities to Fei Yi and Dong Yun while remaining regent. In 244, when Cao Wei's regent Cao Shuang attacked the important border city Hanzhong, it was Fei Yi who led the troops against Cao Shuang and dealt Wei a major defeat. After Jiang Wan's death in 245, Fei Yi became regent.\\n\\nOne near-immediate task that Fei faced was finding a chief assistant for himself, as Dong Yun, who had been serving in that role since 243, died soon after Jiang Wan's death. He decided on the general Jiang Wei. However, as both he and Jiang Wei were largely involved with military matters, the domestic matters soon apparently fell into the hands of Huang Hao, a eunuch described to be treacherous and corrupt, but was trusted by Liu Shan. The effective administration that Zhuge Liang had created and Jiang Wan had continued began to deteriorate, although the key effects would not be visible during Fei Yi's regency.\\n\\nAs regent, Fei Yi was not as non-aggressive militarily as Jiang Wan, but he did not resume the full-scale military confrontations that Zhuge Liang advocated and carried out. He had Jiang Wei harassed Cao Wei's borders with periodic attacks, but never authorized Jiang Wei to launch an all-out assault.\\n\\nOne major characteristic that Fei Yi was known and admired for was his easy-going nature. That might, however, have caused his death. As he was hosting a feast at his mansion for key officials, one of the guests was Guo Xun (郭循), a Cao Wei general whom he had captured in 250, who was still secretly loyal to Cao Wei. Guo Xun, after most people became drunk, took the opportunity to assassinate Fei Yi. The historian Yu Xi (虞喜) commented, \"Fei Yi was so open and honest and so unworried about others, and he was eventually assassinated by Guo Xun, a surrendered man. Is it not that his fault came from his virtues?\" Fei Yi was given the posthumous name Jing (敬侯, literally, \"alert\" or \"honorable\"), which, however, appeared to be inappropriate.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fenian Brotherhood", "body": "thumbThe Fenian Brotherhood was an Irish republican organization founded in the United States in 1858 by John O'Mahony and Michael Doheny. It was a precursor to Clan na Gael, a sister organization to the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Members were commonly known as \"Fenians\". O'Mahony, who was a Celt scholar, named his organization after the Fianna, the legendary band of Irish warriors led by Fionn mac Cumhaill.\\n\\nThe Fenian Brotherhood trace their origins back to 1798 and the United Irishmen, who had been an open political organization only to be suppressed and became a secret revolutionary organization, rose in rebellion, seeking an end to British rule in Ireland and the establishment of an Irish Republic. The rebellion was suppressed, but the principles of the United Irishmen were to have a powerful influence on the course of Irish history.\\n\\nFollowing the collapse of the rebellion, the British Prime Minister William Pitt introduced a bill to abolish the Irish parliament and manufactured a Union between Ireland and Britain. Opposition from the Protestant oligarchy that controlled the parliament was countered by the widespread and open use of bribery. The Act of Union was passed, and became law on 1 January 1801. The Catholics, who had been excluded from the Irish parliament, were promised emancipation under the Union. This promise was never kept, and caused a protracted and bitter struggle for civil liberties. It was not until 1829 that the British government reluctantly conceded Catholic emancipation. Though leading to general emancipation, this process simultaneously disenfranchised the small tenants, known as ‘forty shilling freeholders’, who were mainly Catholics.\\n\\nDaniel O’Connell, who had led the emancipation campaign, then attempted the same methods in his campaign, to have the Act of Union with Britain repealed. Despite the use of petitions and public meetings which attracted vast popular support, the government thought the Union was more important than Irish public opinion. thumb In the early 1840 the younger members of the repeal movement, became impatient with O’Connell’s over-cautious policies, and began to question his intentions. Later they were what became to known as the Young Ireland movement. In 1842 three of the Young Ireland leaders, Thomas Davis, Charles Gavan Duffy and John Blake Dillon, launched the Nation newspaper. In the paper they set out to create a spirit of pride and an identity based on nationality rather than on social status or religion. Following the collapse of the Repeal Association and with the arrival of famine, the Young Irelanders broke away completely from O’Connell in 1846.\\n\\nThe blight that destroyed the potato harvest between 1845 and 1849 was an unprecedented human tragedy. An entire social class of small farmers and labourers were to be virtually wiped out by hunger, disease and emigration. The laissez –faire economic thinking of the government ensured that help was slow, hesitant and insufficient. Between 1845 and 1851 the population fell by almost two million. \\n\\nThat the people starved while livestock and grain continued to be exported, quite often under military escort, would leave a legacy of bitterness and resentment among the survivors. The waves of emigration because of the famine and in the years following also ensured that such feelings would not be confined to Ireland, but spread to England, the United States, Australia and every country where Irish emigrants gathered.\\n\\nShocked by the scenes of starvation and greatly influenced by the revolutions then sweeping Europe, the Young Ireland moved from agitation to armed rebellion in 1848. The attempted rebellion failed after a small skirmish in Ballingary, Co Tipperary, coupled with a few minor incidents elsewhere. The reasons for the failure were obvious: the people were totally despondent after three years of famine, and being prompted to rise up early resulted in an inadequacy of military preparations, which caused disunity among the leaders. \\n\\nThe Government quickly rounded up many of the instigators. Those who could fled across the seas, and their followers dispersed. A last flicker of revolt in 1849, led by among others James Fintan Lalor, was equally unsuccessful.\\n\\nJohn Mitchel, the most committed advocate of revolution, had been arrested early in 1848 and transported to Australia on the purposefully created charge of Treason-felony. He was to be joined by other leaders, such as William Smith O'Brien and Thomas Francis Meagher who had both been arrested after Ballingary. John Blake Dillon escaped to France, as did three of the younger members, James Stephens, John O'Mahony and Michael Doheny.\\n\\nAfter the collapse of the '48 rebellion James Stephens and John O'Mahony went to the Continent to avoid arrest. In Paris they supported themselves by teaching and translation work and planned the next stage of \"the fight to overthrow British rule in Ireland.\" In 1856 O'Mahony went to America and founded the Fenian Brotherhood in 1858. Stephens returned to Ireland and in Dublin on St. Patrick's Day 1858, following an organizing tour through the length and breadth of the country, founded the Irish counterpart of the American Fenians, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. \\n\\nIn the United States, O'Mahony's presidency over the Fenian Brotherhood was being increasingly challenged by William R. Roberts. Both Fenian factions raised money by the issue of bonds in the name of the \"Irish Republic,\" which were bought by the faithful in the expectation of their being honored when Ireland should be \"a nation once again\". These bonds were to be redeemed \"six months after the recognition of the independence of Ireland.\" Hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants subscribed.thumbLarge quantities of arms were purchased, and preparations were openly made by the Roberts faction for a co-ordinated series of raids into Canada, which the United States government took no major steps to prevent. Many in the U.S. administration were not indisposed to the movement because of Britain's failure to support the Union during the civil war. Roberts' \"Secretary for War\" was General T. W. Sweeny, who was struck off the American army list from January 1866 to November 1866 to allow him to organize the raids. The purpose of these raids was to seize the transportation network of Canada, with the idea that this would force the British to exchange Ireland's freedom for possession of their Province of Canada. Before the invasion, the Fenians had received some intelligence from like-minded supporters within Canada but did not receive support from all Irish Catholics there who saw the invasions as threatening the emerging Canadian sovereignty. \\n\\nThe command of the expedition in Buffalo, New York, was entrusted by Roberts to Colonel John O'Neill, who crossed the Niagara River (the Niagara is the international border) at the head of at least 800 (O'Neill's figure; usually reported as up to 1,500 in Canadian sources) men on the night and morning of 31 May/1 June 1866, and briefly captured Fort Erie, defeating a Canadian force at Ridgeway. Many of these men, including O'Neill, were battle-hardened veterans of the American Civil War. In the end the invasion had been broken by the US authorities’ subsequent interruption of Fenian supply lines across the Niagara River and the arrests of Fenian reinforcements attempting to cross the river into Canada. It is unlikely that with such a small force that they would have ever achieved their goal. \\n\\nOther Fenian attempts to invade occurred throughout the next week in the St. Lawrence Valley. As many of the weapons had in the meantime been confiscated by the US army, relatively few of these men actually became involved in the fighting. There even was a small Fenian raid on a storage building that successfully got back some weapons that had been seized by the US Army. Many were eventually returned anyway by sympathetic officers.\\n\\nTo get the Fenians out of the area, both in the St. Lawrence and Buffalo, the US government purchased rail tickets for the Fenians to return to their homes if the individuals involved would promise not to invade any more countries from the United States. Many of the arms were returned later if the person claiming them could post bond that they were not going to be used to invade Canada again, although some were possibly used in the raids that followed.\\n\\nIn December 1867, O'Neill became president of the Roberts faction of the Fenian Brotherhood, which in the following year held a great convention in Philadelphia attended by over 400 properly accredited delegates, while 6,000 Fenian soldiers, armed and in uniform, paraded the streets. At this convention a second invasion of Canada was determined upon; while the news of the Clerkenwell explosion was a strong incentive to a vigorous policy. Henri Le Caron, who, while acting as a secret agent of the British government, held the position of \"Inspector-General of the Irish Republican Army,\" asserts that he distributed fifteen thousand stands of arms and almost three million rounds of ammunition in the care of the many trusted men stationed between Ogdensburg, New York and St. Albans, Vermont, in preparation for the intended raid. It took place in April 1870, and proved a failure just as rapid and complete as the attempt of 1866. The Fenians under O'Neill's command crossed the Canadian frontier near Franklin, Vermont, but were dispersed by a single volley from Canadian volunteers; while O'Neill himself was promptly arrested by the United States authorities acting under the orders of President Ulysses S. Grant. Yet another attempt and failure would take place in 1871 near the Red River in Manitoba.\\n\\nThe Fenian threat prompted calls for Canadian confederation. Confederation had been in the works for years but was only implemented in 1867, the year following the first raids. In 1868, a Fenian sympathizer assassinated Irish-Canadian politician Thomas D'Arcy McGee in Ottawa for his condemnation of the raids. \\n\\nFear of Fenian attack plagued the Lower Mainland of British Columbia during the 1880s, as the Fenian Brotherhood was actively organizing in Washington and Oregon, but raids never actually materialized . At the inauguration of the mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, photos taken of the occasion show three large British warships sat in the harbor just off the railhead and its docks. Their presence was explicitly because of the threat of Fenian attack or terrorism, as were the large numbers of troops on the first train.\\n\\nDuring the latter part of 1866 Stephens endeavored to raise funds in America for a fresh rising planned for the following year. He issued a bombastic proclamation in America announcing an imminent general rising in Ireland; but he was himself soon afterwards deposed by his confederates, among whom dissension had broken out.\\n\\nThe Fenian Rising proved to be a \"doomed rebellion,\" poorly organized and with minimal public support. Most of the Irish-American officers who landed at Cork, in the expectation of commanding an army against England, were imprisoned; sporadic disturbances around the country were easily suppressed by the police, army and local militias.\\n\\nAfter the 1867 rising, IRB headquarters in Manchester opted to support neither of the dueling American factions, promoting instead a new organization in America, Clan na Gael. The Fenian Brotherhood itself, however, continued to exist until voting to disband in 1880.\\n\\nIn 1881, the submarine Fenian Ram, designed by John Philip Holland for use against the British, was launched by the Delamater Iron Company in New York.\\n\\n"}

He has performed solo and been involved with a number of bands spanning a variety of musical genres.\\n\\nNagell's first exposure to metal music came when he was three years old and received Uriah Heep's album Sweet Freedom from his uncle for his birthday. At the age of five, he would fashion belts for himself out of paper in an imitation of those worn by Mick Box. Other musical interests of his 10 first years included rock and heavy metal groups such as The Doors, Grand Funk, Steppenwolf, The Byrds, Elvis, Kiss, Ac/Dc, Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath\\n\\nDarkthrone was created as a primitive punk metal band by the name of Black Death in 1986. Later, in late 1987, Fenriz formed Darkthrone and got involved in a group called Valhall, which practiced in his basement. Fenriz has expressed that he had a passive interest in Bathory by 1986, but claims that he did not understand the \"darkness\" of black metal until hearing a song by the Hungarian band Tormentor in 1989 (he gives similar credit to Mercyful Fate). The same year, Fenriz left Valhall in order to concentrate on Darkthrone. He also started a solo death metal, later viking metal project entitled Isengard, for Darkthrone was at the time a band that opposed stylistic progression and change. Fenriz's solo ambient project Neptune Towers served as an example of his varied musical tastes. It was followed by another quintessential contribution to the folk metal scene with Storm.\\n\\nFenriz now claims to be apolitical, remaining non-partisan towards the events of early Norwegian black metal. In one interview, Fenriz stated that he was against the book Lords of Chaos, comparing its hype to Oprah. Fenriz prefers to keep Darkthrone out of the spotlight; in late 2004 he turned down a nomination for a Norwegian Alarm Award. He claimed that Darkthrone had \"no interest in being part of the glitter and showbiz side of the music industry\". Fenriz is known for his refusal to play live, his obsessiveness about music listening, supporting other underground bands and his lack of interest in the mainstream music business in general. Fenriz is one of the focal characters in the 2009 documentary film Until The Light Takes Us (filmed in early 00s).\\n\\nFenriz currently lives in the outskirts of Oslo, and had a record label with Nocturno Culto called Tyrant Syndicate Productions, which was a sub-label of Peaceville Records (to which Darkthrone is signed). In late 2004, Fenriz released a compilation album through Peaceville entitled Fenriz Presents... The Best of Old-School Black Metal, which included selected tracks from such influential artists as Celtic Frost, Hellhammer, Burzum, and Bathory. He is a Dj and has made several online music compilations.\\n\\nNote: All albums are with Darkthrone, unless noted otherwise. This does not include minor guest appearances.\\n\\n"}

He is most famous for his studies of the Kannada language and for producing the first ever Kannada-English dictionary of about 70,000 words in 1894.

As a missionary, he endeavoured to follow Paul's first Epistle to the Corinthians and \"become as an Indian unto the Indians\", and undertook exhaustive studies learning the Kannada language, customs and local music. This earned rebuke from the Basel Mission, where he was already an outsider on account of his North German origin and academic education (the other missionaries such as were chiefly from southwest Germany and the lower/middle classes), though Gottfried Weigle had studied at Tubingen. This marginalised him by pushing him to a remote station in the Nilgiris and later confining him to the mission's press in Mangalore.

As Grand Master in Malta he raised the towns of Żabbar, Żejtun and Siġġiewi to the status of cities.\\n\\nIn 1798 Hompesch was warned that the French fleet which was sailing to Egypt intended to attack Malta as well. Hompesch disregarded the warning and took no action to reinforce the islands defences. On June 6, 1798, the advance squadron of the French fleet reached Malta. One ship was permitted to enter the harbour for repairs. On June 9 the main fleet arrived. The French commander Napoléon Bonaparte had a force of 29,000 men against Hompesch's 7,000. Bonaparte demanded free entrance to the harbour for the entire fleet with the excuse to get water provisions. Hompesch replied that only two ships at a time could do so. Napoleon saw it as a provocation and ordered the invasion of the Maltese Islands.thumbOn June 10 the French fleet began disembarking. The French forces were supported by a local insurrection of Maltese, many of whom wished to get rid of the Knights. The rules of the Order prohibited fighting against Christian and many of the French members of the order did not want to fight against the French forces. Hompesch capitulated on June 11. The following day a treaty was signed by which the order handed over sovereignty of the island of Malta to the French Republic. In return the French Republic agreed to \"employ all its credit at the congress of Rastadt to procure a principality for the Grand Master, equivalent to the one he gives up\". Hompesch was also given an annual pension.\\n\\nHompesch left Malta for Trieste on 18 June. He resigned as Grand Master on July 6, 1799. In 1804 he went to Montpellier in France where he died one year later of asthma. He is buried in the Church of Sainte Eulalie in Montpellier.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fernán Caballero", "body": "Fernán Caballero (24 December 1796, Morges, Vaud – 7 April 1877) was the pseudonym adopted from the name of a village in the province of Ciudad Real by the Spanish novelist Cecilia Francisca Josefa Böhl de Faber.\\n\\nBorn at Morges in Switzerland, she was the daughter of Johann Nikolaus Böhl von Faber, a Hamburg merchant, who lived long in Spain, married a native of Cádiz, and is creditably known to students of Spanish literature as the editor of the Floresta de rimas antiguas castellanas (1821–1825), and the Teatro español anterior a Lope de Vega (1832). Educated principally at Hamburg, she visited Spain in 1815, and, unfortunately for herself, in 1816 married Antonio Planells y Bardaxi, an infantry captain of bad character. In the following year Planells was killed in action, and in 1822 the young widow married Francisco Ruiz del Arco, marqués de Arco Hermoso, an officer in one of the Spanish household regiments.\\n\\nUpon the death of Arco Hermoso in 1835, the marquesa found herself in straitened circumstances, and in less than two years she married Antonio Arrom de Ayala, a man considerably her junior. Arrom was appointed consul in Australia, engaged in business enterprises and made money; but unfortunate speculations drove him to commit suicide in 1859. Ten years earlier the name of Fernán Caballero became famous in Spain as the author of La Gaviota. The writer had already published in German an anonymous romance, Sole (1840), and curiously enough the original draft of La Gaviota was written in French. This novel, translated into Spanish by José Joaquín de Mora, appeared as the feuilleton of El Heraldo (1849), and was received with marked favor. Eugenio de Ochoa, a prominent critic of the day, ratified the popular judgment, and hopefully proclaimed the writer to be a rival of Walter Scott. No other Spanish book of the 19th century has obtained such instant and universal recognition. It was translated into most European languages, and, though it scarcely seems to deserve the intense enthusiasm which it excited, it is the best of its author's works, with the possible exception of La Familia de Alvareda (which was written, first of all, in German).\\n\\nLess successful attempts are Lady Virginia and Clemencia; but the short stories entitled Cuadros de Costumbres are interesting in matter and form, and Una en otra and Elia o la Espana treinta años ha are excellent specimens of picturesque narration. It would be difficult to maintain that Fernán Caballero was a great literary artist, but it is certain that she was a born teller of stories and that she has a graceful style very suitable to her purpose. She came into Spain at a most happy moment, before the new order had perceptibly disturbed the old, and she brought to bear not alone a fine natural gift of observation, but a freshness of vision, undulled by long familiarity. She combined the advantages of being both a foreigner and a native.\\n\\nIn later publications she insisted too emphatically upon the moral lesson, and lost much of her primitive simplicity and charm; but we may believe her statement that, though she occasionally idealized circumstances, she was conscientious in choosing for her themes subjects which had occurred in her own experience. Hence she may be regarded as a pioneer in the realistic field, and this historical fact adds to her positive importance. For many years she was the most popular of Spanish writers, and the sensation caused by her death at Seville on the 7th of April 1877 proved that her truthfulness still attracted readers who were interested in records of national customs and manners.\\n\\nHer Obras completas are included in the Colección de escritores castellanos: a useful biography by Fernando de Gabriel Ruiz de Apodaca precedes the Últimas producciones de Fernán Caballero (Seville, 1878).\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ferranti Sirius", "body": "Ferranti's Sirius was a small business computer released in 1961. Designed to be used in smaller offices without a dedicated programming staff, the Sirius used decimal arithmetic instead of binary, supported Autocode to ease programming, was designed to fit behind a standard office desk, and ran on U.K. standard 230 V mains electricity with no need for cooling. It was also fairly slow, with instruction speeds around 4,000 operations per second, and a main memory based on delay lines, but as Ferranti pointed out, its price/performance ratio was difficult to beat.\\n\\nDuring the 1950s there was widespread interest in the use of magnetic amplifier as a solid state switching device. The amplifiers used the saturation points and hysteresis curves of a magnetic core to sum a number of inputs and settle to a single output state. The various logical functions were achieved by linearly adding the input signals on control lines and generating an output signal if the sum exceeded a fixed threshold, defined by the saturation property of the magnetic core. This process came to be known as \"Ballot Box Logic\" due to the way the inputs \"voted\" on the output. One difference between magnetic logic and conventional tube or transistor systems is that it is the current that defines the logic levels, not voltage.\\n\\nSince the magnetic cores were open in the middle, any number of control lines could be threaded through them. This was particularly useful when implementing a \"best two out of three\", a common logic circuit used in binary adders. Another possibility is to use the same core as the switching element in several different portions of the machines logic. For instance, a single core could be used as part of the system that reads instructions from memory, and then again as part of the ALU, as long as both functions don't operate at the same time (as they would in an instruction pipeline).\\n\\nInterest in magnetic amplifiers lasted only a short time through the 1950s. When they were first being studied, transistor were expensive and unreliable devices, but the introduction of new manufacturing techniques in the late 1950s started to address both of these problems. In spite of their other advantages, magnetic amplifiers quickly disappeared as transistor based logic became increasingly common, and only a few computers based on these systems were produced.\\n\\nOne group working on the magnetic amplifier design was Gordon Scarrott's team at Ferranti R&D labs in West Gorton, Manchester. This team had a longstanding partnership with Manchester University, after commercializing the Manchester Mark 1 and several follow-on designs.\\n\\nAs the prices of transistors dropped, Ken Johnson, an engineer at the lab, proposed a new type of transistor-based logic that followed the same conventions as the magnetic amplifiers, namely that binary logic was based on well known currents instead of voltages. Like the magnetic amplifiers, Johnson's \"Neuron\" design could be used to control several different inputs. Better yet, the system often required only one transistor per logic element, whereas conventional voltage-based logic often required two or more. Although transistors were falling in price they were still expensive, so a Neuron based machine might offer similar performance at a much lower price.\\n\\nInterest in Neuron was high, and the team decided to build a small machine to test it, known as \"Newt\", for \"Neuron test\". This machine was successful, and the lab was so impressed that they decided to expand the testbed into a complete computer. The result was the Sirius, which was much less expensive than similar machines using traditional transistor logic. Sirius was announced on 19 May 1959 with claims that it would be the smallest and most economically priced computer in the European market. The Sirius was marketed in England for ₤20,000, a deal compared to its competitors, the Elliott 803 at ₤35,000 and the ICT 1301 at ₤120,000 pounds. About 20 were produced in total.\\n\\nConvinced that Neuron was a major advance, Ferranti R&D proposed a much larger machine based on the same logic, one that would have even greater price advantages over traditional designs. The new machine was aimed at the business market, not their traditional high-performance niche, and Prudential plc signed up as a launch customer while several other large insurance firms followed. Emerging as the Ferranti Orion in 1961, the system proved to be a disaster. As the machine was much larger than the Sirius physically, it had longer wire runs and thus required larger currents to operate the Neurons. Electrical noise and settling times were major issues, and Orion was much slower than promised.\\n\\nEngineers at other Ferranti offices were concerned about the Neuron-based design from the start, but were never able to convince management to stop the effort. When Orion failed, these teams were able to convince Prudential that they could deliver a machine five times as fast at the same price point within three years. A ground-up redesign using traditional transistor logic followed and emerged in 1964 as the Orion 2. However, the losses caused by the Orion project were too great for management's taste, and the computer divisions had already been sold off to International Computers and Tabulators in October 1963.\\n\\nThe Sirius was based on decimal numbers stored as 4 binary digits each, a useful design for many tasks that the Neuron circuits allowed to be implemented inexpensively. Numbers were stored as a string of ten decimal digits in one of eight accumulator, along with a parity bit. The computer words could also be used to store half of a double-length number, or five characters.\\n\\nThe accumulators were backed by what Ferranti called a \"single-level store\", a main memory formed out of a series of torsional delay line memory elements storing 50 words each. Machines were normally supplied with 1,000 words, but this could be expanded through additional cabinets with 3,000 words each to a reach a total of 10,000 words. Normally the first 200 words were used to store library routines.\\n\\nThe instruction set was a single-address format stored in single decimal digits of a word, containing a 6-digit address, a 2-digit instruction code, and 1-digit specifying the \"A\" and \"B\" accumulators. In most instructions the contents of the B register and the memory location were processed and output to A. For instance, instruction \"01\" added the contents of the address to B, then subtracted that result from the existing contents of A, writing the result back to A. As the Sirius used decimals for storage, the system offered a number of instructions that quickly multiplied the input or output by 10, by shifting the numbers in the accumulators. The Sirius was also supplied with a version of Autocode adapted from the Ferranti Pegasus, and Autocode programs from the Pegasus could be run on the Sirius \"with very little alteration.\"\\n\\nThe computer operated at 500 kHz, but because each digit was stored as 4 bits, the basic word operational cycle was 80 microseconds. The ALU was serial, so addition or subtraction took 240 microseconds, and overall processing speed was about 4,000 operations a second. General multiplication or division took between 4 and 10 milliseconds, averaging 8. Although this is relatively slow, even for the era, Ferranti boasted that \"The Sirius computer is nearly twice as fast as any other existing computer at its price, both as regards speeds of input and output and speeds of computation.\"\\n\\nOperator input was provided in the form of a box with 10 columns of digits in the center with buttons for each number from 0 to 10. A single column on the left was used to select an accumulator, and the other then to input the ten digit value. There was a row of command keys on the right. Output consisted of two ten-digit displays using nixie tubes on the front of the machine, which also featured a large electric clock.\\n\\nAll machines were also supplied with a Ferranti TR5 or TR7 photo-electric paper tape reader that read at 300 characters a second, and a slower Teletype paper tape printer (no speed is given, likely 110). Further input/output was offered through two input and two output channels, normally connected to a five-way switch box that allowed the operator to select which devices were fed to which channels. Magnetic tape, punched card, printer and other common I/O devices were supported through these channels.\\n\\nThe machine was designed to fit into small offices with a minimum of support. It required 5 amps of standard 50 Hz 230 V mains power, the only concern being that it was \"free from excessive fluctuations.\" The case was only 10 inches deep, 4 foot 9 inches high, and 6 foot 9 inches across. This size was chosen to allow it to be placed directly behind a standard office desk, and the power supply was positioned so it projected into the knee-hole area. The reader and input box were normally placed on the desk, while the paper tape punch, a relatively large machine, was separate and sized to provide an even desktop.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ferrymead Railway", "body": "thumbThe Ferrymead Railway is a New Zealand heritage railway built upon the formation of New Zealand's first public railway, the line from Ferrymead to Christchurch, which opened in 1863. On the opening of the line to Lyttelton on 9 December 1867, the Ferrymead Railway became the Ferrymead Branch and was closed shortly thereafter. In 1964, rail enthusiasts began relaying track on the historic formation and the Ferrymead Railway officially opened in 1977. It now operates steam, diesel and electric trains regularly and is recognised throughout as one of the most significant rail preservation sites in New Zealand.\\n\\nThe original line was built to the Canterbury Provincial Railways broad gauge of  to suit rolling stock imported from the Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company in the Australia state of Victoria. It serviced ships which docked at the Ferrymead wharf. Construction of the Lyttelton rail tunnel to the port of Lyttelton was in progress: when this was finished in 1867, the line to Ferrymead became a branch and thereafter carried little traffic. After 27 July 1868, the line was used simply as a siding, by which time the Ferrymead station buildings had been relocated to Christchurch and Heathcote (station). It therefore holds the interesting distinction of being the first railway in New Zealand to be both opened and closed.\\n\\nThe Museum of Science and Industry, as it was then called, began in Christchurch in the early 1960s when a group of like-minded individuals banded together to set up a pilot project at Garvins Road in Hornby. At that time the Canterbury Branch NZRLS applied to the New Zealand Railways Department to lease part of the old Southbridge Branch at Prebbleton. When this was turned down, Ferrymead became a serious possibility. The Museum of Science and Industry and the Canterbury Branch decided that the historical Ferrymead site was ideal as a base for its operations. The centenary of the original line was commemorated in 1963 and the beginnings of the present Ferrymead Railway date to November 1964.\\n\\nIt was decided that the plans for the site, which was later named Ferrymead Historic Park, should include both railway and tram tracks, the latter operated by the Tramway Historical Society, linking the entrance with a historical village development. The Canterbury Branch started construction of the Ferrymead Railway with the necessary infrastructure and facilities including the workshop, engine shed, stations, signalling systems and other facilities. The Railway began to operate trains during 1972 and was officially opened in 1977. Up to that time, locomotives and rolling stock were transported to the site by truck. In 1978, the track was extended to permit a temporary connection with the New Zealand Railways main line near Heathcote, and this permitted the largest locomotives, the Vulcan railcars and other rolling stock to enter the Ferrymead site. The arrival of the Vulcans, the first real example of economical diesel motive power, allowed Saturday services and steam substitution to become a reality.\\n\\nDuring the late 1970s, construction began on the electrified section of the railway, using materials and equipment obtained from the former electric mainlines between Christchurch and Lyttelton, and Arthur's Pass and Otira. Following the withdrawal of the DG class diesel-electric locomotives by NZR in 1983, a separate society, the Diesel Traction Group, was formed to preserve one of the class at Ferrymead and subsequently purchased DE and DI class members. In 1988, the Ferrymead Railway was an integral and key part of the Ferrymead 125 anniversary celebrations, which saw passenger train shuttles operated daily direct between Christchurch and Ferrymead via a mainline connection, returning via Lyttelton. Locomotives and rolling stock also left Ferrymead by rail to participate in other parts of the rail festival, including several mainline excursions. DM and D class electric multiple units from Wellington arrived at Ferrymead just after the 125 Festival.\\n\\nIn 1990 there was another steam festival in conjunction with the New Zealand sesquicentennial, as well as a Vulcan Railcar tour of the South Island using RM 51 and RM 56. Also in that year, the NZRLS Canterbury Branch was reconstituted as the Canterbury Railway Society. Restructuring of New Zealand Railways, which had begun in the early 1980s, resulted in the closure of various local railway facilities and produced further opportunities for the Canterbury Railway Society to acquire additional equipment. Changes in employment law and its consequent effect on New Zealand society after 1990 had major impacts on nearly every railway preservation organisation in New Zealand in terms of voluntary labour supply. The economic recession of 1991 also had its effect upon the Society. Ferrymead Heritage Park was also in financial trouble as a result of the economic downturn and a dropoff in Park visitors. This era ushered in a number of changes for rail preservation groups including the introduction of new safety systems under the Land Transport Safety Authority.\\n\\nIn 1995, Ferrymead Historic Park was taken over by the Christchurch City Council when its financial losses became unsustainable. Since that time there have been a number of changes in the way that the Park is run, with a greater reliance on voluntary labour. The Ferrymead Railway now operates a more limited running season to take into account the reduction in visitor numbers during the winter months and to allow for track and rolling stock maintenance as required. A feature of recent years has been the Waipara Vintage Festivals held every second year from 1995. Ferrymead Railway and Diesel Traction Group locomotives and carriages have participated in each of these steam-based festivals, held on the Weka Pass Railway, except for the 2003 event.\\n\\nIn 2005 plans for a National Rail Museum were revealed. Construction of the first stage will cost approximately $3.5 million. Other plans include the electrification between Moorhouse and Ferrymead stations, and extending the line from Moorhouse to a new Valley Station.\\n\\n"}

On that night, several major rock groups performed at an outdoor festival in front of an audience of over 200,000 people.\\n\\nThe event was named Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro (Festival of Rock and Wheels) because the event was originally supposed to be a sponsored car race with rock bands. Somebody advised the car racer Eduardo Lopez Negrete to include ambient music. The organizers decided to consult Armando Molina for further advice. Molina suggested including twelve bands and helped organize the event.\\n\\nThe concert occurred in the Valle de Bravo, a lakeside resort in Avándaro, near the city of Toluca, Estado de Mexico, two-hours from Mexico City. The concert brought thousands of young people together in peace to share and enjoy the music. The Festival took place in the aftermath of the 1968 massacre of Tlatelolco, and was under the threat of government repression. At the end of what became known as the \"Mexican Woodstock\", the government helped evacuate stranded attendees en masse. As a result of the festival, rock music was suppressed in Mexico for several decades.\\n\\nThe sons of then State of Mexico Governor Carlos Hank Gonzalez, from the PRI, attended and fostered the Festival.\\n\\nSome events were filmed by Telesistema Mexicano (today Televisa) but the footage remains missing.

{"title": "Fiddler (comics)", "body": "The Fiddler is a fictional character, a DC Comics supervillain and a recurring foe of the first Flash (Jay Garrick). He first appeared in All-Flash #32 (December 1947 - January 1948).\\n\\nThe Fiddler's history was changed somewhat in the Crisis on Infinite Earths.\\n\\nThe Fiddler started out as a thief who was arrested in India and sent to jail. While in prison, he met a fakir, charming a snake in his cell, who taught him the \"mystic art\" of Indian music. For the next five years, he learned the fakir's secret and made a crude violin made of material he can scrounge in the prison. He developed the ability to use his violin to play sounds that could either hypnotize others, shatter objects, or create barriers. After the fakir declared his student had surpassed him, he used the instrument to hypnotize the guards to open their cells and he and the fakir escaped. He then murdered the fakir and the merchant who had him arrested in the first place.\\n\\nReturning to America, the Fiddler, as he called himself, made his first stop at Keystone City. While the Fiddler managed to humiliate the Flash (Jay Garrick) the first time they met, Flash was able to foil his plan, which involved replacing Maestro Bowin, a violin virtuoso, who was actually the Fiddler's twin brother. The physical similarity between the brothers (who had been separated at birth) also led to Bowin briefly being suspected of the Fiddler's crimes.\\n\\nSince then, he continued to plague Flash I again and again. He was a member of the original Injustice Society.\\n\\nLater, the Fiddler was part of a trio of criminals that caused the original Flash to come out of retirement. The Fiddler, along with The Shade and The Thinker were stopped by the first of many team ups of Earth One and Earth Two heroes in the classic \"Flash of Two Worlds\" story from Flash (volume I) #123 (September 1961). Barry Allen, the Earth-1 Flash, visited Earth-2 accidentally and looked up his comic book hero, the original Flash. Together, the two Flashes stopped the villains. This issue led to many other team ups between Earth-1 and Earth-2 heroes and villains. \\n\\nThe Fiddler uses a fiddle to control those around him. He travels around in his Fiddle Car, which Jay Garrick recognizes by sight.\\n\\nThe son of British aristocrats, Isaac Bowin had a talent with music, and an impulse to travel. Running out of money, he resorted to theft and robbery to make ends meet until he was arrested in India and sent to jail. He then met a fakir, much as in the pre-Crisis version.\\n\\nReturning to America and taking on a new identity, that of the Fiddler, Bowin made his first stop at Keystone City. The main difference between this new origin and the original story is that he was aware Maestro Bowin was his twin and wanted to ruin his brother's good name. He continued to plague Jay Garrick for many years, eventually joining with the Thinker and the Shade to remove Keystone City from the world's vision and memory. Barry Allen inadvertently crossed the vibrational barrier the Fiddler created in Grant Morrison's post-Crisis version of the first Jay/Barry team-up, \"Flash of Two Cities\" in Secret Origins #50 (Aug 1990). As in the original story, the two Flashes defeated the villains together.\\n\\nDuring the 1986 DC mini-series Legends, the people of America are turned against heroes, and a law was made that no one could operate legally wearing a costume. \\n\\nFor the Fiddler this period proved an opportune time to join with his old comrade the Wizard in his new Injustice Society, now called Injustice Unlimited. They overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in Calgary, Canada, namely Infinity, Inc. and a contingent of the Global Guardians. They forced the heroes to help in some mayhem. The Fiddler took Obsidian and the Green Flame to London and, with their help, stole a very prized Stradivarius violin. They then returned to Calgary to share in the stolen wealth being gathered by the Wizard but the plan went haywire when Hourman (Rick Tyler) revived and freed himself, as well as when Solomon Grundy was brought in from the Arctic Circle. It was Hourman who incapacitates the Fiddler by destroying the Stradivarius, and after the confusion he was taken into custody by Canadian law enforcement.  \\n\\nIn John Ostrander's Hawkworld series, it was revealed that the fakir who taught Bowen his hypnotic skills was actually a demon. The Fiddler apparently dies in that story, but has resurfaced since (possibly through the machinations of the demon Neron since Fiddler first reapperad alive in Neron's assembly of supervillains in Underworld Unleashed #1). The same demon would turn a heavy-metal guitarist into a 1990s version of the Fiddler called the Thrasher. The Thrasher was defeated by Hawkman, and has not reappeared. It is not clear if this version of the Fiddler's origin is still in continuity.\\n\\nAn Iowa Bowin, claiming to be the Fiddler's great-grandson, appeared in Flash 80-Page Giant #2, in a story set in the future. Although his guitar-based version of his great-grandfather's powers initially caused chaos, he wished to be a hero, working alongside Kid Flash (Iris West).\\n\\nIn the first issue of the Infinite Crisis miniseries Villains United, the Fiddler has joined the Secret Six. Disappointed by the Fiddler's performance against H.I.V.E. agents during their first mission, Mockingbird deems him \"incompetent\" and orders him killed. Deadshot carries out the execution, and the Fiddler was replaced by Catman. The Fiddler's violin is later found to be in the possession of Virtuoso, a woman allied with the Secret Society. Most recently though, a man resembling the Fiddler makes a cameo in Green Arrow/Black Canary shown upset in room filled with violins destroyed by a recent fight between Green Arrow, Black Canary, and a mugger outside\\n\\nFiddler has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the Hall of Justice. He is one of many dead super-villains reanimated as members of the Black Lantern Corps. He features prominently as a Black Lantern during a short story-arc running through the one-shot revival issue of Suicide Squad, and the following two issues of Secret Six. The Fiddler is apparently destroyed.\\n\\nThe Fiddler possesses magical abilities that he channels through his violins. The musical vibrations he creates can shatter solid objects, create force-fields and hypnotize others due to the sheer amount of sub-level bass.\\n\\nHe uses violins gimmicked with weapons such as blades and guns.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Field Notes from a Catastrophe", "body": " \\n\\nField Notes from a Catastrophe: Man, Nature, and Climate Change is a 2006 non-fiction book by Elizabeth Kolbert. The book attempts to bring attention to the causes and effects of global climate change. Kolbert travels around the world where climate change is affecting the environment in significant ways. These locations include Alaska, Greenland, the Netherlands, and Iceland. The environmental effects that are apparent consist of rising sea levels, thawing permafrost, diminishing ice shelves, changes in migratory patterns, and increasingly devastating forest fires due to loss of precipitation. She also speaks with many leading scientists about their individual research and findings. Kolbert brings to attention the attempts of large corporations such as Exxon Mobil and General Motors to influence politicians and discrediting scientists. She also writes about America’s reluctance in the global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Leading this resistance, she explains, is the Bush administration which has been opposed to the Kyoto protocol since it was ratified in 2005. Kolbert concludes the book by examining the events surrounding the events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and arguing that governments have the knowledge and technologies to prepare for such disasters but choose to ignore the signs until it is too late. In a sense, Field Notes from a Catastrophe is Kolbert’s way of saying “Wake up, the Earth is at stake here.”\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nKolbert visits Shishmaref and Fairbanks, Alaska, to speak with both the townspeople and scientists about the effect global warming is having in Alaska. In Shishmaref, towns are being forced off of the coastal regions because ice that had once protected these towns from storms and large waves, have melted. In Fairbanks Kolbert met with scientist Vladimir Romanovsky to study how global warming is affecting the permafrost levels in Alaska. Romanovsky’s research shows that as permafrost melts it releases carbon dioxide, which has been trapped in the permafrost for thousands of years and is harmful to the environment. Kolbert also discusses the spectrometer used by Donald Perovich on the expedition, Des Groseilliers. The spectrometer was used to measure the light reflected off of the ice and snow. The discovery that the snow reflected more than the ocean is important because the ocean is being heated by global warming and melting the ice which is making the water levels rise.\\n\\nThis section explains the history of researchers exploring human influence on climate change. At the beginning, it states that global warming is not a fad because it has been researched since the mid-19th century. John Tyndall was the first to research global warming; he did this by creating the first Spectrophotometer. This is an instrument used to measure the absorptive properties of gases. Through his research of gases, he discovered what is today called “The Greenhouse Effect.” The Greenhouse effect is the absorption and retention of heat from radiation. After the death of John Tyndall, Svante Arrhenius took over his position as the main researcher of global warming. He was the first to connect industrialization to climate change and even today NASA scientists credit him with insightful predictions: “His understanding of the role of carbon dioxide in heating Earth, even at that early date, led him to predict that if atmospheric carbon dioxide doubled, Earth would become several degrees warmer.” After the death of Arrhenius, most scientists believed that if  levels were rising at all, they were rising very slowly. In the mid-1950s, Charles David Keeling found a more precise way to record  levels and began recording the data. He brought us the Keeling Curve which shows the steady rise of  levels since 1958.\\n\\nKolbert travels to a research station in Greenland called Swiss Camp that was set up in 1990 and built into the ice floe. Kolbert meets Konrad Steffan, the director of Swiss Camp, who studies the meteorological conditions on the ice sheet at the equilibrium line (the point at which winter snow and summer snow melt are supposed to be exactly in balance). Steffan’s research shows that the glacier have been melting faster (at a rate of 12 cubic miles per year), creating much more flooding in the area during the warmer months. These glaciers contain vast amounts of fresh water, which, when melted into the salt water of the oceans, begins to change ocean current patterns, thus resulting in some places around the world becoming colder and some becoming warmer. From obtaining ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet, it has been found that the average temperatures have risen twenty degrees within the past ten years thus resulting in the beginning of the disintegration of the entire Greenland ice sheet, which will be impossible to stop. It has also been found that rapid warming has occurred in the past, which then proceeded to fall into ice age conditions. In November 2004, there was a study presented in Reykjavik, Iceland, that explained how the Arctic climate is warming and the U.S. responded by stating they would effectively take action to combat the problem but would not make it an obligation. The scientists studying the situation have seen how humans have become the dominating factor in influencing climate change; in the professional world, global warming is not necessarily thought to be a natural process.\\n\\nThis chapter describes Kolbert's interviews with scientists from around the world who have conducted experiments to prove that climate change inevitably affects many organisms' genetic structures and habitats. Kolbert attempts to reveal that global warming is the cause for these events. She interviews three biologists, Chris Thomas, William Bradshaw and Christina Holzapfel, and one paleoecologist, Thomas Web III. Kolbert follows scientific observations based upon the studies of the Comma Butterfly, the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii, the Golden Toad and pollen grains, among many other studies. Kolbert is concerned with the frightening reality that if species are being genetically changed and on the verge of extinction that the availability of our natural resources for future will be in jeopardy.\\n\\nKolbert visits GISS, a former branch of NASA, which analyzes and produces various geographic models to demonstrate the behavior of the atmosphere, land surfaces, and ice sheets. According to GISS, more and more drought are being triggered, which we aren’t able to adapt to with our way of living. This problem also arose in ancient civilizations, such as with the Maya and in the city of Shekhna, when they reached their technological peak. The ancient city of Shekhna in present-day Syria has shown evidence that the culture died from drought. Kolbert cites scientific evidence based on geological models that chart the geographic downfall of other ancient civilizations that have experienced climate change. During ancient times, however, the technology had yet to be developed and they did not have the proper scientific abilities to adapt to extreme changes like massive drought. Kolbert argues that we may be technologically advanced, but as we continue to progress, we are becoming more and more destructive to the environment as well.\\n\\nIn chapter six, Kolbert visits the Netherlands where the Dutch have made many provisions to prevent the increasing problem of widespread flooding. Water-ministry official Eelke Turkstra predicts that the Nieuwe Merwede canal will rise several feet above the local dikes around 2100 due to the flooding. The two main problems are caused by warming water that leads to expansion and raises the sea level, another is due to precipitation changes produced by a warming Earth. \\n\\nTurkstra believes that instead of building more dikes, the existing dikes should be dismantled to make room for the rising water. He wants to buy polder (land that has been laboriously reclaimed from the water) from farmers and lower surrounding dikes around them to create more area for the rising water. Then, Kolbert talks to Dura Vermeer who creates amphibious homes which will float on the water if a flood were to occur.\\n\\nKolbert interviews Robert Socolow, the co-director for the Carbon Mitigation Initiative, about BAU or “business as usual”, which is a future in which current emissions trends continue without being checked. Socolow came up with a plan to help keep carbon emissions down but in order for his plans to work they must start taking effect as soon as possible. Socolow’s plan consisted of a fifteen point system where each point, known as a “stabilization wedge”, would reduce carbon emission by one billion metric tons a year. The wedges consisted of finding alternative fuel sources such as wind, solar and nuclear power, along with developing new technology and upgrading current technology to reduce carbon emission. Socolow argues that the government needs to get involved in order help motivate people to lower carbon emissions. Kolbert also interviews Marty Hoffert, Professor of physics at New York University. Hoffert believes that in order to fight global warming, people have to come up with new ways to generate power without producing carbon. This can be achieved, as he proposes, through satellite solar power (SSP). SSP means collecting solar energy using orbiting satellites which beam the power to ground using microwaves for collection by a rectenna. Energy can be transferred to Earth 24 hours a day without interference from clouds or nightfall. Hoffert also argues that we must change our view on global warming and divert from the BAU or else our civilization will not last.\\n\\nThe Kyoto Protocol, active as of February 16, 2005, is a worldwide effort between nations to control greenhouse gas emissions. It began in 1992 and was supported by the U.S. president George H.W. Bush, who attended the U.N. Framework Convention where the U.S. agreed, along with other Annex 1 countries (China, Canada, Japan and nations of Europe included) , to “return their emissions to 1990 levels,” or below. Clinton, succeeding president to Bush, also supported the protocol, but emission levels kept rising and not much was accomplished during his term. The Bush administration pulled the U.S. out of Kyoto in 2001 (it was one of only two nations to do so), where George W. Bush, who once promised solutions for controlling CO emissions during his campaign, now took a different stand that no longer supported Kyoto because, as he said to the public, the “state of scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to, global climate change”, are “incomplete”.Greenhouse gases are increasing rapidly (20% since 1990) and the US accounts for 34% of Annex 1 emissions. Since 2000, the Bush administration began using a “greenhouse gas intensity system”, which measures the ratio of emissions to economic output as a way of measuring emissions as a whole. Kolbert argues that the system is misleading and favors industrial development because while greenhouse gas levels are actually rising, according to this system they are supposedly falling.According to Kolbert, the improper feed of information to the public is also supplement by books and web groups funded by huge corporations such as Exxon Mobil and General Motors, who are giving out information contradicting proven and alarming scientific evidence about global warming. Articles produced are falsely stating, among many things, that weather can’t be predicted ahead of time, global warming isn’t real and hasn’t been proven, or that a warming climate is something to celebrate.\\n\\nKolbert writes about Burlington, Vermont’s largest city. Years ago, the citizens decided to stand up to global warming by using less power instead of buying more. The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, who has been mayor since 1989, came up with a program that encourages contractors to engage not in demolition but in “deconstruction”. This helps the city save energy by reducing waste and cutting down the need for new materials. Burlington’s electric department (BED) has a wind turbine that provided enough power for thirty homes and gets half of its energy from renewable sources, such as its 50 megawatt power plant that runs off of wood chips. The BED also leases compact fluorescent light bulb for twenty cents a month because a family who uses these bulbs can cut their electricity bill by 10 percent. The city of Burlington estimates that their energy saving projects over the course of this lifetime will prevent the release of 175,000 tons of carbon. Burlington residents also eat locally and have turned old waste sites into an assortment of community gardens and cooperatives, the waste from these gardens is taken to a composting factory, and turned back into soil, making this process a “closed loop”. Clavelle’s plan has begun to pick up across America beginning with Greg Nickles, the mayor of Seattle, who created a set of principles called the “US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement”. This agreement has been signed by over a hundred and seventy mayors, representing about thirty – six million people. This agreement is trying to prove how much can be done at the local level and Clavelle hopes that more cities will adopt this plan. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California later issued an executive order to drastically reduce California's greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nKolbert wraps up the book's main ideas by introducing a few new ideas and themes about climate change that had not been previously mentioned. The chapter starts out saying that modern humans are one of the primary influences on our environment and that we are entering an era aptly named the “Anthropocene” — the age of Homo sapiens. Kolbert also discusses the impacts and discovery of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. Most of what she discusses about CFCs in this chapter is based around the discovery of their negative impact on our ozone layer and the fact that this discovery only came about by accident. Kolbert also writes that we as a species can either come together to survive, or protect our self-interests as Earth’s climate continues to spiral out of our control. As Kolbert points out at the end of the chapter, if nothing changes in the way society looks at climate change, the world will tear itself apart. There is proof of this today, as entire countries evacuate due to severe weather changes, or others fight to control major resources such as food, water, and shelter. As people living in developed countries, we often take these basic needs for granted and do not realize how precious they really are.\\n\\n"}

Dewan wrote that this award cannot equal the prestige of the Gold Glove, which started 50 years earlier, but it provides an alternative.\\n\\nDewan felt that statistics in addition to visual observation and subjective judgment are integral in determining the best defensive players. The Fielding Bible Award attempts to address the deficiencies Dewan saw with the Gold Glove Award, previously the only organized subjective judgment of fielding. The voting for the Fielding Bible Awards are for the entire MLB, and not separated between the National League and the American League; playing defense was not perceived to be any different between the two leagues. The voters select the best defensive player at each position with the best player given 10 points, the second best nine points and so forth. The specific outfield positions are picked individually instead of choosing three generic outfielders. Each voter selects 10 players for each position. The candidates for each position are defined beforehand to eliminate the possibility of a vote going to player who was not really playing the position. (Rafael Palmeiro won the 1999 AL Gold Glove at first base despite being primarily a designated hitter and appearing in only 28 games as a first baseman that season.) The voting at each position is summarized and published, identifying who everybody voted for. This aims to instill accountability among the voters and provide insight of the process to the public.\\n\\nThere have been some major differences between the player selections made for the Fielding Bible Awards and the Gold Glove Awards. The Boston Globe writer Peter Abraham said the Fielding Bible Awards \"are far more accurate (and accountable)\" than the Gold Glove awards since statistics are used along with the opinions of the expert panel. The Gold Gloves are selected by managers and coaches that may have seen a player as few as six times all season. Geoff Baker of The Seattle Times said the votes for the Gold Gloves rely largely on a player's past reputation. Derek Jeter, winner of multiple Gold Gloves, believes that many defensive factors cannot be quantified.\\n\\n"}

It was bought in 1829 by the William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. He had the property, situated at 1, Lewes Crescent, joined internally with an adjacent property he also owned at 14, Chichester Terrace by Thomas Cubitt, using workmen from Chatsworth. The Duke had the property redecorated by John Gregory Crace in 1848, and lived there until his death in 1858.\\n\\nThe Duke of Fife lived in the property from 1896, with his wife, Princess Louise, the daughter of King Edward VII. The house was named Fife House at that time. King Edward visited the house on a number of occasions, most notably staying there during his convalescence in 1908. It was for this reason that the King's toilet was installed in the house. Princess Louise lived in the property until 1924.\\n\\nFrom 1947 and for most of the rest of the 20th century, Fife House was the home of the Weston family, who founded and ran the nearby Nevill House Hotel.\\n\\nDuring renovation work in 2001 the decoration carried out by Crace was rediscovered under several layers of wallpaper.\\n\\nTelecommunications millionnaire Patrick Naughton bought the property in 2002 for £2.85 million. The bathrooms in Fife House were renovated in 2002 by Emily Swift-Jones and Joseph Atkinson of Aurum Design.\\n\\nThe property was sold in 2008, to an unknown buyer, for £1.75 million. It was reported that the property had been occupied by squatters during December 2008, but they had moved out by mid-January 2009.\\n\\n"}

They are known especially for their hunting of langur and macaque monkeys for subsistence. They also gather wild forest tubers, fruits, and greens on a regular basis. They normally do no gardening, farming, or work for others as tenants or wage laborers. To obtain grain, iron, cloth, and jewelry, they trade handmade wooden bowls and boxes to local farmers. They do not sell other forest products, bushmeat, or forest medicinal plants.\\n\\nTheir population is estimated at about 650 persons living in small settlements in the Karnali and Mahakali (Kali) watershed regions of western Nepal. Their language is currently classified as Tibeto-Burman and is closely related to the language spoken by two related ethnic groups, the Ban Raji (\"Little Rulers of the Forest\") and Raji (\"Little Rulers\") of the same region (Fortier and Rastogi 2004). The Raute use this name for their autonym, their own name for themselves, as well as their exonym, the name used by outsiders to refer to them.

{"title": "File:In the Wake of Poseidon.jpg", "body": "Cover of the King Crimson album In the Wake of Poseidon (1970), itself derived from \"The Twelve Archetypes\" by Tammo de Jongh (1967).\\n\\nDeveloped by John da Monte, Richard Gardner, Tammo de Jongh and others, the 12 personality archetypes are based upon the four elements of earth water fire and air, combined into couplets like earth-water, air-fire, etc. The colour pictures for these 12 'face archetypes' were painted by London-based artist Tammo de Jongh in 1967. \\n\\nThe twelve faces are as follows:\\n\\nArchetype-patriarch\\n\\nair-water - the picture shows an old philosopher, with a long face and long white hairand long white beard and moustache; white bushy eyebrows; all around are shapes like flowers or snowflakes; the brow is furrowed upwards from the nose in a fan-like fashion; dominant colours white and yellow.\\n\\nArchetype-logician\\n\\nair-fire - the picture shows a scientist or wizard type man with long face, dark hair and long dark beard; he appears to hold a long stick or wand with his right hand and his left is held aloft and surrounded by stars, which are also seen all around him and a large star can be seen at the end of the wand and also on the palm of his left hand, a cluster of stars twinkle and blaze about his left hand; he wears dark-rimmed spectacles and his large watery dark eyes look away to the left (his right) and not at the observer; his clothes appear in a triangular or harlequin design; his expression is blank with mouth slightly open.\\n\\nArchetype-observer\\n\\nair-earth - the picture shows a scientist type person with round spectacles pushed up above his brow reflecting light; a grey face, mostly bald head with white hair at the sides; his left hand is held up to his chin with thumb and fingers folded together; he looks kind and thoughtful, but absorbed in solving some mathematical or scientific problem; dominant colours white and grey.\\n\\nArchetype-actress\\n\\nwater-fire - the picture shows an Egyptian girl with long pearl earrings and many pearl necklaces around her neck; she is dark, Liz Taylor like with large eyes with dark make-up on the lashes and tear droplets flowing down her face; she has a half-moon facing upwards on her brow and long dark hair but with a fringe just above her eyebrows; she gazes intently with clear peaceful eyes.\\n\\nArchetype-enchantress\\n\\nwater-earth - the picture shows a sad girl with watery eyes gazing at the observer; her long dark hair is blown sideways across her face and brow from right to left; her pale eyes are clear but sultry as if focussed on something faraway; her face is otherwise expressionless.\\n\\nArchetype-child\\n\\nwater-air - the picture shows a picture of innocence; a girl with delicate sweet smile and butterfly shaped bows at each side in her long golden hair; her eyes are large and watery and she has a delicate sweet smile on her mouth; she has a blouse neatly buttoned at the neck with a dark pullover; around her neck she wears a gold chain, on the end of which is a small golden key\\n\\nArchetype-joker\\n\\nfire-air - the picture in bright reds and yellows is of a smiling twinkle-eyed 'court jester' with gold-stuccoed, triangular hat reminiscent of a matador; clothes have a harlequin multicolored design; dominant colours red and gold.\\n\\nArchetype-warrior\\n\\nfire-earth - the picture is of a dark and powerful warrior's face in blacks and reds. He wears a steel helmet and has dark deep-set eyes, broad square face, open mouth with square teeth and a full black beard; his aura is one of stern aggression and forcefulness.\\n\\nArchetype-fool\\n\\nfire-water - the picture shows a close up of a laughing face in reds and yellows; it is fat and gnome-like with a wispy beard around the chin and a star on the end of the small nose; the eyes and mouth smile radiantly with great joy exuding from the face; they appear to be laughing in a very kind and affectionate way; the huge grin dominates the whole face.\\n\\nArchetype-oldwoman\\n\\nearth-air - the picture shows an old woman with much wrinkled face wrapped up against the cold, peasant-like with slit-like eyes and thin mean mouth; she is huddled and holds her clothing tight about her neck; she wears a head-scarf Russian-peasant style and seems absorbed in sad thoughts of the past; dominant colours grey and brown.\\n\\nArchetype-slave\\n\\nearth-fire - the picture shows in close-up a black African with large gold earrings and a ring through his/her nose; the lips are full and pink, the eyes half-closed, sultry and sensuous; the expression is warm and friendly.\\n\\nArchetype-mothernature\\n\\nearth-water - the picture shows a close-up of a dark and full-mouthed girl or boy lying asleep in the long grass of a meadow; their face in silhouette is viewed from the left side and all around are the beautiful flowers and butterflies of the meadow; above arch branches of a tree and a nice sky; there are snails and toadstools among the foreground of grasses and delicate flowers; dominant colour green.\\n\\n"}

In the left frame, an unmanipulated detail of the sky with clouds and the horizon. In the middle frame, I used a magic wand to select the blue sky and created another layer. I filled the selected area with 54-122-226 Blue, used 4.0 Gaussian blur and set the layer to 62% darken. In the right frame, a closeup of the middle section showing the effect of the masking. There are two tell-tale signs: 1. The clearly defined boundaries of the clouds, and 2. the lack of gradation between sky at the top of the image and sky close to the horizon. With pretty much any picture of a blue sky you take, the blue gets lighter closer to the horizon. ~ trialsanderrors 21:13, 26 November 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n"}

The calculation is from the classical diffraction theory, and is given by s = 0.5 - 0.5 * cos(angle), where angle is the phase shift of the edge in radians. The calculation result is given as a percentage. Even for a gradual phase transition, as long as the illumination field extends much wider than the transition region, the result is still a very good estimate.\\n\\nThe unscattered field amplitude (per unit area) is given in the classical diffraction theory by 0.5 + (0.5 exp[i*angle]). The 0.5 factor comes from the division of the scattering surface by the phase edge into one half that acts as a reference (first term), and a second half on the other side of the edge that represents the phase shift (second term in parenthesis). This is a complex number, whose magnitude squared corresponds to the unscattered light intensity. The result of this squaring of the magnitude is 0.5 + 0.5 * cos(angle). To obtain the scattered light intensity we subtract the unscattered intensity from the incident light intensity, which is normalized to unity. This leaves us with the result 0.5 - 0.5 * cos(angle).\\n\\n"}
