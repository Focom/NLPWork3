{"title": "Dr. Phibes Rises Again", "body": "Dr. Phibes Rises Again! (1972) was the second Dr. Phibes movie, a sequel to The Abominable Dr. Phibes. It was directed by Robert Fuest, and starred Vincent Price as Dr. Anton Phibes.\\n\\nThe moon rises at a predestined angle and awakens the sleeping Dr. Phibes in 1928, three years after the events of the previous movie. To his dismay, he finds that his house has been demolished and his papyrus scrolls stolen, the scrolls he needs to find the Pharaoh's Tomb in Egypt, where the River of Life flows. After identifying the source of the papyrus theft, he packs and leaves for Egypt with his assistant Vulnavia - whose face displays no effects from the acid shower she received at the end of the previous film (although the character is now played by a different actress, Valli Kemp). His primary goal is the awakening of his dead wife, Victoria.\\n\\nThe thieves of Phibes' scrolls suffer an attrition problem as Inspectors Trout and Waverly chase Phibes across the world. The party is led by Beiderbeck (Robert Quarry, best known for playing Count Yorga). Although he looks young, he is several hundred years old and wants to find the River of Life in order to stay alive and be with his lover Diana (Fiona Lewis) forever. This time Phibes' murders all have an Egyptian theme to them; for example, one character is sand-blasted to death. Other deaths include someone being stung to death by scorpions, being eaten by an eagle (in the original script impaled by a gold eagle in the same way a doctor in The Abominable Dr. Phibes was impaled by a golden unicorn), and a golden snake piercing someone's skull.\\n\\nAt the climax, Beiderbeck sacrifices his life in order to save Diana. The film ends with Phibes riding a raft down the River of Life with Victoria, while singing \"Over the Rainbow\" (which is strange, as this film is set in 1928 but \"Over The Rainbow\" wasn't written until 1938). It is left ambiguous whether Victoria is resurrected or not, although a picture inside the DVD shows her in the raft with her eyes open and smiling at the camera.\\n\\nThe movie was filmed in London and on location in a desert in Spain in December 1971 through January 1972, and released in July 1972. The original Vulnavia, Virginia North, reportedly was pregnant and was replaced by model Valli Kemp, who had been Miss Australia of 1970.\\n\\nThe film was rushed into production after the success of the first. The script, penned by Fuest, suffered due to budget restraints, as well as studio meddling (it was they who forced Vulnavia to return, Phibes was originally to have a new assistant, as well as many parts and plot points getting edited out, leaving some viewers confused.) Phibes' over-the-top murders in the film seem to be done as much for the demented glee of it than out of revenge, as was the case in the original film. It did not help that Vincent Price and Robert Quarry did not get along well behind the scenes, what with Quarry accusing Price of overacting, and Price viewing his costar as an AIP-sanctioned Eve Harrington. Some other actors from the original film, such as Terry-Thomas, appeared in different roles.\\n\\nDue to copyright difficulties, Price's rendition of \"Over the Rainbow\" was replaced on the original VHS release by background music lifted from the end credits of \"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\" For prints shown in theaters and on television, the original ending is always intact. The original music is restored on the DVD edition. (Several other American International Pictures from this period suffered a similar fate when released for home video, having their original scores replaced. For example: Witchfinder General and Scream and Scream Again.)\\n\\nWhile opinion on this film is divided, it is generally considered as good as the first Phibes outing. Over the years, like the first film, it has developed a strong cult following.\\n\\n1971: The Bride of Dr. Phibes. William Goldstein and James Whiton proposed this to AIP as a sequel to the first film. Set in the year 1934, it details a battle of wits between Phibes and a strange man named Emil Salveus, a member of a secret Satanic society called the Institute for Psychic Phenomena. We learn that Salveus is actually Lem Vesalius, the son of Joseph Cotten's Henri Vesalius who'd earlier appeared in The Abominable Dr. Phibes. Salveus manages to steal Victoria's body, leading Phibes to kill off the various members of the IPP in a quest to recover her.\\n\\nFirst to go is the group's leader, Colonel Trenchard, whom Phibes encases in amber and shatters in a million pieces. This is carried out at the IPP offices, and is also where Phibes gets the names and addresses of the other members. Charles Carruthers is soon sucked dry by leeches in his bathtub. Orchestra conductor Sir Mastin Mateland finds himself covered with melted butter and eaten by a lobster. Lady Peune has a helium balloon tied to her wheelchair and ascends to the heavens. Arch Vicar Wren has his organs sucked out by a vacuum device. Sir Judah Ido Adibo of the Abyssinian Embassy is left with a clutch of cobras in his bed. Salveus himself falls into an acid pit he'd previously prepared for Phibes.\\n\\nUltimately Phibes manages to recover and revive Victoria in a scene recalling The Bride of Frankenstein (1935). As Scotland Yard invades Phibes' manor, the doctor and his bride enter a freezing chamber which will preserve them for a future date. A perplexed Inspector Trout remarks, \"Commissioner, we could search hell and damnation, scour the very bowels of this earth....but he'll never be found. (pause) Perhaps he was never meant to exist\".\\n\\nProducer Louis Heyward rejected The Bride of Dr. Phibes, instead tapping his old friend Robert Blees to script something entirely different. Blees' first idea, which never progressed beyond one-page conjecture, was tentatively titled Phibes II and would've had Phibes pitting wits against Robert Quarry's Count Yorga. Blees ousted this in favor of the Egyptian scenario soon to become Dr. Phibes Rises Again, with Robert Fuest stepping in to do a re-write. The idea of casting Quarry remained, as Phibes' counterpart Darius Biederbeck rather than Yorga.\\n\\n197?: Dr. Phibes in the Holy Land. Mentioned by Vincent Price in a number of interviews. Copies of the screenplay remain elusive.\\n\\n197?: The Son of Dr. Phibes by Robert Fuest. Unknown how far along this got in scripting. Phibes would've been joined by his son (to have been played by a young Vincent Price look-alike) to wage war on environmental polluters. The modus operandi would involve natural-geologic phenomenon: tidal waves, earthquakes and so on.\\n\\n1977: Phibes Resurrectus. This is the same thing as The Bride of Dr. Phibes, with minor alterations. Goldstein and Whiton sold it to Roger Corman's New World Pictures; Corman in turn planned to cast Forrest J Ackerman (the self-described Poor Man's Vincent Price) as a mechanical Phibes doppelganger that fools Inspector Trout during sequence set in a stadium (Wembley in the Bride version, simply \"soccer stadium\" here).\\n\\n1981: Dr. Phibes. Definitely exists in the form of a brief outline/sales pitch by Goldstein and Whiton; it is unknown whether the idea progressed to scripting stages. Phibes is revived in 1981 and sets sail for New York aboard his 98-foot yacht. The city's diseased squalor is contrasted with Phibes' seafaring Art Deco idyll, replete with Clockwork Wizards, Vulnavia and of course the dearly departed Victoria.\\n\\nEnsconced in a resplendent penthouse apartment, Phibes plans to resurrect his bride and build a new life in America. His activities rouse the interest of the Wormwood Institute, an elite \"think tank of glorious eggheads\" led by the 80 year old Hector Seneca Cicero Wormwood. Each of the six Institute members, we learn, leads a \"strange private life\".\\n\\nAstrophysicist Bulwark Stanton, the most devious of the group, is obsessed with little girls and keeps a mechanical effigy of one at home. Lester is threatening to disprove Einstein's theory of general relativity at the tender age of 12; he's champing at the bit to match wits with Phibes. The Smith Brothers, experts in economics and nuclear weaponry, are identical twin transvestites. Wormwood himself wet nurses directly from the tap, laboring under the illusion that such is the key to eternal life.\\n\\nWhen the old man smashes Victoria's glass coffin, she dries out and decomposes. Phibes is enraged and vows revenge. He kills off each of the Institute members according to their greatest love; the germ warfare expert Mr. Nim enjoys chocolate, and is summarily transformed into a chocolate statue, etc. Phibes concurrently conducts an urgent search for the essential salts to restore Victora's vitality.\\n\\n1984: Phibes Resurrectus from Goldstein and Whiton. This one was prepared for Richard Rubenstein and George Romero under the Laurel Productions banner. More or less the same thing as twice before, but with a re-written first act. Instead of opening with Phibes reawakening in his coffin, he is first seen in a hot air balloon (bearing the motto \"NON OMNIS MORIAR\") over \"the white cliffs of Dover\". This he lands in a cemetery, thereupon proceeding into Victoria's tomb.\\n\\nMost interesting of all, however, is the attached list of proposed stars.\\n\\nPHIBES - David Carradine\\n\\nEMIL - Paul Williams\\n\\nSTEUBEN - Orson Welles\\n\\nWREN - Roddy McDowall\\n\\nLADY PEUNE - Coral Browne\\n\\nWOMBER - Donald Pleasence\\n\\nPROBY - John Carradine\\n\\nADIBO - Sam Jaffe \\n\\n198? The Seven Fates of Dr. Phibes. A treatment by Paul Clemens and Ron Magid. It was submitted to Vincent Price who heartily approved and agreed to recreate his role one more time. It begins where Dr. Phibes Rises Again left off, with Phibes and a revived Victoria departing their Egyptian abode on a quest to recover seven ivory statues depicting figures out of Greek mythology. These statues will allow the pair to join with the gods in the heavens. Upon returning to London however, Phibes discovers that his house has been demolished and the statues sold off to various individuals. Phibes elects to murder each of them in a manner befitting the particular mythological character they possess.\\n\\nDekker has a statue of Cyclops; his eye is poked out. Thundershaft has a Cerberus; Phibes presents him with a large Cerberus figure, one head of which shoots string to tie him up, followed by the second head which spouts gasoline and the third which issues fire. Azzared has an Arachne; her room is filled with spiders. Halifax has a Medusa; he is cased in cement, effectively turning him into stone. The murder spree continues, with Trout and Waverley of Scotland Yard again finding themselves dogged at every turn by the deadly doctor.\\n\\nThe final statue, the Minotaur, is owned by Phibes' archenemy Prof. Norquist. He has found the River of Death, Styx, the waters from which, when packed into bullets, have the capability to end Phibes' eternal life. Norquist is eventually killed by Phibes and the statues are joined, opening the heavens to him.\\n\\nVulnavia's true identity is revealed: the goddess Athena. She says, \"Come children of Zeus\" as Phibes and Victoria ascend to the heavens through an opening in the mountain top, playing the organ all the while. Waverley, who with Trout has followed Phibes all the way to his mountain hideaway in Crete, believes it all to be a trick and says, \"Strike me dead if it's not a hoax\"; he is promptly struck by a lightning bolt and turns into a puff of smoke. Over the Rainbow plays while the credits roll.\\n\\nLouis Heyward also tried to interest NBC in a Phibes TV series. It would've recast the doctor as a benevolent crimefighter who uses his makeup and technological wizardry to ensnare criminals. Goldstein wrote the pilot.\\n\\nTagline: Flesh crawls! Blood curdles! Phibes lives!\\n\\nThe film score by John Gale was released on Perseverance Records March 20, 2003.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dragon Ball", "body": " is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. It was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 through 1995; later the 519 individual chapters were published into 42 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha. Dragon Ball was inspired by the Chinese folk novel Journey to the West. It follows the adventures of Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven mystical objects known as the Dragon Balls, which can summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls for their own desires.\\n\\nThe 42 tankōbon have been adapted into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 through 1996. Additionally, Toei has developed seventeen animated feature films and three television specials, as well as a short-lived third anime spin-off titled Dragon Ball GT, which takes place after the events of the manga. In 2009, Toei began broadcasting a revised, faster-paced version of Dragon Ball Z under the name of Dragon Ball Kai, in which most of the original version's footage not featured in the manga is removed. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising such as a collectible trading card game, and a large number of video games.\\n\\nThe manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America by Viz Media, in the United Kingdom by Gollancz Manga, and in Australia and New Zealand by Chuang Yi. The anime series was licensed by Funimation Entertainment for an English language release worldwide, although the series has been dubbed several times by various studios. In China, a live-action film adaptation was produced in 1989. In 2002, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to produce an American-made live-action film, which was released on April 10, 2009.\\n\\nSince its release, Dragon Ball has become one of the most popular manga and anime series of its time in both Japan and North America. The manga's 42 volumes have sold over 152 million copies in Japan and over 200 million copies worldwide. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humor of the story. Several manga artists have noted that the series was the inspiration for their own now popular works, including Naruto and One Piece.\\n\\nThe series begins with a monkey-tailed boy named Goku befriending a teenage girl named Bulma. Together, they go on a quest to find the seven Dragon Balls. Along the way, they meet and befriend a plethora of martial artists. Goku also undergoes rigorous training regimes and educational programs in order to fight in the World Martial Arts Tournament, a competition involving the most powerful fighters in the world. Outside the tournaments, Goku faces diverse villains such as Emperor Pilaf, the Red Ribbon Army, the Namekian Piccolo Daimao and his offspring Piccolo Jr., who eventually becomes Goku's ally and close friend.\\n\\nAs a young man, Goku meets his older brother Raditz, who tells him that they come from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans. The Saiyans had sent Goku to Earth as an infant to conquer the planet for them, but he suffered a severe head injury soon after his arrival and lost all memory of his mission. Goku refuses to help Raditz continue the mission, after which he begins to encounter other enemies from space, most notably the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who becomes his rival due to Vegeta's obsessive desire to surpass Goku in strength, though in the process, he too eventually becomes Goku's ally. He also encounters Frieza, the galactic overlord responsible for the destruction of the Saiyan race, whose actions cause Goku to transform into a legendary Super Saiyan. After an epic battle on the planet Namek, Goku defeats Frieza, avenging the lives of billions across the universe.\\n\\nSome years later, a group of androids from the former Red Ribbon Army appear, seeking revenge against Goku. During this time, an evil life form called Cell emerges and, after absorbing two of the androids to increase his power, holds his own martial arts tournament to decide the fate of the Earth, but is eventually defeated by Goku's first child Son Gohan. Seven years later, Goku is drawn into another battle for the universe against a magical monster named Majin Buu. Joined by Vegeta and Gohan, Goku succeeds in destroying the evil half of Buu and the good half of Buu settles down with them. Ten years later, at another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets the evil Buu's human reincarnation, Uub. At the end of the series, Goku takes Uub away on a journey to train him as the Earth's next defender.\\n\\nAt its core, Dragon Ball maintains the central tenets of the Weekly Shōnen Jump core philosophy of \"friendship, struggle, and victory\". As the series shifts from a \"heart warming\" story into a more action-oriented piece, the protagonists go through an unending cycle of fighting, winning, losing, and improving. They continue this cycle by using miraculous devices to achieve life after death, all the while continuing their on-going battles with dead heroes, who continue to learn lessons as they defeat their challengers. The series also follows the idea that if someone is trying to be \"the best\", they can reach their goals by constantly challenging themselves.\\n\\nWanting to break from the Western influences common in his other series, when Akira Toriyama began work on Dragon Ball he decided to loosely model it on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. He also redeveloped one of his earlier one shot manga series, Dragon Boy, which was initially serialized in Fresh Jump and released in a single tankōbon volume in 1983. This short work combined the comedic style of Toriyama's successful six-year series Dr. Slump with a more action-oriented plot and paid homage to famous martial art actor Jackie Chan. Toriyama notes that his goal for the series was to tell an \"unconventional and contradictory\" story.\\n\\nIn the early concept of the series, Goku and Piccolo were from Earth. With the introduction of Kami, the idea of having fights from other planets was established and Goku and Piccolo were changed to alien species. For the female characters, Toriyama felt it was not fun to draw \"weak females\" so he created women that he felt were not only \"beautiful and sexy\", but also \"strong\". Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Balls most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku.thumbThe fighting techniques were initially unnamed, but the series editor felt it would be better to name them all. Toriyama proceeded to create names for all of the techniques, except for the  which his wife named when Toriyama was indecisive about what it should be called. When creating the fictional world of the series, Toriyama decided to create it from his own imagination to avoid referencing popular culture. However the island where the World Martial Arts Tournament is held is modeled after Bali. When having fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to a place where nobody lived to avoid difficulties in drawing destroyed buildings. In order to advance the story quickly, he also gave most fighters the ability to fly so they could travel to other parts of the world without inconvenience. This was also the reasoning behind Goku learning to use Instant Transmission (thus allowing characters to teleport to any planet in a second).\\n\\nAfter the first chapters were released, readers commented that Goku seemed rather plain, so his appearance was changed. New characters (such as Master Roshi and Krillin) were added and martial arts tournaments were included to give the manga a greater emphasis on fighting. Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while continuing his initial goal of having Goku be the champion and hero. After Cell's death, he intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series protagonist, but then felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.\\n\\nToriyama based the Red Ribbon Army from a video game he had played named Spartan X in which enemies tended to appear very fast. After the second tournament concluded, Toriyama wanted to have a villain who would be a true \"bad guy.\" After creating Piccolo as the new villain, he noted that it was one of the most interesting parts of the stories and that he, and his son, became one of the favorite characters of the series. With Goku established as the strongest fighter on Earth, Toriyama decided to increase the number of villains that came from outer space. Finding the escalating enemies to be a pain to work with feeling it was too simple, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. During this period of the series, Toriyama placed less emphasis on the series art work, simplifying the lines and sometimes making things \"too square.\" He found himself having problems determining the colors for characters and sometimes ended up changing them unintentionally mid-story. In later accounts, Toriyama noted that he didn't plan out the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series.\\n\\nWritten and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball was initially serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump starting in December 1984. The series ended in 1995 when Toriyama grew exhausted and felt he needed a break from drawing. The 519 individual chapters were published into 42 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha from November 10, 1985 through August 4, 1995. In 2004, the chapters were re-released in a collection of 34 kanzenban volumes, which included a slightly rewritten ending, new covers, and color artwork from its Weekly Shōnen Jump run. Toriyama also created a short series, Neko Majin, that became a self-parody of Dragon Ball. First appearing in Weekly Shōnen Jump in August 1999, the eight chapter series was released sporadically until it was completed in 2005. These chapters were compiled into a \"kanzenban\"-style package for release in Japan on April 4, 2005.\\n\\nThe Dragon Ball manga was licensed for release in English in North America by Viz Media which has released all 42 volumes in both censored and uncensored forms. Viz released volumes 17 through 42 under the title Dragon Ball Z to mimic the name of the anime series adaptated from those volumes, feeling it would reduce the potential for confusion by its readers. The first volumes of both series were released in March 2003, with Dragon Ball being completed on August 3, 2004 and Dragon Ball Z finishing on June 6, 2006. In June 2008, Viz began re-releasing the two series in a wideban format called \"VIZBIG Edition,\" which collects three individual volumes into a single large volume.\\n\\nIn 2006, Toriyama and One Piece author Eiichiro Oda teamed up to create a single chapter crossover of their individual hit series. Entitled Cross Epoch, the chapter was published in the December 25, 2006 issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump. \\n\\nA manga adaptation of Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!! illustrated by Ooishi Naho, was published in the March 21, 2009 and April 21, 2009 issues of V Jump. Ooishi Naho will also write a spin-off series titled Dragon Ball SD, which is going to be published by Shueisha's Super Strong Jump magazine.\\n\\nDue to the high popularity of the Dragon Ball manga, Toei Animation produced two anime television series based on the manga chapters, and a third based on the series characters. The first series, also titled Dragon Ball, premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on February 26, 1986 and ran until April 12, 1989, lasting 153 episodes.\\n\\nHarmony Gold USA licensed the series for an English-language release in North America in the late 1980s. In their voice dub of the series, Harmony renamed almost all of the characters, with some names appearing very odd, such as Goku being renamed \"Zero\" and the character Korin's name changed to \"Whiskers the Wonder Cat.\" This dub version was test-marketed in several cities, but was cancelled before it could be broadcast to the general public.\\n\\nIn 1995, Funimation Entertainment acquired the license for the distribution of Dragon Ball in North America, as well as its sequel series Dragon Ball Z. Funimation contracted BLT Productions to create an English voice track for the first anime at their Canadian-based dubbing studio and the dubbed episodes were edited for content. Thirteen episodes aired in first-run syndication during the fall of 1995 before Funimation canceled the project due to low ratings, switching to working immediately on the more action-oriented Dragon Ball Z. Trimark Pictures later purchased the home video distribution rights for these dubbed episodes. In March 2001, Funimation announced the return of Dragon Ball to American television, featuring a new English audio track produced at their own Texas-based dubbing studio, as well as slightly less editing, though they notably left the original background music intact, unlike their dubs of the two sequel series. The redubbed episodes were broadcast on Cartoon Network from August 20, 2001 to December 1, 2003. Funimation also broadcast the series on Colours TV and their own Funimation Channel starting in 2006.\\n\\nFunimation began releasing their in-house dub to Region 1 DVD box sets on March 18, 2003. Each box set, spanning an entire saga of the series, included the English dub track and the original Japanese audio track with optional English subtitles. However, they were unable to release the first thirteen episodes at the time, due to Lionsgate Entertainment holding the distribution rights to their original dub of the same episodes, having acquired them from Trimark after the company became defunct. After Lionsgate's license to the first thirteen episodes expired in 2009, Funimation remastered and re-released the complete Dragon Ball series to DVD in five individual season box sets, with the first set released on September 15, 2009 and the final set on July 27, 2010.\\n\\nIn the Philippines, a now-defunct anime series dubbed in English audio, shown on GMA-7 from 1987 to 1990 and returned to the said channel from 1998 to 1999, when it diverted to Filipino audio since channel 7 began on its foreign satellite broadcasts between 1974 and 1986, to bring anime from Japan. It began last November 29, this was aired on Q by replacing Monster Buster Club. Later diverted on RPN-9 during primetime from 1996 to 1997.\\n\\nWith the ending of Dragon Ball, Toei Animation quickly released a second anime television series, . Picking up where the first left off, Dragon Ball Z is adapted from the final twenty-six volumes of the manga series. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.\\n\\nFollowing the short-lived dub of Dragon Ball in 1995, Funimation Entertainment began production on an English-language release of Dragon Ball Z in North America. They contracted Saban Entertainment to help finance and distribute the series to television, and sub-licensed home video distribution to Geneon Universal Entertainment. Saban hired Ocean Productions to dub the anime into English and contracted Shuki Levy to compose an alternate musical score. This dub of Dragon Ball Z was heavily edited for content, as well as length, reducing the first 67 episodes into 53. The series premiered in the United States on September 13, 1996 in first-run syndication, but also struggled to find a substantial audience during its run, and was eventually cancelled after two seasons. Funimation dissolved its partnership with Saban and Geneon soon after. On August 31, 1998, however, the same 53 dubbed episodes began airing on Cartoon Network as part of the channel's action-oriented programming block, Toonami, where the series received much more popularity. With new success, Funimation continued production on the series by themselves, with less editing due to fewer restrictions on cable programing. However, they could no longer afford the services of either the Ocean voice cast or Shuki Levy's music without Saban's financial assistance, resulting in the creation of their own in-house voice cast and a new musical score composed by Bruce Faulconer. Dragon Ball Z was now in full production in the United States and the new dub of the series aired on Toonami from September 13, 1999 to April 7, 2003.\\n\\nThe Funimation dubbed episodes also aired in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand. Beginning with episode 108, however, an alternate dub, produced by Westwood Media (in association with Ocean Productions), was broadcast in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Ireland (as well as Canada beginning with episode 168), while Funimation's in-house dub continued to air in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2004, Geneon lost its distribution rights to the first 53 dubbed episodes of Dragon Ball Z, allowing Funimation to re-dub them with their in-house voice cast and restore them to the original 67 count. These re-dubbed episodes aired on Cartoon Network during the summer of 2005. In 2006, Funimation remastered the episodes in 16:9 widescreen format, and began re-releasing the series to DVD in nine individual season box sets. The first set was released on February 6, 2007; the final set on May 19, 2009. These sets were notable for including the option of hearing Funimation's in-house dub alongside the original Japanese music, an option that had previously not been available. Other options included hearing the in-house dub with the American soundtrack composed by Bruce Faulconer, and a third option included watching the original Japanese version, with the original Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles.\\n\\nIn July 2009, Funimation announced that they would be re-releasing Dragon Ball Z in a new seven-volume DVD set called the \"Dragon Boxes,\" which were previously released in Japan as a five-volume set containing the entire anime franchise. Based on the original series masters with frame-by-frame restoration, the first set was released on November 10, 2009. Unlike the season box sets, Funimation's \"Dragon Box\" release is presented in fullscreen 4:3 format. Funimation and Toei Animation released a statement in January 2011 confirming that they would stream Dragon Ball Z within 30 minutes before their simulcast of One Piece. The simulcast premiered on January 15, 2011.\\n\\nIt was also seen on RPN-9 from 1994 to 1995 and from 1997 to 1998 during Sundays. Later moved to GMA-7 from 2000 to 2001 and it returned onwards as the longest running anime.\\n\\nProduced by Toei Animation,  premiered on Fuji TV on February 2, 1996, and ran until November 19, 1997. Unlike the first two series, it was not based on the original Dragon Ball manga. The series lasted 64 episodes. In Dragon Ball GT, Goku is turned back into a child by the Black Star Dragon Balls and is forced to travel across the galaxy to retrieve them.\\n\\nFollowing the success of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z in the U.S., Funimation Entertainment licensed Dragon Ball GT for an English language Region 1 DVD release and television broadcast. Funimation's dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network from November 14, 2003 to January 29, 2005. The television broadcast skipped the first 16 episodes of the series. Instead, Funimation created a composition episode entitled \"A Grand Problem,\" which used scenes from the skipped episodes to summarize the story. The skipped episodes, advertised as \"The Lost Episodes,\" were later aired after the remaining episodes of the series had been broadcast.\\n\\nFunimation released their dub to bilingual Region 1 DVD in two season box sets, with the first set released on December 9, 2008 goku the power super effect from qi and the final set on February 10, 2009, which also featured the Dragon Ball GT TV special, A Hero's Legacy. In a similar fashion to their DVD releases for Dragon Ball Z, the DVD box sets have the option of hearing the English dub alongside the original Japanese music, and the rap song used for the TV airing of the show (nicknamed by fans \"Step Into the Grand Tour\") has been replaced by English-dubbed versions of the original Japanese opening and ending songs. Funimation later released a \"Complete Series\" box set of Dragon Ball GT (using the same discs as the two season sets, but with different packaging) on September 21, 2010.\\n\\nIn February 2009, Toei Animation announced that it would begin broadcasting a revised version of Dragon Ball Z as part of the series' 20th anniversary celebrations. The series premiered on April 5, 2009, under the name , with the episodes remastered for HDTV, featuring updated opening and ending sequences, and a rerecording of the vocal tracks by most of the original cast. The footage was also re-edited to more closely follow the manga, resulting in a faster moving story, and damaged frames removed. As such, it is a new version created from the original Dragon Ball Z footage.\\n\\nLike all other Dragon Ball-based anime, Funimation Entertainment licensed Dragon Ball Kai for an English-language release in North America, featuring most of the voice cast from their in-house dub of the original version, as well as several changes. The series made its U.S. premiere on Nicktoons on May 24, 2010, under the title Dragon Ball Z Kai. In addition to Nicktoons, the series also began airing on The CW's Saturday-morning programming block, Toonzai, on August 14, 2010. Both the Nicktoons and Toonzai airings are edited for content, though the Toonzai version is edited even more so than Nicktoons', most notably recoloring the character Mr. Popo (attacked for being similar to a blackface stereotype) blue and replacing dead characters' halos with glowing orbs. However, in addition to the TV airings, Funimation is also releasing bilingual, uncut DVD and Blu-Ray box sets of the show. These box sets contain the original Japanese audio track with English subtitles, as well as the unedited version of the English dub of the DVD, which re-inserts the objectionable scenes and dialogue deemed inappropriate for the TV airings, and does not contain any of the digital edits made for the TV airings.\\n\\nAs of 2010, Kirby Morrow announced that Ocean Productions had started producing an alternate dub for Dragon Ball Z Kai. Although he didn't reveal too much, he stated that the company who is responsible for the project had told him after his audition that his voice sounded \"too cool\" for Goku, strongly implying that they will not re-cast him as Goku for the Ocean dub of Kai. Production work hasn't started since it's still unknown.\\n\\nSeventeen anime films based on the Dragon Ball series have been released in Japan. The first three films were based on the original Dragon Ball anime series. The remaining films included thirteen Dragon Ball Z films and one tenth anniversary special (also based on the first anime series). Funimation Entertainment has licensed and released all of the films to home video in North America.\\n\\nThree television specials based on the series were released in Japan. The first, Bardock – The Father of Goku, was released on October 17, 1990. It is a prequel to the series, set years before the start of the manga and details how Goku's father, Bardock, discovers that Frieza is planning to kill all the other Saiyans, and his efforts to stop him. The second special, The History of Trunks was released on March 24, 1993. Based on an extra chapter of the original manga, it is set in a parallel universe where most of the series characters are killed by the evil androids. A Hero's Legacy, released on March 26, 1997, is set 100 years after the end of Dragon Ball GT. It features one of Goku's descendants who begins looking for the Dragon Balls in order to help his sick grandmother, Pan.\\n\\nTwo other specials were also released in Japan. A two-episode original video animation (OVA) series titled Dragon Ball Z Gaiden: Saiyan Zetsumetsu Keikaku, based on the Famicom video game of the same name, was released in 1993 and was set during Dragon Ball Z. Another special, Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!, premiered at the Jump Super Anime Tour on November 24, 2008. The special is set two years after the defeat of the evil Buu and has Goku and his friends facing against new enemies, Abo and Kado, and meeting Vegeta's younger brother, Tarble and his wife, Gure.\\n\\nThe Dragon Ball franchise has spawned multiple video games across various genres and platforms. Earlier games of the series included a system of card battling and were released for the Nintendo Entertainment System following the storyline of the series. Starting Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation most of the games were from the fighting genre including the series Super Butoden. The first Dragon Ball game to be released in the United States was Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout for the PlayStation on July 31, 1997. For the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games the characters were redone in 3D cel-shaded graphics. These games included the ''Dragon Ball Z: Budokai'' series and the ''Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi'' series. Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit was the first game of the series developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game called Dragon Ball Online is currently in development for release in 2010. It has been stated that Akira Toriyama has been working on character designs for this project for the last five years.\\n\\nMyriad soundtracks were released to the anime, movies and the games. The music for the first two anime Dragon Ball and Z and its films was directed by Shunsuke Kikuchi, while the music from GT was directed by Akihito Tokunaga and the music from Kai was directed by Kenji Yamamoto. For the first anime, the soundtracks released were Dragon Ball: Music Collection in 1985 and Dragon Ball: Complete Song Collection in 1991 although they were reissued in 2007 and 2003, respectively.

Other CDs released are compilations, video games and films soundtracks as well as music from the English versions.\\n\\nA live-action Mandarin Chinese film adaptation of the series, Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins, was released in Taiwan Province in Republic of China in 1989. Considered a \"tacky\" version of the story by critics, the plot revolves around a rag-tag group of heroes, led by \"Monkey Boy\" (Goku) trying to stop King Horn from using the wish-granting \"Dragon Pearls\" (Dragon Balls) to rule the world.\\n\\nIn March 2002, 20th Century Fox acquired feature film rights to the Dragon Ball franchise and began production on an American live action film entitled Dragonball Evolution. Ben Ramsey was tapped to create a screenplay based on Dragon Ball Z. Directed by James Wong and produced by Stephen Chow, the film was released in the United States on April 10, 2009. The film was largely considered a failure by both critics and Dragon Ball fans, and it only grossed $57 million at the box office.\\n\\nthumbThere are two companion books to the series, one called Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files, released in May 1997 and December 1997 by Shueisha's Jump Comics Selection imprint. It include series information, illustration galleries, behind-the-scenes information, and more. They were out of print for many years, but were re-released in April 2006 and this edition is still in print.\\n\\nThe other was Dragon Ball - The Complete Illustrations, first published in Japan in 1995, which was then translated and printed in 2008 by VIZ Media for the English-speaking fans. It contains all the 264 coloured illustrations Akira Toriyama done for the Weekly Jump magazines' covers, bonus giveaways and specials, and all the covers for the 42 tankōbon.

They feature various scenes from the manga and anime stills, plus exclusive artwork from all 3 series.They were previously released in other countries, like Taiwan and Singapore, before making its debut in the United States in July 2008.\\n\\nDragon Ball is one of the most popular manga series of its time, and it continues to enjoy high readership today. By 2000, more than 126 million copies of its tankōbon volumes had been sold in Japan alone. By 2007, this number had grown to pass 150 million in Japan and 300 million worldwide. It is the \"quintessential mainstream manga\" driven by an unending story. Its immense popularity resulted in the series being continuously extended, first through the use of acrobatic devices that regularly kept the series from falling into the routine characters and story lines, then by having the central characters surpass death itself using miraculous devices. In Little Boy: The Art of Japan's Exploding Subculture Takashi Murakami notes that Dragon Ball's \"never-ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly, seamlessly, and with great finesse.\" Goku's journey and his ever growing strength resulted in the character winning \"the admiration of young boys everywhere\". On several occasions the Dragon Ball anime series has topped Japan's DVD sales.\\n\\nIn a survey conducted by Oricon in 2007 between 1,000 people, Goku, the main character of the franchise, ranked first place as the \"Strongest Manga character of all time.\" Manga artists, such as Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto and One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda, have stated that Goku inspired their series' main protagonists as well series structure. When TV Asahi conducted an online poll for the top one hundred anime, the Dragon Ball series came in place twelve. The first episode of Dragon Ball Kai earned a viewer ratings percentage of 11.3, ahead of One Piece and behind Crayon Shin-Chan. Although following episodes have had lower ratings, Dragon Ball Kai remains to be among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan currently.\\n\\nAnimerica felt the series had \"worldwide appeal\" that uses dramatic pacing and over the top martial arts action to \"maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans\". Ridwan Khan from Animefringe.com commented on the manga to have a \"chubby\" art style but as the series continued it gets more refined with the characters leaner and more muscular. He also noted he preferred the manga versions of the series to their animated counterparts that makes the story slower and pointless. Anime News Network praised the story and humor of the manga to be very good due conveying of all the characters's personalities. They also remarked Viz's translation to be one of the best ones of all the English editions of the series praising the lack of censor. Rationalmagic.com remarked the first manga volume as \"a superior humor title\". They praised Goku's innocence and Bulma's insistence as one of the funniest parts of the series. Writer Jason Thompson commented that the series popularity comes from a formula that Toriyama used in various story arcs from which he describes as \"lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, a few jokes.\" Yet, he noted that such formula became the model for other manga from the same genre such as Naruto.\\n\\nThe anime adaptations have also had different positive reviews. Dragon Ball Z was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN's Top 100 Animated Series. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered the series characters are different from stereotypes characters and noted that they have much more development and in its sequels. However, they criticized Dragon Ball Z for having long and repetitive fights, though they remarked the show has good characterization. The storylines of Dragon Ball Z have been compared to Greek mythology. Anime News Network considered Trunks's storyline to have an actual storyline with characters having more motivation than the common plot of the series. IGN commented that Dragon Ball GT \"is downright repellent\" mentioning that the material and characters have lost their novelty and fun. They also criticized the character designs of Trunks and Vegeta as goofy. Anime News Network has had negative comments of Dragon Ball GT. They mentioned the fights from the series are a very simple childish exercise and that many other anime were so much better. The plot of the series has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used on its predecessors.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu", "body": " is an action RPG developed by Nihon Falcom in 1985 for the PC-8801, PC-9801, FM-7, MSX and X1 computers. Enhanced remakes were released for the Sega Saturn, PC-9801 and Windows systems. It is the second in the ''Dragon Slayer'' series, preceded by Dragon Slayer and followed by Romancia, though, as most games in the Dragon Slayer series, have no relation to each other outside of a few gameplay concepts.\\n\\nXanadu is notable for several reasons, including its unbroken sales record for computer games in Japan with over 400,000 copies sold. It was also one of the foundations of the RPG genre, particularly the action RPG subgenre, featuring real-time action combat combined with full-fledged character statistics, innovative gameplay systems such as Karma and individual experience for equipped items, and platform game elements combined with the dungeon crawl gameplay of its predecessor.\\n\\nThe game begins with the player directly in control of the protagonist, with little to no introduction. To progress, one must speak with the king, who gives the player the bare essentials and a small amount of cash to train. After selecting which attributes to raise, the player must find his way out of the city and into the vast underground complex. Finding this exit is the first of many cryptic puzzles the player will encounter, though the game is not a puzzle game but an RPG with puzzle and adventure elements far ahead of its time.\\n\\nXanadu features a unique gameplay system for its time; one which has aged well and continues to be unique in the face of newer ideas. Though it is a very difficult game, it provides many systems that can be used to the protagonist's advantage if used wisely.\\n\\nXanadu has a large set of followups, despite it being technically a sequel itself to Dragon Slayer.\\n\\nA Xanadu OVA was released in 1987 in conjunction with the MSX version of the game and a manga, titled Xanadu: The Legend of Dragon Slayer. The plot was expanded and altered, with the main character now having a name, Fieg (フィーグ), and several new cast members. The new plot elements included several science fiction themes. For example, Fieg is a 21st century soldier from the near future who is dropped into Xanadu after a bloody surprise ambush in the beginning of the story.\\n\\nA soundtrack to the movie was released on record, cassette, and compact disc shortly thereafter.\\n\\nThe manga follows the plot of the movie, and was drawn by Tsuzuki Kazuhiko (都築和彦), who also did work on Falcom's Ys and Sorcerian titles.\\n\\nIn its original PC-8801 release, Xanadu features a small but effective selection of music, most notably the hypnotic \"La Valse Pour Xanadu\", a 3/4 time waltz with a distinctive, haunting melody. A sped-up version is used for the battle scenes. The inside areas of buildings as well as boss encounters have separate songs as well.\\n\\nTo promote the release of the game, Japanese heavy metal band Anthem released an LP with two image songs, appropriately titled \"XANADU\".\\n\\nXanadu Scenario II, an expansion/sequel, featured a much larger set of songs, and as a whole matches the overall high quality of Falcom's songwriting abilities during the later 1980s. Revival Xanadu and Revival Xanadu II, two loose remakes made by Falcom in the 1990s, feature their own unique soundtracks as well. They were composed by Takahito Abe and Yuzo Koshiro. \\n\\nAside from Xanadu Next, no Xanadu titles have received a full, independent original soundtrack on compact disc, an odd move for Falcom. This is likely due to its release being very early in Falcom's life, before they had established a reputation. However, a soundtrack was released for both Xanadu and Xanadu Scenario II on a 12\" Vinyl Record Album, titled, Xanadu Anthem. Selections from Xanadu</nowiki>'<nowiki>s music can be heard in various Falcom albums, and in 1987 \"All Over Xanadu\" was released, featuring arranged versions of Xanadu and Scenario IIs soundtrack being played by a rock band combined with a live orchestra and synthesizers. The main theme of the Xanadu franchise, La Valse Pour Xanadu has been featured in the PC-88 and PC-98 versions of Xanadu and remixed into several audio tracks in Xanadu Next.\\n\\nXanadu was a pioneer in the game industry, and received critical praise from Japanese gaming magazines and a large fan base. To date, according to Falcom, its record of over 400,000 copies sold in Japan has yet to be broken by any personal computer game released in that country.\\n\\nThe influence of Xanadu has been felt in many games developed by Falcom and even other development houses which have copied the look and feel. Ys featured a samely but quicker \"bump\" system for combat used in Ys I, II, and IV; and Romancia, Dragon Slayer IV and Sorcerian all had similar sidescrolling viewpoints. Several smaller companies copied the \"bump\" system, mostly in obscure PC-8801 titles.\\n\\nAlongside its predecessor, Xanadu laid the foundations for the action role-playing game genre, influencing future series like Hydlide, Ys, and The Legend of Zelda. Xanadu was one of the earliest real-time action RPGs with full-fledged character statistics, and it introduced several innovative gameplay mechanics, such as the Karma morality system and individual experience for equipped items. It was also one of the earliest RPGs to feature a platformer-style side-scrolling view, from which it switches to the overhead view of its predecessor during battle.\\n\\nXanadu is the only title Falcom has given a complete commemorative re-release in its original 1980's packaging, and is considered one of Falcom's milestones, if not their defining title, to a generation of fans. Though they had various degrees of success with older titles, Xanadu was Falcom's breakthrough that brought them into the spotlight.\\n\\nXanadu features a number of references to historical locations and legend. The title \"Xanadu\" is a direct reference to the ancient city Xanadu and its mythological reputation. The protagonist will visit Shangri-la during the course of Scenario II, among other locales. Many monsters are based on legendary and factual figures such as spriggan, samurai, hydra, and countless others.\\n\\nOriginally, Xanadu contained plagarized artwork from the manuals of the Origin Systems role-playing game Ultima III: Exodus. This was not discovered by Origin and series creator Richard Garriott until they flew into Tokyo to have a meeting with Nihon Falcom about having Origin release Xanadu in the US, as well as having Falcom help with releasing a port of Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar in Japan. During the presentation of the game, several digitized pictures from the manual of Ultima III appeared in various shops in the game. Upon seeing this, Garriott and Origin ended the meeting and sued Falcom, which was settled out of court and the artwork in the game was changed to what appears now.\\n\\n"}

Among the agents are Officer Wang Sun-Ho, an ex-SWAT officer trained in the United States, two HKPD officers Hung Kei Lok and Pak Yat Suet, ex-PLA sniper Luo Zai-Jun, and ex-SAS operator James \"Jie\" Lam.

The real convoy transporting Tiger is ambushed and the operatives eliminate 7 officers on the scene. The INTERPOL agents arrive but fail to prevent their escape, causing Jie to lose his temper.\\n\\nBack at the HQ, Commander Hon Sun reprimands the agents for disobeying orders but lets them off the hook. Lok visits his sick brother while off duty, Ho decides to do some of his own investigations and Jun, Jie and Suet are later introduced to Kong Long a retired police officer.

Ho tries to hide his identity by pretending to be a visitor from out of town. Petros then retreats to a fortune teller temple where Ho attempts to take Petros down but Petros escapes using his training.\\n\\nPetros then finds Yu Ching being bullied and pretends to befriend her, Even letting himself get beaten up by 3 Chinese gangsters who finish their beating by throwing a dumpster on Petros.Yu Ching however is too trusting and even lets Petros into her house.\\n\\nMeanwhile its revealed Ko has a rivalry with Kong which earned him his scar. Ko tries to kill Kong in a locker room with a machete to machete fight but Ko is forced to retreat after the team is alerted to the danger.\\n\\nLater Petros, Joe, Lee Chun Pei and Ko meet Panther for a deal for the microfilm, they even threaten him showing Tiger's ear cut of earlier. This only results in a gunfight with the operatives eliminating most of Panther's Triads. Ho and Lok arrive on the scene attempting to fight Ko but Ko just defeats them and leaves saying \"I don't have time for this\" and the HKPD arresting Panther. He later gets released on lack of evidence\\n\\nThe Team then seeks advice from Kong on how to catch the operatives. Kong reluctly agrees to train them hard.\\n\\nEventually Hon Sun, prepares a sniper unit, and 3 teams of HKPD officers to ambush the operatives. Petros splits up with Ko after lying to Yu Ching he has to do something. Yuet easily eliminates the snipers, Petros takes out 2 of the HKPD teams and Ko eliminates the HKPD command squad. Hon Sun tries to fight back but is shot without mercy by Petros and is badly wounded.\\n\\nHaving enough of the operatives rampage, Ho, Lok, Jun, Suet and Jie attempt to ambush all the operatives at once. Yuet then engages in firefight with Jun, Petros, Lee Chun Pei and Ko enter a firefight as well against Suet, Jie, Ho and Lok. The operatives change tactics making it harder for the team to kill them. Joe Pearson breaks into a jeep in to evac Petros and Ko. Lee Chun Pei is killed by Suet with one shot from an MP5. Unfortunately Jun who was covering Suet gets distracted and Yuet kills Suet. Thus both sides lose one member of their team\\n\\nBack at HQ, Hon Sun dies of his injuries and Suet is remembered by her comrades and even her target (Cameo by Andy On) After condolences for Suet. The team decides to catch the operatives using all the training. A China agency attempts to deport them but they are saved by Kong who only recently discovers the operatives true intentions. Their plan is then mobilzed.\\n\\nHo gets to Yu Ching first luring her away from the operatives tricking her in believing he is a friend of Petros. Jun shoots Ching's car tire so Petros would pick her up. Ho then leads the operatives to an abandoned warehouse where Jun ambushes Yuet. Joe then enters the inside and is rammed by forklift by Jie. However Jie underestimates and after a few struggles Jie manages to impale Joe onto a large sign nail and electrocute him to death with a shock wire. Jun enters an intense sniper battle and eventually shoots Yuet dead. Kong finally defeats Ko, and with Ko committing suicide by stabbing himself.\\n\\nPetros is the only operative left. Lok posing as a taxi driver drives Ho and Yu Ching away to a mall where Yu Ching is to deliver the microfilm to Panther Duen. Lok tries to keep Petros off Ho's back but Lok is stabbed with a screw and is seemingly killed. Ho is then pistol whipped by Petros and meets back with Yu Ching. Petros decides to deliver the microfilm to Panther. In the cinema. From there Panther takes Petros hostage with a silenced pistol and kill him, but Petros disarms Panther and kills him.\\n\\nPetros then attempts to leave with Yu Ching, only to find Ho who has regained conscious waiting to ambush him. Petros attempts to shoot Ho from a high deck, only to be shot 2 times in the back by Lok who survived the screw stab. Still wounded Lok tells Ho to go after Petros. Ho and Petros then engage in a gunfight where both men shoot each other in the same laundry room at the beginning until their guns are empty. Ho is heavy wounded but manages to shoot Petros to death and discovers the microfilm was in Ching's toy doll all along.\\n\\nBefore the credits roll, Lok, Ho, Kong, Jie and Jun who have all apparently healed arrive at the same bar and fire all their pistols at the same time at the screen\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dravida Nadu", "body": "Dravida Nadu (Tamil: திராவிட நாடு), also known as Dravidistan or Dravidasthan, was the name of a proposed sovereign state for all non-Brahmin speakers of Dravidian languages in South Asia. Initially, the demand of Dravida Nadu proponents was limited to Tamil-speaking region, but later, it was expanded to include other Indian states with Dravidian speakers in majority (Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka.) Some of the proponents also included parts of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Orissa and Maharashtra. Other names for the proposed sovereign state included \"South India\", \"Deccan Federation\" and \"Dakshinapath\".\\n\\nThe movement for Dravida Nadu was at its height from 1940s to 1960s, but failed to find any support outside Tamil Nadu. Even in Tamil Nadu, where the anti-Hindi agitations attracted many supporters, there was no serious demand on the part of the common people for a sovereign Dravidian state.\\n\\nThe reorganization of the Indian states along linguistic lines through the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 weakened the separatist movement., and the prominent Tamil leader E. V. Ramaswamy gave up the demand for Dravida Nadu in 1956. The movement was continued by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which formally gave up its demand for a separate sovereign state in 1963.\\n\\nthumbThe concept of Dravida Nadu had its root in the anti-Brahmin movement in Tamil Nadu, whose aim was to end the alleged Brahmin dominance in the Tamil society and government. The early demands of this movement were social equality, and greater power and control. However, over the time, it came to include a separatist movement, demanding a sovereign state for the Tamil people. The major political party backing this movement was the Justice Party, which came to power in the Madras Presidency in 1921.\\n\\nSince the late 19th century, the anti-Brahmin Tamil leaders had stated that the non-Brahmin Tamils were the original inhabitants of the Tamil-speaking region. The Brahmins, on the other hand, were described not only as oppressors, but even as a foreign power, on par with the British colonial rulers.\\n\\nThe prominent Tamil leader, E. V. Ramasami (popularly known as \"Periyar\") stated that the Tamil society was free of any societal divisions before the arrival of Brahmins, whom he described as Aryan invaders. Periyar was an atheist, and considered the Indian nationalism as \"an atavistic desire to endow the Hindu past on a more durable and contemporary basis\".\\n\\nThe proponents of Dravida Nadu constructed elaborate historical anthropologies to support their theory that the Dravidian-speaking areas once had a great non-Brahmin polity and civilization, which had been destroyed by the Aryan conquest and Brahmin hegemony. This led to an idealization of the ancient Tamil society before its contact with the \"Aryan race\", and led to a surge in the Tamil nationalism. Periyar expounded the Hindu epic Ramayana as a disguised historical account of how the Aryans subjugated the Tamils ruled by Ravana. Some of the separatists also posed Saivism as an indigenous, even non-Hindu religion.\\n\\nThe Indian National Congress, a majority of whose leaders were Brahmins, came to be identified as Brahmin party. Periyar, who had joined Congress in 1919, became disillusioned with what he considered as the Brahminic leadership of the party. The link between Brahmins and Congress became a target of the growing Tamil nationalism.\\n\\nIn 1925, Periyar launched the Self-respect movement, and by 1930, he was formulating the most radical \"anti-Aryanism\". The rapport between the Justice Party and the Self-Respect movement of Periyar (who joined the party in 1935) strengthen the anti-Brahmin and anti-North sentiment. In 1937-38, Hindi and Hindustani were introduced as new subjects in the schools, when C. Rajagopalachari of Congress became the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency. This led to widespread protests in the Tamil-speaking region, which had a strong independent linguistic identity. Periyar saw the Congress imposition of Hindi in government schools as further proof of an Aryan conspiracy.\\n\\nAt the 14th Confederation of the Justice Party held in Madras in 1938, rules and regulations, or precursors of a Dravida Nadu were adopted. The objectives were defined as: to attain Purna Swaraj and complete control for Dravida Nadu in social, economic and industrial, and commercial fields; to liberate Dravida Nadu and Dravidians from exploitation and domination by non-Dravidian foreigners; to acquire for the citizens of Dravida Nadu without discrimination on account of caste and class and inequalities arising there from, in law and society, equal rights and equal opportunities; to remove from the Dravidian people the sense of difference and superstitious beliefs existing in the name of religion, customs, and traditions and unite them as a society of people with a liberal outlook and intellectual development, and to get proportionate representation in all fields till the achievement of these objectives and until the people who have a sense of caste, religious and class differences cooperate with the party in full confidence and goodwill. Thus, Periyar also stated that \"Self Respect should come before self-rule\".\\n\\nThe characteristics of the separate Dravida Nadu was described by Periyar as: the area then comprising Madras Presidency; system of passport to enter the state; duty on goods from other provinces and entry with permit; demarcation of boundaries according to the needs and convenience of Dravida Nadu; and continuing an existing system of defense till grant of full independence. He also assured religious freedom to Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and others within this area. On the same accord, the separation of religion and politics was a part of this leaving religion as a matter of individual belief. It was made clear that the political movement should not be used for religious propaganda.\\n\\nIn December 1938, the Justice Party Convention passed a resolution stressing Tamil people's right to a separate sovereign state, under the direct control of the Secretary of State for India in London.\\n\\nIn 1939, Periyar organized the Dravida Nadu Conference for the advocacy of a separate, sovereign and federal republic of Dravida Nadu. In a speech on December 17, 1939, he raised the slogan \"Dravida Nadu for Dravidians\", which replaced the earlier slogan \"Tamil Nadu for Tamils\". In 1940, the South Indian Liberal Federation (Justice Party) passed a resolution demanding a sovereign state of Dravida Nadu.\\n\\nPeriyar was clear about the concept of a separate multi-linguistic nation, comprising of Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada areas, that is roughly corresponding to the then existing Madras Presidency with adjoining areas into a federation guaranteeing protection of minorities, including religious, linguistic, and cultural freedom of the people. The proposition was made with a view to safeguarding the national self-respect of Dravidians threatened by Indo-Aryan culture, language, political leadership, and business interests. A separatist conference was held in June 1940 at Kanchipuram when Periyar released the map of the proposed Dravida Nadu. With the promised grant of full self-government after World War II, and posed another threat to the Indian Freedom Movement However, it failed to get British approval. On the contrary, Periyar received sympathy and support from people such as Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah for his views on the Congress, and for his opposition to Hindi. They then decided to convene a movement to resist the Congress. By the 1940s, Periyar supported Muslim League's claim for a separate Pakistan, and expected its support in return. In an interview with the Governor of Madras, Jinnah, the main leader of Muslim League, said that India should be divided into four regions: Dravidistan, Hindustan, Bengal and Pakistan; Dravidistan would approximately consist of the area under the Madras Presidency. Jinnah stated \"I have every sympathy and shall do all to help, and you establish Dravidistan where the 7 per cent Muslim population will stretch its hands of friendship and live with you on lines of security, justice and fairplay.\"\\n\\nIn July 1940, a secession committee was formed at the Dravida Nadu Secession Conference held in Kanchipuram. On August 24, 1940, the Tiruvarur Provincial Conference resolved that Dravda Nadu should be an independent state (thani-naadu). The proponents of Dravida Nadu also sought to associate and amalgamate Tamil Islam within a supposedly more ancient Dravidian religion, which threatened the Islamic identity of Tamil Muslims, some of whom had earlier supported the demand for a sovereign Dravida Nadu movement.\\n\\nIn August 1941, Periyar declared that the agitation for Dravida Nadu was being temporarily stopped. The reason cited was that it was necessary to help the government in its war efforts. The agitation would be renewed after the conclusion of the war. Even though the agitation for Dravida Nadu was being stopped, the demand was very much intact. When the Cripps Mission visited India, a delegation of the Justice Party, comprising Periyar, W. P. A. Soundarapandian Nadar, Samiappa Mudaliar and Muthiah Chettiar, met the members of the Cripps Mission on March 30, 1942, and placed before them the demand for a separate Dravidian nation. The demand was rebuffed by Cripps, who told them that such a demand would be possible only through a resolution in the Madras legislature or through a general referendum.\\n\\nIn August 1944, Periyar created a new party called Dravidar Kazhagam out of the Justice Party, at the Salem Provincial Conference. The creation of a separate non-Brahmin Dravidian nation was a central aim of the party. In 1944, when Periyar met the Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar to discuss join initiatives, Ambedkar stated that the idea of Dravidistan was applicable to entire India, since \"Brahminism\" was \"a problem for the entire subcontinent\".\\n\\nAt the Dravidar Kazhagam State Conference in Tiruchi in the 1940s, prominent Tamil leader C. N. Annadurai stated that it was necessary to divide India racially to prevent \"violent revolutions\" in future, that according to him, had been prevented due to the British occupation of India.\\n\\nOn July 1, 1947, the separatist Tamil leaders celebrated the \"Dravida Nadu Secession Day\". On July 13, 1947, they passed a resolution in Tiruchirapalli demanding an independent Dravida Nadu. On July 16, Mahatma Gandhi expressed his opposition to the demand. Also in 1947, Jinnah refused to help Periyar to help create a Dravidastan.\\n\\nWhen India achieved Independence in August 1947, Periyar saw it as a sad event that marked the transfer of power to \"Aryans\", while Annadurai considered as a step towards an independent Dravida Nadu, and celebrated it. Over the time, disputes arose between the two leaders. They fell out after Periyar anointed his young wife to as his successor to lead the party, superseding senior party leaders.\\n\\nthumbIn 1949, Annadurai and other leaders split up and established Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Annadurai was initially more radical than Periyar in his demand for a separate Dravida Nadu. In highlighting the demand for Dravida Nadu, the economics of exploitation by the Hindi-speaking, Aryan, Brahminical North was elaborated upon. It was contended that Dravida Nadu had been transformed into a virtual marketplace for north Indian products. And, thus, Annadurai explained that to change this situation, a separate Dravida Nadu must be demanded. Throughout the 1940s, Periyar spoke along the lines of a trifurcation of India, that is dividing the existing geographical region into Dravida Nadu, Muslim India (Pakistan), and Aryan Land (Hindustan). In public meetings that he addressed between March and June 1940, he projected the three-nation doctrine as the only solution which could end the political impasse in the country.\\n\\nIn 1950, Periyar stated that Dravida Nadu, if it comes into being, will be a friendly and helpful state to India. When the political power in Tamil Nadu shifted to the non-Brahmin K. Kamaraj in the 1950s, EVR's DK supported the Congress ministry. In late 1950s and early 1960s, the Dravida Nadu proponents changed their demand for an independent Dravida Nadu to an independent Tamil Nadu, as they didn't receive any support from the non-Tamil Dravidian-speaking states. Periyar changed the banner in his magazine Viduthalai from \"Dravida Nadu for Dravidians\" to \"Tamil Nadu for Tamils\".\\n\\nThe reorganization of the Indian states along linguistic lines through the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 weakened the separatist movement. In June–July 1956, the founder of Kazhagam, E. V. Ramaswamy , declared that he had given up the goal of Dravida Nadu.\\n\\nHowever, by this time, DMK had taken over from DK as the main bearer of the separatist theme. Unlike Khalistan and other separatist movements in Republic of India, DMK never considered violence as a serious option to achieve a separate Dravida Nadu.\\n\\nDMK's slogan of Dravida Nadu found no support in any state of India other than Tamil Nadu. The non-Tamil Dravidian speakers perceived the ambitions of the Tamil politicians as hegemonic, ultimately leading to the failure of the Dravida Nadu concept. Even in Tamil Nadu, the common people did not seriously support the idea of a separate Dravidian state. C. Rajagopalachari, the former Chief Minister of Madras State, stated that the DMK plea for Dravida Nadu should not be taken seriously.\\n\\nthumbThe decline in support for the Dravida Nadu within the DMK can be traced back to as early as the Tiruchi party conference in 1956, when the party decided to compete in the Tamil Nadu state assembly elections of 1957. E.V.K. Sampath, who was leading a faction within DMK, argued that Dravida Nadu was \"not feasible\". However, the party did state Dravida Nadu as a \"long-range goal\" during the elections. The political observers doubted the seriousness of their demand for a sovereign state, and stated that the demand for a separate Dravida Nadu was just a side issue, and a slogan to catch the imagination of an emotional public. In the 1957 elections, DMK managed to win only 15 of the 205 seats in the state assembly.\\n\\nIn 1958, V. P. Raman, a Brahmin leader, joined the party and became a strong opponent of the Dravida Nadu concept. In November 1960, the DMK leaders, including Raman, decided to delete the demand of Dravida Nadu from the party programme at a meeting held in absence of Annadurai. Political scientist Sten Widmalm writes, \"It seems that the more the party distanced itself from the demand for Dravida Nadu, the more it was supported.\" In the 1962 election, DMK more than tripled its seats, winning 50 seats to the State Legislative Assembly, but still could not displace the Congress from power.\\n\\nOn September 17, 1960, a \"Dravida Nadu Separation Day\" was observed, which resulted in arrests of Annadurai and his associates. The demand for a sovereign Tamil state was considered as a threat of Balkanization to India, and also raised concerns among the Sinhalese politicians in Sri Lanka. In 1962, a Sinhalese M.P. stated in the Parliament: \"The Sinhalese are the minority in Dravidistan. We are carrying on a struggle for our national existence against the Dravidistan majority.\"\\n\\nAnnadurai, who had been elected to the upper house of Indian parliament (Rajya Sabha) in 1962, reiterated DMK's demand for independence for Dravida Nadu in his maiden speech on May 1, 1962. However, at the time of Sino-Indian War of 1962, he proclaimed that his party would stand up for the integrity and unity of India. A faction of DMK contended that the party should publicly abandon the demand for Dravida Nadu.\\n\\nIn 1963, on the recommendation of the Committee on National Integration and Regionalism of the National Integration Council, the Indian parliament unanimously passed the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which sought to \"prevent the fissiparous, secessionist tendency in the country engendered by regional and linguistic loyalties and to preserve the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity\" of India. This was essentially in response to the separatist movement demanding a sovereign Dravidistan.\\n\\nAt a party conference in 1963, DMK formally dropped the secessionist demand, but also asserted that it will continue to address the issues that led it frame its demand for separation earlier. The Sino-Indian war doesn't seem to be a decisive factor in dropping the demand for Dravida Nadu; prominent DMK leaders Era Sezhiyan and Murasoli Maran have stated that the demand for Dravida Nadu had been dropped in practice before 1962. Maran explained that the there was not really enough support for Dravida Nadu in Tamil Nadu at the time, and it was concluded that there was no use pursuing the demand. He declared \"I am Tamil first but I am also an Indian. Both can exist together provided there is space for cultural nationalism.\" Era Sezhiyan declared that it was impossible to continue to demand Dravida Nadu when the policy lacked support even in the Tamil-speaking areas, let alone Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam-speaking areas. Sezhiyan was a member of the committee that wrote the new party programme, which omitted the demand for Dravida Nadu. Sezhiyan stated that it was more practical to demand a higher degree of autonomy for Tamil Nadu instead.\\n\\nAfter DMK decided to relinquish its demand for Dravida Nadu, it devoted more attention to the language issue (anti-Hindi agitations), and the 1962 election figures were almost exactly reversed in the subsequent 1967 elections. In 1962, the Congress had won the majority of seats, while DMK managed to win only 50 seats. In 1967, DMK won a clear majority of 138 seats, while Congress won only 50 seats. DMK came to power with Annadurai as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.\\n\\nIn 1980s, a minor militant organizaton called Tamil Nadu Liberation Army revived the demand for Dravida Nadu, when the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) was sent to Sri Lanka.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dreadwind", "body": "Dreadwind is the name of several fictional characters from the various Transformers universes.\\n\\nDreadwind was a pessimist, constantly taking the \"glass is half empty\" view (somewhat reminiscent of the Stunticon Dead End). The other Decepticons, bar Darkwing, avoid him, as they know he'll only depress them more. While Dreadwind does inspire dread on the battlefield, this only gets him even further down. Dreadwind transforms into an F-16 Fighting Falcon jet. His partner is the Nebulan Hi-Test. Hi-Test is the polar opposite of Dreadwind, who enjoys danger, and tries to get his partner to cheer up. \\n\\nThe peaceful planet of Nebulos had earlier been visited by the Autobots and Decepticons in Marvel Comics’ Transformers series, and when they departed, only ruin was left in their wake. To prevent such horrors from occurring again, Nebulan scientist Hi-Q detonated a bomb in the planet’s atmosphere which “poisoned” the planet’s various fuel supplies and resources – although harmless to Nebulans, the “poison” was toxic to Transformers. This was the fate which befell Dreadwind and Darkwing when they came to the planet looking for the departed Scorponok, and refueled from Nebulan resources, causing their bodies to cease functioning. Their rotting, immobile hulks soon became tourist attractions.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Hi-Q’s jealous partner, Hi-Test, had vowed to outdo his contemporary, and hired criminal Throttle to steal Hi-Q’s latest fuel conversion theories, which he had dubbed the “Powermaster Process.” Using this data, Hi-Test bio-engineered his and Throttle’s bodies, and offered partnership to Dreadwind and Darkwing, who accepted; the two Nebulans transformed into engines and connected to them, supplying them with untainted energy direct from their own bodies. The Powermasters ran roughshod over the planet, but were eventually defeated by a new team of Powermasters, including Hi-Q himself, bonded with Optimus Prime, and exiled from Nebulos.\\n\\nDreadwind and Darkwing soon entered into a partnership with the robot-eating Mecannibals, hiding their own robot nature by dealing through Hi-Test and Throttle, whose job it was to find other robots for the Mecannibals to feast upon. Setting their sights upon Autobot Pretenders Landmine and Cloudburst, the Decepticons lured them into the Mecannibals clutches, but in a strange twist of fate, the Pretenders were sent to gather spices to improve their flavour. Dreadwind and Darkwing pursued them to make things difficult, but when the fact that they were robots was revealed to the Mecannibals, Landmine and Cloudburst departed while Dreadwing and Darkwind fled.\\n\\nThe Mecannibals pursued the two Powermasters to Cybertron, where they took an assignment from Megatron to acquire the body of the deceased Decepticon, Starscream, hoping it would allow them to shake off their pursuers. Heading to Earth, they discovered that the energies of the Underbase that had destroyed Starscream continued to animate his corpse, but when Throttle and Hi-Test drained them away, they took the body back to Megatron for revival as a Pretender. Megatron’s subsequent apparent death put the duo out of work, however, and they drowned their sorrows at Maccadam’s Old Oil House, where they remained drunkenly unaware of some Mecannibals that had picked up their trail being dispatched by the Autobot Quickswitch. \\n\\nDreadwind and Darkwing participated in the attack on Unicron when the chaos-bringer assaulted Cybertron, and survived to serve under Bludgeon’s leadership. \\n\\nDreadwind appeared in issue #77 \"Exodus!\" where he was among the Decepticons who backed Bludgeon's plan to conquor an inhabited world for the Decepticons once they abandoned Cybertron, rather than go with the Autobot plan to start from nothing on an uninhabited world. \\n\\nThey aided in the raid on planet Klo, where they were seemingly killed the Autobot Getaway.\\n\\nOf the two, Dreadwind was a particular favorite character of series writer Simon Furman, and served a long stint as the character who answered reader’s queries on the letters page of the U.K.’s exclusive Transformers title.\\n\\nThe U.S. animated series was canceled before Dreadwind was produced, so he did not appear in the series, however, the redeco of Dreadwind, known as Buster, appeared as a regular in the Masterforce series in Japan. Dreadwind's only true appearance in animated form was in the commercials for Powermaster toys. \\n\\nDreadwind was among the Decepticons featured in the 1988 book and audio adventure Autobot Hostage by Ladybird books. \\n\\nAlthough Dreadwind and Hi-Test did not appear in any fiction by Dreamwave Productions they did get a full bio in their More Than Meets The Eye series. This bio describes Hi-Test as an over-achieving former scientist who annoys his both partner and Darkwing.\\n\\nBased on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel U.K. and Generation 2 comics). Dreadwind, now without his Powermaster or his partner Darkwing, is one of the troops commanded by Bug Bite, under the ultimate command of Bludgeon. In this story he retains his usual pessimistic attitude, noting that Darkwing had been left with Bludgeon's troops, and that Hi-Test had been killed by Grimlock. He was the only one to see the spying Mirage, and blasted him. After Megatron's forces were implanted with cerebro shells and subsequently broke free, Dreadwind was seen holding Scrapper up with one hand, asking \"Why doesn't anyone like me?\". \\n\\nDreadwind appeared in Withered Hope by Fun Publications.\\n\\nDreadwind made his first IDW Publishing appearance in The Transformers: Stormbringer, where he was part of an infiltration cell on the planet Nebulos under Darkwing's command. When Thunderwing arrived, Dreadwind and the other Decepticons did their best to stop him, but when Ruckus, Crankcase and Roadgrabber were destroyed by the monster, Dreadwind and Darkwing both fled.\\n\\nDreadwind was part of the Robots in Disguise who did not appear in the anime series, but was added to the toy line by Hasbro just prior to the Transformers: Universe line of redecos. \\n\\nDreadwind did not appear in any fiction, but he did get a biography in the 3H Enterprises club magazine. There were plans to make him part of the Decepticon forces under the command of Megazarak in the Transformers: Universe story, but when 3H lost the Transformers license, these plans were never realized. \\n\\nDreadwind is depicted as a merciless powerful one-robot juggernaut who uses Smokejumper's amazing targeting systems to reign down missiles on his opponents. \\n\\nThis version of Dreadwind is the mirror universe version of the Generation 1 character and a member of Megatron's heroic Decepticon forces. Darkwind and Dreadwind seem to be stand-up comedians. According to the author of the character he is based on classic comedians Stan Laurel and Bud Abbott. \\n\\nHe can turn into a jet. In jet modes he and Darkwind combine into Dreadwing. \\n\\nDarkwind and Dreadwind were executed by the Autobots in Around Cybertron from issue #27 of the Transformers Collectors Club magazine. \\n\\nThe toy for Transformers: Robot Masters Smokesniper was repainted as Shattered Glass Dreadwind.\\n\\n"}

He joined Brentford in October 1998 for a transfer fee of £100,000 and was sold within a month for the same fee to Peterborough United. He stayed at Peterborough for just over 2 years, making 35 league appearances and scoring eight goals. After spells on loan at non-league Nuneaton Borough, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Stevenage Borough during the 1999–00 and 2000–01 seasons, he joined Kidderminster Harriers on a one-month loan in January 2001 and then joined Kidderminster on a permanent basis in February 2001. Broughton made over 100 league appearances for Kidderminster, scoring 19 goals, before joining Southend United in June 2003 on a two-year contract after being released by Kidderminster on a free transfer. And scored perhaps his most famous ever goal against their Essex rivals Colchester United in the League Trophy Area Final of 2004, sending Southend United to the first National Final of their then 98 year history.

Each lock was timber floored, and built to accommodate \"Driffield Sized\" Humber keels of 61 ft length and 14 ft 6\" beam (18.6m x 4.4m). Keels could carry a maximum of 100 tons but were limited to a maximum of 70 tons in the Navigation due to draft limits.\\n\\nTrade in the early years did not develop as rapidly as had been hoped. Many of the problems to the development of traffic in these early years stemmed from the restrictions imposed by the Hull Bridge, near Tickton, and the shallow depth of the navigation due to silting. These factors, coupled with the short period of time either side of high tide that vessels could gain access to the Navigation through Snakeholme Lock, made the need for modification to the Navigation obvious.\\n\\nDredging was performed down to Aike Beck, and rather than build a new lock further downstream, the lock at Snakeholme was made into a staircase. This lower chamber with a deeper cill allowed vessels to use it over a greater range in water levels. The Commissioners also wanted to extend the Navigation down to Hull Bridge, but the Beverley Corporation - the owners of the bridge - opposed the suggestion.\\n\\nIn 1801, after a prolonged stoppage at Hull Bridge, an act was created to improve the Navigation. This allowed the Commissioners to rebuild Hull Bridge within 6 years, to build a new lock at Struncheon Hill, and to create a new lock cut. Hull Bridge was replaced in 1803, and the other works completed in 1805.\\n\\nTraffic increased, and even with the advent of the railway in 1846, the canal continued to flourish. However by 1870, trade started to fall off. By 1922 the tolls were £714 and the profits £88. In 1931 receipts were £414 and the profits down to £11.\\n\\nWith less traffic, lower profits, and little prospect of a growth in trade, maintenance standards fell. By 1937 the Locks and Bridges were in a poor state of repair. A report in 1939 records that the canal was weedy throughout its entire length. Water began to leak through the Banks between Whinhill and Snakeholme Lock and a real danger to the surrounding land drainage was evident. Some dredging was carried out during the early 1940s but this did little to improve the condition of the Canal. The last commercial craft to reach Driffield was the Keel CAROLINE loaded with 50 tons of wheat on 16 March 1945. The last commercial craft on the Navigation was the vessel OUSEFLEET, delivering coal to Frodingham Wharf during the period to December 1951.\\n\\nWith the demise of commercial navigation, the interest of the Commissioners waned. In 1955 an unauthorised fixed bridge was built across the navigation at Whinhill but the IWA received the assurance that, if at any future date the navigation was reopened to Driffield, the bridge would be removed. The major obstruction to the renewal of the navigation to Driffield was incurred in 1967, when the County Council replaced the bridge which carries the public right of way over the Navigation at Wansford with a fixed bridge. As this action was taken without the agreement of a quorum of Commissioners the legality of the step must be questioned. Only a Court could adjudicate on this action.\\n\\nIn 1968 the Driffield Navigation Amenities Association was formed to help restore the canal back to navigation. All of the original Commissioners had died, and as no new ones had been appointed, there was no legal ownership of the navigation. The Amenities Association therefore set up a charitable trust, which the Charity Commissioners recognised, and the trustees of the Driffield Navigation Trust became the new commissioners, with responsibility for the waterway. This paved the way for the two organisations to begin restoring the waterway in 1978. Volunteers kept the remaining navigation structures working to allow navigation to Brigham, and North Frodingham, but in the last few years grants have been available to restore new sections.\\n\\nIn 1996 Town Lock was restored completely by volunteers and fund raising. This effort helped to obtain further grants, and in 2003 two major obstacles were officially opened. Brigham swing bridge, last opened in the 1960s and then replaced by a fixed structure in the 1970s was restored to full operation. This allows navigation to Snakeholme Lock,  away. Snakeholme lock was official opened later the same year, though a fixed bridge over the tail of the lock limits headroom to . There are plans to replace it with a swing bridge.\\n\\nIn 2005, Whinhill Lock was restored, and opened to navigation. Unfortunately another fixed farm access bridge has been placed over the lock chamber, and limits use to boats of  in length or less.\\n\\nThe necessary funding to restore the lock at Wansford was secured in mid 2008 and work commenced later the same year. The first priority was the creation of a flood relief channel (bywash) around the south side of the lock to carry the excess flow during periods of heavy rain. This work was completed in autumn 2008. The final stages of the restoration were completed during spring and early summer of 2009. The new gates were installed during April and May and considerable restoration work was carried out on the north wall of the lock chamber. The stop planks were removed and lock commissioned on 30 May 2009 with the first boat in over 60 years entering the lock.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dromomeron", "body": "Dromomeron (meaning \"running femur\") is a genus of lagerpetonid dinosauromorph archosaur from Late Triassic-age rocks of the Southwestern United States. It is known from partial remains, largely from the hindlimbs,, which indicate an animal with an overall length of less than 1.0 meters (3.3 ft). It is described as most closely related to the earlier Lagerpeton of Argentina, but was found among remains of true dinosaurs like Chindesaurus, indicating that the first dinosaurs did not immediately replace related groups.\\n\\nDromomeron and type species D. romeri is based on GR 218, a complete left thigh bone from the Hayden Quarry at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico. The rocks there are in the lower portion of the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation, and are Norian in age. Additional hindlimb bones, some probably from the same individual, are also known, and a partial skeleton has been recovered from Hayden Quarry, but has not yet been fully prepared. A few other specimens have been recovered from nearby localities, including the Snyder Quarry. The bones of Dromomeron are most similar to those of the older dinosauromorph Lagerpeton, and the two animals have been classified together in a clade Lagerpetonidae. The species name romeri honors influential 20th century vertebrate paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer. \\n\\nAlso found at the Hayden Quarry are the remains of phytosaur, aetosaur, rauisuchia, and several types of dinosaurs and dinosaur relatives, including a Silesaurus-like animal, the herrerasaur Chindesaurus, and an unnamed coelophysoid theropod. Finding the remains of four types of dinosaurs and dinosaur relatives (including Dromomeron itself) is noteworthy because it shows that dinosaurs did not immediately replace related groups; that some of these groups, like the lagerpetonids, persisted for longer than previously known and diversified; and that dinosaurian replacement may have occurred at different times in different areas.\\n\\nOther specimens from the Chinle Formation of Arizona and a roughly contemporaneous part of the Dockum Group of Texas also have been assigned to this genus.

{"title": "Dropped ceiling", "body": "thumbright\\n\\nA dropped ceiling is a secondary ceiling, hung below the main (structural) ceiling. They may also be referred to as a drop ceiling, false ceiling, or suspended ceiling, and are a staple of modern construction and architecture. The area above the dropped ceiling is called the plenum space, as it is sometimes used for HVAC air return. The plenum space is also very commonly used to conceal piping, wiring, and/or ductwork.\\n\\nA typical dropped ceiling consists of a grid-work of metal channels in the shape of an upside-down \"T\", suspended on wires from the overhead structure. These channels snap together in a regularly spaced pattern – typically a 2×2 or 2×4 foot grid in the US, or 600×600 mm grid in Europe. Each cell is filled with lightweight \"tiles\" or \"panels\" which simply drop into the grid. Tiles can be selected with a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, or mineral fibres, and can come in almost any color. Light fixture, HVAC air grille, and other fixtures are available which can fit the same space as a tile for easy installation. Most tile material is easily cut to allow fixtures in other shapes, such as incandescent light, speakers, and fire sprinkler heads.\\n\\nThe suspended ceiling was originally developed to conceal the underside of the floor above and to offer acoustic balance and control in a room. The acoustic performance of suspended ceilings has improved dramatically over the years, with enhanced sound absorption and attenuation. This is sometimes achieved by adding insulation known as Sound Attenuation Batts (SABs), more commonly referred to as \"sound batts\", above the panels to help deaden sounds and keep adjacent rooms quieter.\\n\\nThe dropped ceiling was invented by Donald A. Brown of Westlake, Ohio in 1958, who was killed in a plane crash on January 18, 2010.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nAn older, less common type of dropped ceiling is the concealed grid system. This type of dropped ceiling employs a method of interlock panels into each other and the grid, thus making it difficult to remove panels to gain access above the ceiling without damaging the installation or the panels. Normally, these type of ceilings will have a \"key panel\" (usually in the corner) which can be removed, allowing for the other panels to be slid out of the grid one by one, until eventually removing the desired panel. This type of ceiling is more commonly found in older installations or installations where access to above the ceiling is generally considered unnecessary.\\n\\nThis system has some major disadvantages over the more common \"drop panel\" system, most notably the difficulty in removing and reattaching panels from the grid, which in some cases can cause irreparable damage to the panels removed. Finding replacement panels for this type of dropped ceiling is becoming increasingly more difficult as demand for them is slowing, as is production of the parts.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumb\\n\\nThe space above the dropped ceiling is often used as a plenum air return for ventilation systems, requiring only enclosed ducts that deliver fresh air into the room below. Return air enters the ceiling space through open grilles across the ceiling.\\n\\nIn the event that the dropped ceiling is used as a plenum, low-voltage cables and wiring not installed inside conduit need to use a special low-smoke and low-toxicity wire insulation which will tend to char and stop burning on its own. This helps to protect building occupants so that they are not poisoned with toxic chemicals sucked through the ventilation system in the event of a fire, and helps to prevent fires from spreading inside the hidden plenum space. This special low-smoke cable is typically referred to as plenum cable or Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH or LS0H) cable. While networking cable is most the common form of plenum cable, coaxial cable and telephone cable also needs to be plenum-rated for safety.\\n\\nIn earthquake prone areas (e.g., California) diagonal wire stays are often required by building codes in order to ensure the ceiling grid won't sway laterally during an earthquake, which can lead to partial or total collapse of the ceiling grid on the occupants below during a severe tremor. Compression posts may also added to keep the ceiling from bouncing vertically during an earthquake.\\n\\nLighting fixtures and other devices installed in a dropped ceiling are required to be firmly secured to the dropped ceiling framework. In the event of a fire above a dropped ceiling it is often necessary for firemen to have to pull down the ceiling in a hurry to quickly gain access to the conflagration. Loose fixtures merely resting in the framework by force of gravity can become unseated and swing down on their armorflex power cables to hit the firemen below. Binding the fixtures to the framework assures that if the framework must be pulled down the fixture will come down with it and not become a pendulous swinging hazard to the firemen.\\n\\nIn commercial and industrial settings, this allows the obscuring of fittings above the ceiling and access at any time. Drop ceilings may also be used in settings where obscuring fittings or the actual ceiling itself is desirable when wanting to hide problems, such as structural damage. Older, white panels combined with fluorescent lighting are common in many offices, and considered utilitarian, if not unpleasant by some people. More expensive, modern dropped ceiling styles are gaining popularity. \\n\\nIf fire safety is a factor, ceiling tiles made from mineral fibres, or fire-rated wood panels can be used within the construction to meet acceptable standards/ratings. These same tiles can provide the needed additional resistance to meet the \"time rating\" required for various fire code, city ordinance, commercial, or other similar building construction regulations. Fire ratings for ceiling panels vary based on the materials used and preparation of each panel.\\n\\nAnother advantage of a dropped ceiling is that the easily-removed ceiling panels offer instant access to the plenum, greatly simplifying repairs or alterations.\\n\\nWiring and piping installed behind traditional plaster or wallboard ceilings is extremely difficult to modify once the finished ceiling is in place. Wires must either be fished through hollow spaces in the walls behind the finished ceiling, or the ceiling must be demolished in order for wiring or piping changes to be made.\\n\\nIn contrast, the tiles and other parts of a drop ceiling are easily removed to allow access to the area above the grid to do any necessary wiring or plumbing modifications. In the event of remodeling, nearly all components the grid can be dismantled and reassembled somewhere else. \\n\\nIn business, the drop ceiling is often used in conjunction with hollow steel studs to construct small office spaces out of a much larger cavernous space. Wiring and other services are run through the open ceiling, down through the hollow stud walls, and to outlets in the work areas. If business needs change, the office spaces are easily dismantled and the overall cavernous space reconfigured with a different floorplan.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nOne disadvantage with this ceiling system is reduced headroom. Clearance is required between the grid and any pipes or ductwork above to install the ceiling tiles and light fixtures. In general, a minimum clearance of four to eight inches is often needed between the lowest obstruction and the level of the ceiling grid.\\n\\nDropped ceilings are frequently used by slumlord to hide structural and cosmetic damage, loose wiring, insect/rodent infestation, avoiding the need to carry out any repairs or maintenance. Additionally, sometimes walls do not extend past the grid to the actual ceiling. This can present a security risk when used in offices or areas where unauthorized entry may be an issue.\\n\\nAs a renovation tool, dropped ceilings are a quick and inexpensive way to repair a ceiling or reduce HVAC costs, however they tend to show their age quickly they are sometimes discolored by excessive smoking, sag in the center, and are damaged easily. In older buildings that have seen multiple renovations over time, it is not uncommon for a dropped ceiling to have been installed in one renovation and then subsequently removed in another, its installation having been an inexpensive fix to prolong the time between major renovations.\\n\\n"}

In 1985, Wilfried Krutzsch transferred three species of the \"D. echinosporus group\", creating the new combinations Nepenthes echinatus, N. echinosporus, and N. major. However, at more than 40 µm in diameter, the tetrads of D. major are larger than those of any known extant Nepenthes, and within the lower range of extant Drosera tetrads. Pollen from the Kerguelen Islands originally described as D. spinosus has also been interpreted as belonging to Nepenthes.\\n\\nSome authors consider D. major and D. parvus as synonyms of Nepenthidites laitryngewensis of the Palaeocene Lakadong Sandstone in Laitryngew, Khasi Hills, Meghalaya, India.\\n\\n"}

William de Irwyn (of the Irvings of Bonshaw clan) was armourbearer/secretary (and neighbor) to King Robert the Bruce. Drum played a role in the Covenanting Rebellion (as did nearby Muchalls Castle) leading to its being attacked and sacked three times.\\n\\nrigh castle is surrounded by late 18th century gardens, including a rose garden and arboretum containing trees from all regions of the 18th century British Empire.\\n\\nToday, the castle is owned by the National Trust for Scotland and is open during the summer months.

That march used the Elsick Mounth, one of the ancient trackway crossing the Grampian Mountains; the situation of the Elsick Mounth terminating at a ford to the River Dee is thought to have been instrumental in the strategic siting of Drum Castle as a point to monitor traffic on the Elsick Mounth.  lying west of Netherley.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Duck confit", "body": "rightright\\n\\nDuck confit () is a French dish made with the leg of the duck.While it is made across France, it is seen as a speciality of Gascony. The confit is prepared in a centuries-old process of preservation that consists of salt curing a piece of meat (generally goose, duck, or pork) and then poaching it in its own fat.\\n\\nTo prepare a confit, the meat is rubbed with salt and garlic, then covered and refrigerated for up to 36 hours. Salt curing the meat acts as a preservative.\\n\\nPrior to cooking, the salt is brushed off the meat and it is patted dry. The meat is then placed in a cooking dish deep enough to contain the meat and the rendered fat, and placed in an oven at a low temperature (170 – 275 Fahrenheit/ 76 - 135 degrees Celsius). The meat is slowly poached at least until cooked, or until meltingly tender, as little as 90 minutes or as long as 10 hours.\\n\\nThe meat and fat are then removed from the oven and left to cool. When cool, the meat can be transferred to a canning jar or other container and completely submerged in the fat. A sealed jar of duck confit may be kept in the refrigerator for up to six months, or several weeks if kept in a reusable plastic container. To maximise preservation if canning, the fat should top the meat by at least one inch. The cooking fat acts as both a seal and preservative and results in a very rich taste. Skipping the salt curing stage greatly reduces the shelf life of the confit.\\n\\nConfit is also sold in cans, which can be kept for several years. The flavourful fat from the confit may also be used in many other ways, as a frying medium for sautéed vegetables (e.g., green beans and garlic, wild or cultivated mushrooms), savory toasts, scrambled eggs or omelettes, and as an addition to shortcrust paste for tarts and quiches.\\n\\nA classic recipe is to fry or grill the legs in a bit of the fat until they are well-browned and crisp, and use more of the fat to roast some potatoes and garlic as an accompaniment.The potatoes roasted in duck fat to accompany the crisped-up confit is called pommes de terre à la sarladaise. Another accompaniment is red cabbage slow-braised with apples and red wine.\\n\\n"}

The jury returned a verdict against Dun &amp; Bradstreet in the contractor's favor and awarded both compensatory and punitive damages. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, however, moved for a new trial, and the trial court granted the motion.

Chinatown was concentrated in a single block in the southwestern corner of Duncan. At its largest point, Duncan's Chinatown included six Chinese families and 30 merchants supplying loggers, millworkers and cannery and mine workers. As immigration laws became more restrictive, businesses closed and the buildings became run down. The city tore the buildings down in 1969 to build a new law courts complex. Some materials from the original buildings was used at Whippletree Junction.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, Duncan was linked to the 1985 bombings at Narita Airport in Japan and aboard Air India Flight 182, Canada's largest murder case. Resident Inderjit Singh Reyat purchased bomb parts and a radio used to conceal a bomb at Duncan stores. Less than two weeks prior to the bombings, Reyat and suspected Air India mastermind Talwinder Singh Parmar were observed testing explosives in the woods outside of Duncan by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).\\n\\nThe railroad continues to cross Duncan as does the Trans-Canada Highway. The city is about 50 kilometres from both Victoria to the south and Nanaimo to the north. Although the City of Duncan has a population of less than 5000 it serves the Cowichan Valley, which has a population of approximately 78,000, many of whom live in North Cowichan contiguous with Duncan, giving Duncan a much larger \"greater\" population than that contained within the strict city limits. People in areas of North Cowichan bordering on Duncan use \"Duncan\" as their mailing address. Duncan is the seat of the Cowichan Valley Regional District. It derives the name from Quw’utsun’ > Khowutzun > Cowichan, literally translated from Coast Salish into \"The Warm Land\".\\n\\nDuncan's tourism slogan is \"The City of Totem\". The city has 80 totem pole around the entire town, which were erected in the late 1980s, including the world's largest totem pole (in diameter), carved by First Nations artisan Simon Charlie.\\n\\nDuncan has a large First Nations community and is the traditional home of the Cowichan Tribes, who are the largest band among the Coast Salish people. The Coast Salish men and women of the Cowichan Tribes are makers of the world famous Cowichan Sweaters.\\n\\nDuncan is home to the BC Forest Discovery Centre. Before the U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute, Duncan and the whole Cowichan Valley were a thriving lumber centre in British Columbia.\\n\\nDuncan has the world's largest ice hockey stick, officially recognised by Guinness World Records on July 14, 2008, which is on display on the side of the local (formerly known) arena- the Cowichan Community Centre. The centre is now called The 'Island Savings Centre', (in 2008 Island Savings entered into a 10 year/one million dollar naming rights agreement with the CVRD). The stick was made specifically for Expo 86 in Vancouver, and purchased by Duncan at the end of the event.\\n\\nVancouver Island University (formerly Malaspina University-College) has a regional campus in Duncan that offers programs and courses in university transfer, access, trades and applied technology, health and human services, and career and academic preparation. The campus also has a Continuing Education department that offers certificate programs, personal and professional development courses, and online courses. A new  campus is currently under development and will be open for classes in 2011.\\n\\nDuncan has one public secondary school, Cowichan Secondary School, as well as several elementary and middle schools. It also has one private secondary university preparatory school, Queen Margaret's School, established in 1921 which has a co-ed junior school included. There is also an independent Catholic school, Queen of Angels which continues up to Grade 9. The city is also home to Duncan Christian School. The head offices for School District 79 Cowichan Valley are also located in Duncan.\\n\\nIn 2007 the city of Duncan deemed copyright privileges of the totem poles in the city. The use of the totems images in any form require the City of Duncan's approval.\\n\\nDuncan is the home city of the British Columbia Hockey League's Cowichan Valley Capitals, who play in the Island Savings Centre.\\n\\nPublic transit is provided by the Cowichan Valley Regional Transit System.\\n\\n''See also :Category:People from Duncan, British Columbia\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dundee and Arbroath Railway", "body": "The Dundee and Arbroath Railway was a railway link between those two towns in Scotland which ran along the banks of the River Tay.\\n\\nThe railway company received its Parliamentary Act on 19 May 1836. It was planned as a  gauge railway, because, at that time, it was expected to be a purely local railway with no connection to the national network. The main part of the line, some  from Arbroath to a temporary terminus at Craigie, opened on 6 October 1838. A  extension to Roodyards, at the east end of Dundee, opened on 3 June 1839, and the final section, of only  from Roodyards to Trades Lane opened on 2 April 1840.\\n\\nIt soon became clear that the railway could not remain isolated from the rest of the network, and on 19 May 1845 a conference was held in London between representatives of the Dundee &amp; Arbroath Railway, the Dundee &amp; Perth Railway and the Arbroath &amp; Forfar Railway to agree how to provide through traffic over the three railways.\\n\\nThis required the line to be converted to standard gauge, which took place on 6 July 1847. Then, on 23 December 1847, a connecting line at Arbroath was opened, which linked it to the Arbroath &amp; Forfar Railway.\\n\\nIn May 1848 the short branch from Broughty Ferry to Broughty Ferry Pier opened. This formed the northern terminal of the ferry service across the Firth of Tay from Ferryport-on-Craig, which was operated by the Edinburgh &amp; Northern Railway. This branch closed when the Tay Bridge opened.\\n\\nOn 31 August 1848 the Dundee and Perth Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament to lease the company, with the latter being renamed as Dundee and Perth and Aberdeen Railway Junction Company. Although the Dundee &amp; Perth Railway operated the Dundee &amp; Arbroath line, and paid rental to the Dundee &amp; Arbroath company, the lease was never executed, and the arrangement was dissolved on 9 March 1850. The Dundee &amp; Arbroath worked its own undertaking again from that date.\\n\\nThe original terminus station in Dundee, Trades Lane station, was replaced by the new Dundee East station on 14 December 1857.\\n\\nOn January 31, 1862 it was absorbed into the Scottish North Eastern Railway. On 1 February 1880 (as a result of an Act of Parliament on 21 July 1879), the line passed jointly to the Caledonian Railway and North British Railway, which in turn became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway and London and North Eastern Railway respectively as a result of the 1923 grouping.\\n\\nWith the exception of the short spurs for the stations at Dundee East, Broughty Ferry Pier and Arbroath West, the line is still open, with passenger services operated by First ScotRail and East Coast.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dunnage", "body": "Dunnage is a term with a variety or related meanings. Typically dunnage is inexpensive or waste material used to protect and load securing cargo during transportation. Dunnage also refers to material used to support loads and prop tools and materials up off the ground such as jacks, pipes, and supports for air conditioning and other equipment above the roof of a building. \\n\\nWhen unloading a ship, sometimes there is a problem as to what to do with the dunnage. Sometimes the dunnage cannot be landed because of customs duties on imported timber, or quarantine rules to avoid foreign insect pest getting offshore, and as a result often the unwanted dunnage is later furtively jettison over side and adds to the area's driftwood problem. According to U.S. and International Law (MARPOL73/78) it is illegal for ships to dump dunnage within  of the shore. Presently, the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), an international regulatory agency, mandates its 134 signatory countries to comply with the ISPM 15, which requires all dunnage to be heat treated or fumigated with pesticides and marked with an accredited seal. Several instances where foreign insects have entered land have caused devastation to the ecosystem, even ruining crops and causing famine in Africa.\\n\\nthumbthumbDunnage bags are air-filled pouches that can be used to stabilize, secure and protect cargo during all sorts of transportation. Dunnage bags are placed in the void between the cargo items. Dunnage bags can be used in all modes of transportation, whether on the road, railway, ocean or in the air. This makes them a versatile load securing product to prevent a load from moving during transport.\\n\\nOriginally rubber bags were used to brace pallets inside trucks. They later evolved into kraft paper bags with a plastic bag interior. As the use of metal strapping became less popular, many companies now use polyethylene or vinyl- based bags because of their low cost. Extremely important in the use of dunnage bags is that the size of the bag is determined by the void. If this does not match, the dunnage bags will not do their work properly with potential for large damage to cargo and people.\\n\\nStarting in the 1950s, several U.S. railroad freight carriers started rostering boxcars equipped with load-securing devices to prevent shifting during transit. These cars were usually labeled \"Damage Free\" or simply \"DF\" on their sides. The interior loaders helped to negate the use of customer-supplied dunnage.\\n\\nDunnage for securing cargo in holds of ships has evolved from wooden boards forming \"cribs\" to modern mechanical, spring loaded post-and-socket systems, exemplified by the \"pogo sticks\" used on US Navy Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ships which provide underway replenishment of stores, spares, repair parts, ammunition, ordnance, and liquids in cans and drums. Dunnage segregates cargo in the hold and prevents shifting of the cargo in response to ship motions.\\n\\nOutfitters and mule packers use the term dunnage when they transport freight, such as camping gear and food supplies, but do not carry passengers. In fishing net products \"dunnage\" may refer to a reinforcement of the edges of the net. It is sometimes mistakenly believed to be a nautical term for sewage.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Durham Huskies", "body": "The Durham Huskies are an ice hockey franchise based in the town of Durham, Ontario, Canada. The team is actually a series of teams that have spanned nine decades and through an uncountable series of leagues. The Huskies have existed under of couple short lived moniker before finding their name by accident in the 1950s. This team has spanned the Junior, Intermediate, and Senior levels of Ontario hockey.\\n\\nFounded around 1920, the Durham Hockey Club participated in the Ontario Hockey Association Intermediate League. The league was divided into numerous small divisions in which each club would have two home-and-homes with. The team with the top record after this round robin moved on to the provincial playdowns.\\n\\nTheir inaugural season, 1920–21, had the Durham Hockey Club competing against Markdale, Owen Sound, and Wiarton in OHA Group 14 of the Intermediate division. The season would end with the Club earning their historic first victory but still finishing last tied with Owen Sound.\\n\\nAs members of Intermediate Group 16, the 1928-29 Durham Hockey Club competed against Markdale and Flesherton. In their four game schedule, the Club went undefeated. In the first round of the playoffs they met Walkerton who beat them 7-6 and 5-2 to win the series 12-goals-to-8. In 1930-31, the Club was moved into a division with Walkerton and Owen Sound, still referred to as Group 16. Durham had one win and three losses and was eliminated from playoff contention. At the same, Durham's junior team won the Northern Hockey League's junior hockey championship.\\n\\nIn these infantile years, many OHA clubs played a second season after the OHA season was done. This season was played under the league name: the Northern Hockey League. The Durham Hockey Club played in both leagues.\\n\\n1935-36 marked the year that the Durham Hockey Club won its first ever Senior OHA Championship. Coached by Dr. Royden Burnett, this team went the distance and took home the last championship this organization would see until the 1950s.\\n\\nDuring the 1951-52 season, the Durham Hockey Club was competing in the Western Ontario Hockey Association Intermediate \"A\" League. The Club was dominant, but a reporter from the town's local paper, The Chronicle, felt the team was missing a name. He attempted to give them names like the \"Hornets\" and the \"Phantoms\", but nothing stuck. Possibly by mistake, near the end of the 1952 playoff run, The Chronicle ran an article calling the Club the \"Huskies\". The name stuck and the team won its first championship in over a decade. The team repeated their championship run in the 1952-53 season, but at the senior level, again fell dormant. The Intermediate Huskies took over from there, winning the OHA \"B\" championship in 1953-54 and 1955-56. After the success of the early 50s, even the Intermediates fell off the map for a short while. It took until the 1967-68 season for the Intermediates to win the OHA again. The Huskies repeated the next year, and then disappeared from the history books.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, the Senior Huskies became the premier \"Huskies\" team. The 70s also marked the founding of their hometown counterparts, the Durham 72's. The Huskies moved up to Intermediate \"A\" in 1971 and to Senior \"B\" in 1972. One year later they joined the upstart Continental Senior \"B\" Hockey League, which jumped up to Senior \"A\" in 1975. Durham won the Continental crown in Senior \"B\" 1973-74 and Senior \"A\" in 1975-76. The Huskies won the 1974 title by defeating the Stratford Perths 4-games-to-2 in the league and provincial final. Two years later, the Huskies advanced past their league championship to compete in the Allan Cup playdowns for the first time in their history, but did not manage to win the Ontario Hockey Association title, losing to the Barrie Flyers 4-games-to-none. Barrie made it all the way to the Allan Cup final where they were defeated 4-games-to-none by the Spokane Flyers. They Huskies found a great rivalry in the Continent league with the Lucan-Ilderton Jets and the Stratford Perths.\\n\\nThe Continental league took over the OHA Senior \"A\" name in 1980 when the original Senior \"A\" league collapsed. Durham dropped down to Intermediate \"A\" in 1982 and to Intermediate \"B\" in 1983. When the intermediate class of hockey was eliminated, Durham was regrouped into Senior \"B\". Later this level became known as Senior \"AA\" while Senior \"A\" became Senior \"AAA.\" Through the proficient play of perennial leading scorer Dean Neuman, former NHL Jim Roberts, and goaltender John Bak, the team won the Senior \"B\" crown in 1984-85 and Central league titles in 1984, 1985, and 1986.\\n\\nIn 1990, the Huskies, then members of the Central Senior B Hockey League, were promoted to the top tier of Ontario Senior Hockey as their league merged with the Southern Ontario and Seaway-Cyclone leagues to create the Southwestern Senior A Hockey League. As a member of the league, the Durham Huskies became eligible to compete for the Allan Cup for the second time in their seventy year history. The Huskies left the league in 1992 as they were unable to field a team. Today, the league is now known as Major League Hockey.\\n\\nThe team chose to disband in 1992 due to various reasons, leaving Durham for the first time in seventy years without a team from the franchise originally called the \"Durham Hockey Club\". But in 1996, the Huskie moniker was once again utilized as the Metro Junior A Hockey League allowed for the expansion of a Durham Huskies Junior \"A\" Hockey Team. Since 2001, no Durham team above the \"Minor\" level has been known as the Durham Huskies.\\n\\nIn remembrance of two of the greatest teams in Durham hockey history, the 1989 Greater Ontario Senior \"AA\" champion Durham Huskies who made it to the Hardy Cup semi-finals will play off against the 1989 WOAA Intermediate Grand Champion Durham Thundercats on April 4, 2009 in a 20th Anniversary Alumni game.\\n\\n''Note: GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against''\\n\\nMore seasons will be added as more information is uncovered.\\n\\nA note of interest: the Intermediate level was abolished in the late 1980s as the entire Senior and Intermediate system fell apart. Since then, the Ontario Hockey Association has rewritten the accolades of championship Intermediate level teams to read as Senior level championships. As well, the championship tiers were revised from two classifications with three tiers each (Sr. A, B, C and Int. A, B, C) to one classification with four tiers (Sr. AAA, AA, A, and B) instead. As an example, instead of the Huskies being OHA Intermediate \"C\" champions in 1985, the OHA now considers them the OHA Senior \"A\" Champions.

{"title": "Durham Stevens", "body": "Durham White Stevens (February 1, 1851, Washington, D.C. March 25, 1908, San Francisco, California) was an American diplomat and later an employee of Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His shooting death at the hands of Korean American assassins Jang In-hwan and Jeon Myeong-un led to his being described as \"the first victim of Korea terrorism\".\\n\\nStevens grew up in Washington, D.C. He enrolled as an undergraduate at Ohio's Oberlin College, from which he graduated in 1871; he then returned to his hometown to study law at Columbian University and Howard University , and was admitted to the bar association of the District of Columbia in 1873. His career with the Department of State began in October of that same year, when President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him secretary of the United States Legation at Tokyo, where he served under then-United States minister to Japan John Bingham. He enthusiastically accepted his new position, in part due to his fondness for learning new languages; he had previously studied Latin, Greek, French, and German. He was initially one of only three staff members at the Legation. He served as secretary until July 1883, and also took up the post of Charge d'Affairs ad interim in 1878-79, while Bingham was on home leave. After resigning his post, he returned to the United States.\\n\\nIn November 1883, Stevens entered the service of the Japanese Government as English Secretary to the Imperial Legation at Washington, a position which he obtained thanks to the influence his former superior Bingham had with the Japanese government. In 1884 he was ordered to Tokyo for service in the Foreign Office. In the winter of 1884-85 he accompanied Count Inoue Kaoru to Korea to assist in negotiations related to the murder of several Japanese citizens on Korean soil; for services rendered on that occasion, the Emperor Meiji awarded him with the Third Class of the Order of the Rising Sun. He was Bureau du Protocole of an 1885-87 Tokyo conference aimed at the renegotiation of unequal treaties imposed on Japan by Western countries; following the conference, he returned to Washington, D.C. with the rank of Honorary Counsellor of Legation. He served under Count Mutsu Munemitsu, then-Minister at Washington; during that time, he assisted in the negotiation of the treaty with Mexico, which was the first treaty made by Japan fully recognizing her right to exercise all the sovereign powers of an independent state.\\n\\nSoon after the start of hostilities in the First Sino-Japanese War, Stevens published an article in the North American Review, in which he sought to justify the war by asserting that the \"dry rot of Chinese conservatism\" blocked Korea's development, and that a reduction of Chinese influence in Korea and a corresponding increase in Japanese power would result in social and commercial reform. For services rendered during the war, he received the Second Class of the Order of the Sacred Treasures. He travelled twice to Hawaii to represent Japanese interests there, once in 1901 and again in 1902. He was also decorated two more times by the Japanese government, the third time receiving the Second Class of the Order of the Rising Sun, and then in October 1904, the fourth time, being awarded the Grand Cross of the Sacred Treasure.\\n\\nIn November 1904, Stevens was appointed as adviser to the Korean Foreign Office. The Japanese government had urged the Korean government to appoint him to this position on the basis of the 1901 recommendation of Horace Allen. Stevens ignored several requests that a Korean consul be appointed in Hawaii; despite this, in 1905, Allen also commended Stevens to F.M. Swanzy, president of the Hawaii Sugar Planters' Association; Swanzy was interested in seeing Korean emigration to Hawaii restarted. The Japanese government expected that Stevens supported their efforts to block Korean emigration to Hawaii, but he was initially open to the idea. He had several meetings with Swanzy in Tokyo in mid-1905 on the subject, but in the end, Swanzy's efforts were unsuccessful. Later that year, he issued a statement that Japan would welcome legislation restricting the entry of Japanese immigrants into the United States, and that they were also in favor of stopping movement to Hawaii, \"provided it can be done in a manner that would not be offensive to Japan or that would not affect her dignity\"; he stated that the Japanese government hoped to induce potential emigrants to settle in Korea or northeast China instead. While officially under the employ of the Joseon government, he continued to receive tens of thousands of dollars in payments from the Japanese in order to \"advance Japanese propaganda\" among the American people, according to South Korea's Ministry of Patriots' and Veterans' Affairs.\\n\\nIn early 1906, Stevens made a bet with Kiuchi Jūshirō, a Japanese official resident in Korea, about the length of time before Japan would annex Korea. Kiuchi expected it would only take three years; Stevens' guess of five years would prove to be more nearly correct, as the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty was signed in mid-1910. However, Stevens would not survive to see his prediction come true.\\n\\nStevens returned to the United States in March 1908 to visit his family in Washington, D.C. and vacation with his sisters at a cottage they owned in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Upon his arrival, he gave an interview with a San Francisco newspaper in which he stated that the common people of Korea were benefiting from the increasing Japanese presence in their country. These statements provoked the ire of two local associations of Koreans, the Daedong Bogukhoe and the Gongnip Hyeophoe, who held a joint meeting in which they agreed that something had to be done about Stevens. On March 22, 1908, four Korean men chosen by the associations accosted Stevens at the Fairmont Hotel, where he was staying. Their leader, a man by the name of Earl Lee who was described as fluent in English, asked him if he had indeed made the statements attributed to him in the newspaper, and whether \"Japanese were not killing off the Koreans\". He answered yes to the first question and no to the second, then proceeded to tell Lee that he had \"probably been too long away from his country to know the exact condition of the Government.\" Upon this, the four men began to strike Stevens with chairs, knocking him down and causing him to strike his head against the marble flooring; Stevens backed up against the wall until help arrived. After the assault, Lee was quoted as saying, \"We are all very sorry that we did not do more to him.\"\\n\\nThe following day, Jang In-hwan and Jeon Myeong-un, both Korean immigrants to the United States, approached Stevens at the Port of San Francisco as he prepared catch a ferry to make a rail connection in Oakland and attacked him. Jeon fired his revolver at Stevens first, but missed, and instead rushed at him, using his weapon as a club to hit Stevens in the face. Jang then fired into the melee, striking Stevens twice in the back; Jeon was also shot in the confusion. The crowd which had gathered urged that they be lynched on the spot; Jang was arrested and held without bail on a charge of murder, while Jeon was first hospitalized, and later charged as an accessory. In newspaper interviews after the attack, both Jeon and Jang offered no apology for the assassination, describing Stevens as a \"traitor to Korea\" and stating that \"thousands of people have been killed through his plans\". \\n\\nOne bullet had penetrated Stevens' lung, while another lodged in his groin; however, surgeons at the St. Francis Hospital initially expected that he would be able to make a recovery, and on the day of the attack he was apparently in good enough health to issue a statement to the press that the assault was \"evidently the work of a small band of student agitators in and about San Francisco, who resent the fact that the Japanese have a protectorate over Korea and believe that I am to some extent responsible for this condition of affairs in their country\". However, his condition began to deteriorate on the morning of March 25. His doctors, seeing signs of inflammation in his wounds, placed him under anaesthesia and began to perform surgery at six that evening. He never regained consciousness after that, and died shortly after 11 PM, with Japanese Consul Chozo Koike at his bedside. He was buried in his hometown of Washington, D.C. after a funeral service at St. John's Episcopal Church; Secretary of State Elihu Root was among his pallbearer.\\n\\nNews of Stevens' assassination was greeted with sorrow in diplomatic circles in Japan and among American missionaries in Korea, to whom Stevens was well-known; United States Ambassador to Japan Thomas O'Brien was quoted as saying that \"the utmost grief is expressed by everyone\", adding that he counted Stevens as a \"true and useful friend\". Yale University professor George Trumbull Ladd, in a letter to the editor of The New York Times, denounced the attacks as \"cowardly and shockingly brutal\", calling Koreans a \"bloody race\" and, comparing the Stevens case to a number of other assaults in Korea, such as that against American missionary George Heber Jones, concluded that politically-motivated murders were not \"an isolated or at all peculiar experience\" in Korea, and stated that the events \"furnish an instructive object lesson for the correct estimation of the Korean character and the Korean method of self-government\".\\n\\nJang and Jeon both stood trial for Stevens' murder separately, as there was insufficient evidence to prove they had conspired with each other; Jeon was quickly acquitted of charges. The Korean community hired three lawyers to defend Jang, among whom one, Nathan Coughlan, eventually agreed to take on the case pro bono. During the trial, he planned to use Arthur Schopenhauer's theory of \"patriotic insanity\" to argue that Jang was not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found Jang guilty of second-degree murder on 23 December of that same year. Later Korean accounts describe Stevens as a traitor to Korea and refer to Jeon and Jang as patriots and heroes.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dust mask", "body": "A dust mask is a flexible pad held over the nose and mouth by elastic or rubber straps to protect against dust encountered during construction or cleaning activities, such as dusts from drywall, concrete, wood, fiberglass, silica (from ceramic or glass production), or sweeping. A dust mask is worn in the same fashion as a paint mask or surgical mask, but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each protect against specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong mask for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as many dust masks with widely varied levels of protection may look similar, and even masks that do not protect against dust at all, such as paint mask and surgical mask may look similar to dust masks. Misfitting masks are also a danger as they allow material to bypass the mask entirely. A correct fit may not be as critical in masks that are intended to protect against splattering liquids or mist. Dust masks are manufactured to protect against only certain dangers, and do not protect against chemicals such as vapors and mist. For this reason, it is dangerous to confuse dust masks with paint mask.\\n\\nDust masks are a cheaper, lighter, and possibly more comfortable alternative to respirators, but may not provide as much protection, and may be more susceptible to misuse or poor fit.\\n\\nSome dust masks include improvements such as having two straps behind the head (one upper and one lower), having a strip of aluminum on the outside across the bridge of the nose that can be bent for a custom fit, and having a strip of foam rubber on the inside across the bridge of the nose to ensure a good seal even if the aluminum on the outside does not fit.\\n\\nDust masks that incorporate these improvements into their design often receive the NIOSH N95 rating, which is indicated by the letters \"N95\" being printed directly on the mask, and are often the required rating for masks used by construction worker working around non-poisonous dusts.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Dutch Supercar Challenge", "body": "The Dutch Supercar Challenge is a motor racing series centered on the Benelux. A special feature is that touring cars, GTs and Sportscars can all participate on an equal basis within the same class. Another special feature are the very open regulations. The first time the championship was held was 2001. It replaced the Supercar Cup. \\n\\nA typical race weekend exists of the usual practice on Friday and Saturday, qualifying on Saturday and two races of 45 to 60 minutes with one pit stop of at least 60 seconds. One race is Saturday and one Sunday. The four classes usually run separate races two classes at a time. The two fastest run together and the two slowest run their race. The exception is Spa-Francorchamps where all four classes can run together. All races are started from a rolling start though in the past standing starts have been used as well. \"Success time\" is awarded after every race. First gets 15 seconds, Second 10, third, 5, fourth loses 5 seconds, fifth ten and all below fifth lose 15 seconds. This is added to the time to the minimum pit stop duration. The reason no \"success ballast\" is used is the immense variety in vehicles competing. A 50 kg weight has a much larger effect on a Lotus Elise than it has on a Dodge Viper Competition Coupe even though these can compete in the same class.\\n\\nDuring most of its lifetime the Dutch Supercar Challenge has served as a host to many single make series. In the first two years the Marcos Mantis Cup ran within the GT class. In 2003 it was fully integrated in that class. Starting in 2008 the Mosler Challenge has run in GT. In 2010 three series were added. Those are BRL V6 and the Saker Challenge, not to be confused with the series of the same name the DNRT hosts, both within Supersport I and BRL Light in Supersport II. The BRL series were before separate events and still have a slightly different calendar. The races at Silverstone don't pay them points while the races at the Zolder truck Grand Prix do though to all other classes they don't count.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Duyfken", "body": "Duyfken (also Duifken or Duijfken) (\"little dove\" in English, \"duifje\" in modern Dutch) was a small Dutch ship built in the Netherlands. She was a fast, lightly armed ship probably intended for shallow water, small valuable cargoes, bringing messages, sending provisions, or privateering. The tonnage of Duyfken has been given as 25-30 lasten (50-60 tons). \\n\\nIn 1606, during a voyage of discovery from Bantam (Banten), Java, captained by Willem Janszoon, she encountered the Australian mainland and Janszoon is thus credited with the first authenticated European discovery of Australia.\\n\\nthumbIn 1596 a ship named \"Duyfken\" sailed in the first expedition to Bantam, the crew was captured by the islanders on Pulau Enggano. On 23 April 1601 Duyfken sailed from Texel as the jacht, or scout, under skipper Willem Cornelisz Schouten to the Spice Islands. After reaching Bantam the \"Moluccan Fleet\" consisting of five ships, including the Duyfken, under admiral Wolphert Harmensz, encountered a blockading fleet of Portuguese ships totalling eight galleons and twenty-two galleys. They engaged this fleet in intermittent battle, driving them away on New Year's Day 1602. Thus the undisputed dominance of the Iberians (Portuguese and Spanish) in the Spice trade to Europe was ended.\\n\\nThe fleet received a warm welcome in Bantam, repairs were carried out to damage caused in the battle, and a survey of Jakarta Bay was undertaken, where the Dutch would later build Batavia, their capital in the Indies. Then, sailing by way of Tuban, East Java to the Spice Island of Ternate, cloves were loaded on board and the ship returned to Banda for a cargo of nutmeg. \\n\\nThe Duyfken was then sent on a voyage of exploration to the east when the newly formed United Dutch East India Company (VOC) was granted a monopoly on trade to the Spice Islands by the Dutch government. On the voyage home from the Indies the Duyfken was separated from the larger ships in a storm off Cape Agulhas, southern Africa and reached Flushing in April 1603, two months ahead of the larger ships.\\n\\nOn 18 December 1603 the Duyfken, with Willem Janszoon as skipper, set out on a second voyage to the Indies in the VOC fleet of Steven van der Haghen. The VOC fleet captured a Portuguese ship in Mozambique Channel and sailed to the Spice Islands via Goa, Calicut, Pegu and finally reaching Bantam, Java on New Year's Eve 1604.\\n\\nIn 1605 the Duyfken was in the fleet that recaptured the fort of Van Verre at Ambon in the Spice Islands, from the Portuguese. She was then sent to Bantam, Java for urgently needed provisions.\\n\\nIn 1605 the Dutch East India Company (VOC) sent the Duyfken, captained by Willem Janszoon, to search for trade opportunities in the \"south and east lands\" beyond the furthest reaches of their known world. Willem Janszoon took the ship southeast from Banda to the Kei Islands, then along the south coast of New Guinea, skirting south of the shallow waters around False Cape (Irian Jaya) and then continuing east-southeast.\\n\\nIn early 1606 Janszoon encountered and then charted the shores of Australia's Cape York Peninsula. The ship made landfall at the Pennefather River in the Gulf of Carpentaria. This was the first authenticated landing on Australian soil and for the first time all the inhabited continents of the world were known to the European science of geography. Janszoon is thus credited with the first authenticated European discovery of Australia. The ship sailed back to Bantam.\\n\\nIn 1607 the Duyfken may have made a second voyage east to Australia. Later in the year she was sent to Java to get supplies for the beleaguered Dutch fortress on Ternate. In February or March 1608 the Duyfken was involved in hunting Chinese junks north of Ternate.\\n\\nIn May 1608 the ship was engaged in a five hour battle with three Spanish galleys. In June she was sent with larger ships to capture the fortress of Taffaso on Makian Island. A month later she was brought inside the reef at Ternate for repairs. It seems that she was hauled on her side to repair the bottom but this caused further damage.\\n\\nA full size replica of the Duyfken was built by the \"Duyfken 1606 Replica Foundation\" jointly with the Maritime Museum of Western Australia and launched on January 24, 1999 in Fremantle. She then undertook goodwill tours to Sydney, Queensland, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, South Africa, and finally Texel in Netherlands. While in the Netherlands, the floor of the hold was replaced by antique Dutch bricks. \\n\\nFor a period in 2005, The Duyfken was berthed alongside the Old Swan Brewery on the Swan River in Perth, Western Australia. The replica was open for visits by the public.\\n\\nIn 2006, Western Australia played a big role in the 400th anniversary of the original Duyfken’s visit to Australia and a national group has begun planning to commemorate the arrival of the Duyfken and to mark this important milestone in Australia's history by also giving recognition to all who followed her and contributed to the mapping of the Australian coast.\\n\\nThe Duyfken is currently berthed at the Queensland Maritime Museum in Southbank, Brisbane, Queensland. You can find out more about Duyfken by visiting her website.If you live in Brisbane and would like to volunteer as a guide shipkeeper or help out with some maintenance then please contact us from the details on the website or come down and visit the crew.\\n\\n"}

It lacks the caponier or musketry galleries of the otherwise similar Eastbourne Redoubt. Beyond the moat, an earth bank or glacis helped to protect the masonry from artillery fire. Built on two stories, the upper floor had open emplacements for ten 24 pounder guns mounted on wooden traversing platforms. The lower floor featured twenty four vaulted barrack and storage casemates, which opened onto a circular parade ground. They were designed to accommodate 350 officers and men. Entry was originally via a wooden footbridge supported by stilts, which could be collapsed in an emergency.\\n\\nThe design and purpose of the redoubt were finalised at a conference in Rochester in 1804. It was built between 1804 and 1812 to support a chain of 21 Martello Towers that stretched between Hythe in Kent and Rye in Sussex, and to act as a supply depot for them. It specifically protected the sluices that were the key to the drainage of Romney Marsh. By the time it was finished, the invasion threat was over. During World War I, it was used for troop accommodation, although there was a question in Parliament about the damp conditions. In World War II, the south coast was again at risk of invasion, and two 6 inch breech-loading guns were mounted in casemates built over the original gun emplacements. A prominent battery observation post was built and pill boxes were sited on the parapet in order to repel an infantry attack. It was fully operational by 1942 as an Emergency Coastal Battery. After the war, the observation post was used as a Coastguard lookout and radar was installed to monitor shipping in the English Channel. The army constructed a mock-up of a street of buildings in the interior, for training in urban warfare. The redoubt is now disused except as a store and remains the property of the Ministry of Defence. It is a Scheduled Monument and is listed by English Heritage as a Building At Risk, although a conservation plan has been agreed. It is not open to the public.\\n\\nDymchurch\\n\\n"}

He spent most of his career in India in the Assam Police, rising to the rank of Inspector-General commanding the force. In 1910 he was placed on Special Criminal Investigation duty. In 1911 he returned to England and took up the appointment of Chief Police Officer of the Port of London Police, remaining in this position until his retirement in 1925. For his services in this role during the First World War he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours. After retirement he became Mayor of Croydon.\\n\\nHe was an excellent tennis player and an enthusiastic big game hunter. He lost his left arm to a panther (in Silchar, Assam), was tossed by a gaur and trampled by an Indian rhinoceros during various hunting expeditions.\\n\\nthumbDuring his spare time he studied and collected the bird of India. His books included The Indian Ducks and their Allies (1908), Game Birds of India and Ceylon (1921), Fauna of British India: Birds (1922; seven volumes), Mishmi Man-eater (1928), The Nidification of the Birds of the Indian Empire (1932), and Cuckoo Problems (1942; the cuckoo was his chief interest within ornithology). He made a comprehensive collection of nearly 50,000 Indian birds' eggs, part of which he donated to the Natural History Museum, where he spent a lot of time working on the egg collections from India and Thailand. His seven-volume contribution to the Fauna of British India series became the standard reference work on the subject. Part of the collection, about 152 specimens were sold to the private museum of the Tzar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. He also served on government advisory committees on the protection of birds and was from 1913 to 1936 honorary secretary and treasurer of the British Ornithologists' Union.\\n\\nSome of the nest and eggs in his collection have been considered as of dubious provenance and there are suggestions that he artificially made up some of the clutches. Some like Charles Vaurie have considered it so unreliable that they even suggested the destruction of his egg collection.\\n\\nBaker's Yuhina (Yuhina bakeri) was named in his honour.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "EADS Harfang", "body": "The Harfang , formerly known as Système intérimaire de drone MALE (SIDM, \"Interim medium-altitude, long-endurance drone system\") is a drone system used by the French Air Force, supplementing the RQ-5 Hunter.\\n\\nThe French Air Force purchased her first drones in 1995, with a number of RQ-5 Hunter. The IAI Heron was put on display at the 1999 Paris Air Show and generated some interest; a project to field a derivative was started two years later. On 9 September 2006, a prototype was launched for trials from Istres-Le Tubé Air Base. Trials by the Centre d'essais en vol followed, before transfer of the plane to Mont-de-Marsan Air Base\\n\\nThe drone was originally planned to be delivered to the Air Force for the summer of 2003 as a replacement for the Hunters, which were phased out in September 2004. A number of industrial setbacks delayed the delivery, notably that the satellite communication system did not conform with Air Force requirements. The drones were modified to satisfy the requirements, changing them from an \"off-the-shelf\" product into a custom plane built specially for the French Air Force. The plane and onboard computer are built by Malat, a division of Israel Aerospace Industries, based on the IAI Heron.\\n\\nThe French Air Force ordered three planes and two ground control stations. The SIDM entered service in June 2008 in the Drone Experimentation Squadron 1/330 Adour, in Cognac, a unit of the Centre des expérimentations militaires. A four-phase programme took place between 2008 and 2009:\\n\\nThe Harfang is composed of two main components: the drone and the ground control station.\\n\\nThe Harfang drone is an unmanned airplane propelled by a rear-mounted turbo-supercharged water-cooled flat-four engine, driving a pusher propeller. It features a flapped high wing with anti-icing system, and has a twin boom tail with two vertical surfaces. With a take-off mass of 1.2 tonnes, the Harfang can carry a 250-kg payload to height of 7500 metres for a duration of 24 hours.\\n\\nThe mission pack is a three-sensor sphere stabilised by gyroscope, mounted under the forward part of the fuselage. It contains optronic and IR sensors, a laser designator that doubles as a rangefinder, and a high-resolution, fixed echo suppressing synthetic aperture radar. The radar can be used to observe vehicle movement on the ground under any meteorological condition. The antenna is mounted on the centre of the body.\\n\\nThe Harfang carries an Inertial measurement unit with GPS recalibration, and a differential GPS that provides for automatic take-off and landing capabilities. In case of loss of communications, the drone follows a path that brings it back to its start point, while trying to re-establish contact.\\n\\nThe drone carries an IFF transponder and a flight recorder.The Harfang lacks electromagnetic sensors and is wanting in terms of maneoverability. Its limited speed of 80 knots (148 km/h) makes it slow to reach its mission area. It is also limited by bad weather, notably by icing or high humidity conditions.\\n\\nThe control station is composed of four modules, numbered M1 through M4:\\n\\nA line-of-sight link allows for direct communication up to 150 to 200 kilometres away. Longer ranges utilise a directional antenna and geostationary satellites. The Very High Frequency and Ultra high frequency communication relay provides for links to ground units and air traffic control.\\n\\nOn 14 and 15 September 2008, the Harfang was deployed in Lourdes to provide security for Pope Benedict XVI.\\n\\nIn February 2009, the 3 Harfang were sent to Afghanistan and deployed at Bagram, under Lieutenant-colonel Cyril Carcy. In late March or early April, drone number F-SDAY was damaged when it crashed due to freezing, and possibly to human or software error. Purchase of a fourth vehicle to replace F-SDAY is under consideration, while she is being repaired and redeployed in France for training.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nHarfang\\n\\n"}

{"title": "EA Sports MMA", "body": "EA Sports MMA is a fighting video game which was published by EA Sports and developed by EA Tiburon from 2008 to 2010. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 19, 2010 in North America and October 22, 2010 everywhere else.\\n\\nOn June 1, 2009, Electronic Arts announced that an all-new fighting title is in development under the EA Sports brand. EA Sports MMA was released in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Its website did not reveal any facts about the gameplay or its release date, just one link to sign up for the EA Sports newsletter and another that directs people to EA Sports' MMA forum. However, the Facebook page for the game released steady amounts of videos and preview information leading up to the release. This game has many options to create the ultimate MMA experience. The game focuses on global MMA, not restricting it's gameplay to one brand or region.\\n\\nIt was announced that the first trailer would be shown on CBS, during Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Rogers on November 7, 2009. The trailer featured Emelianenko and Rogers performing a variety of attacks and defenses against each other. The trailer ended with both of the men about to punch each other in the face. It was announced that EA MMA would feature Strikeforce as its flagship promotion.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\nRandy Couture and Fedor Emelianenko are on the US cover. Hidehiko Yoshida and Fedor Emelianenko are on the Japanese cover.\\n\\nThe game will also feature 'Live Broadcasts' that can be viewed from PC or consoles. The player will be able to upload hype videos, which will help to increase popularity. EA Sports will choose the fighters based on their Hype videos and schedule fight cards just like in real life MMA. Real life prizes will be given out to a certain level.\\n\\n Heavyweight\\n\\nLight Heavyweight\\n\\nMiddleweight \\n\\nWelterweight\\n\\nLightweight\\n\\nLegend:\\n\\nUFC president Dana White has declared himself \"at war\" with EA over the development of the EA Sports MMA video game. White assumed that he initially wanted EA to develop UFC 2009 Undisputed and remarks \"EA Sports told us, 'You're not a real sport. We wouldn't touch this thing. We want nothing to do with this.'\" \"We put our asses on the line, THQ and the UFC, to make a video-game deal in the worst economy in the world,\" White told reporters recently. \"We go out there and do this thing, and it's successful, and now [expletive] EA Sports wants to do a video game. \\n\\nIn response to these allegations, EA Sports have since claimed that Dana White held a meeting with EA in Los Angeles, who are responsible for such games as The Sims; a separate entity from their EA Sports brand. Additionally, the fact that EA Sports began development of EA Sports MMA before UFC 2009 Undisputed was initially released led credence to the notion that the development of EA Sports MMA was not reactionary.\\n\\nWhite warned the fighters who intend to be included in the upcoming EA Sports MMA game release, claiming that \"If you do business with EA, you won't be in the UFC\". Former UFC heavyweight champion Tim Sylvia and Andrei Arlovski, as well as still under contract Frank Trigg (who has now been released from his UFC Contract following his loss to Matt Serra ) and Vladimir Matyushenko confirmed their presence in the EA Sports MMA video game. Fan favorite Randy Couture was under contract with UFC before agreeing to be a part of EA Sports MMA, but is able to take part in the game due to never signing over his likeness to the UFC for use in video games. White has since changed his standpoint on this subject.\\n\\nEA Sports MMA launched on October 19, 2010, with a public launch party for fans and media. At the gatherings, UFC Hall of Fame fighter Randy Couture and former Pride champion Fedor Emelianenko, both of which grace the cover of the game, finally got the opportunity to fight each other, albeit via their video gamer personas.\\n\\nInitial reviews have been positive with Metacritic giving the XBox360 version a score of 79% after 55 reviews (78% after 42 reviews for the PS3 version) and Game Rankings giving the Xbox360 version a score of 80.5% after 39 reviews (78.2% after 25 reviews for the PS3 Version). While EA Sports MMA remains a critical success thus far, it hasn't had the same success financially. According to a Cowen & Company analyst, sales of EA Sports MMA have been awful, with analyst Doug Creutz saying it’s “more or less dead on arrival at retail\". First week sales were slow in both Europe and America and to date after 9 weeks on the market EA Sports MMA has only sold 255,420 copies worldwide (108,996 on XBox360 and 146,434 on PS3). In contrast, UFC Undisputed 2010 sold more copies (265,422) just on the Xbox 360 and just in America during the first week of its release.\\n\\nOn October 21, 2010 EA Sports MMA was released as an app for iPhone and iPod Touch. The app is a scaled down version of the game, featuring 24 fighters from five different weight class, create-a-fighter mode and career mode.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "EN 15038", "body": "Many European Translation companies have long felt the need for a reliable method of demonstrating the quality of the services they provide to their customers. Many sought ISO 9001 certification as a demonstration of their commitment to quality management systems. However, as the ISO 9001 standard does not address the sort of translation-specific processes which many translators consider important in determining quality outcomes, this standard did not become widely accepted as a \"guarantee of quality\" in the industry. In 2006, a quality standard, specifically written for the translation industry, EN 15038, was published by CEN, the European Committee for Standardization. This was a serious attempt to provide certification of translation-specific quality management using independent, on-site audits by recognized certification bodies. This standard is gaining acceptance worldwide and the European Union has begun including it as a benchmark in its tender specifications.\\n\\nThere have been a number of initiatives in Europe to create a universal quality standard that could benchmark the quality of the translation services and gain recognition through independent audit certification. This includes the Italian UNI 10574 Standard, the Austrian Önorm D 1200 and Önorm D 1201 Standards, the Dutch Taalmerk Standard and the German DIN 2345 Standard. In 1999 the EUATC (European Union of Associations of Translation Companies) saw the need for developing an industry specific quality standard. This initiative built on previous standards which had been established by some national associations of translation companies. This standard was the first European wide initiative. In 2003 the EUATC took this standard to the next level. They started working with CEN, the European standards body, in April 2003 with the aim of creating a certifiable quality process standard for translation. The public consultation period started in September 2004 and EN 15038 was published by May 2006. The EUATC is made up of national associations of translation companies throughout Europe and these national associations have been translating the standard into their own language and cooperating with their national standardisation bodies for publication and certification by independent third party auditors.\\n\\nThe area not covered by EN 15038 is the interpreting and service matrix. While the committee developing the standard recognised the value of including Interpretation within the scope of the standard, it was felt that managing interpreting quality would make developing the standard more difficult and it would extend the process.\\n\\nWithin the translation industry many words are used to describe different processes from one company to another. It is very important for anyone who intends to implement EN 15038 that they understand the meaning of the terms and definitions used in the standard. The standard also uses the terms ‘should’ and ‘shall’. When the word ‘shall’ is used, it is obligatory while ‘should’ is used for recommended.\\n\\nThe following are some of the terms which are defined in the standard:\\n\\nThe EN 15038 standard set out the: \\n\\nThe appendices provide additional information on project registration, technical pre-translation process, source text analysis, style guides and a non exhaustive list of added value services.\\n\\nThis section outlines the level of competence required by translators and others working on the project, the need for the right technology and communication equipment and the need for a documented quality management system. \\n\\nThe standard sets out steps in the Client – TSP relationship. These include: \\n\\nThis section of the standard is divided in three subsections which deal with Project Management, Preparation and Translation. \\n\\nThe standard states the TSP shall have documented procedures in place for handling translation projects, contact with the client, quality assurance and compliance with the client – TSP agreement. \\n\\nThe sub-section on preparation deals with project registration, project assignment, technical resources, pre-translating process, source text analysis, terminology work and the style guide.\\n\\nThe standard specifies the following steps in the translation process: translation, checking, revision, review, proofreading and final verification.\\n\\nIf a TSP offers any added value service, it should make every effort to apply the same level of quality to those services as to the services covered by the standard.\\n\\nThe EN 15038 is published as the following national standards.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "ESMF", "body": "The ESMF (Earth System Modeling Framework) is open source software for building climate, numerical weather prediction, data assimilation, and other Earth science software applications. These applications are computationally demanding and usually run on supercomputers. The ESMF project is distinguished by its strong emphasis on community governance and distributed development, and by a diverse customer base that includes modeling groups from universities, major U.S. research centers, the National Weather Service, the Department of Defense, and NASA. The ESMF development team was centered at NCAR until 2009, after which it moved to the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory. \\n\\nESMF increases the interoperability of Earth science modeling software developed at different sites and promotes code reuse. The idea is to transform distributed, specialized knowledge and resources into a collaborative, integrated modeling community that operates more efficiently, can address a wider variety of problems more effectively, and is more responsive to societal needs. \\n\\nESMF is based on principles of component-based software engineering. The components within an ESMF software application usually represent large-scale physical domains such as the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, or land surface. Some models also represent specific processes (e.g. ocean biogeochemistry, the impact of solar radiation on the atmosphere) as components. In ESMF, components can create and drive other components so that an ocean biogeochemistry component can be part of a larger ocean component.\\n\\nThe software that connects physical domains is called a coupler in the Earth system modeling community. Couplers follow the mediator pattern and take the outputs from one component and transform them into the inputs that are needed to run another component. Transformations may include unit conversions, grid interpolation or remapping, mergers (i.e., combining land and ocean surfaces to form a completely covered global surface) or other specialized transformations. In ESMF, couplers are also software components.\\n\\nESMF represents user data in the form of data object such as grids, fields, and arrays. The user data within a component may be copied or referenced into these ESMF objects. Once user data is part of an ESMF data object, framework methods can be used to transform and transfer the data as required to other components in the system. This generally happens within a coupler component.\\n\\nGrid interpolation and remapping are core utilities of ESMF. Interpolation weights can be generated in ESMF using bilinear interpolation, finite element patch recovery, and conservative remapping methods. \\n\\nESMF can associate metadata with data objects. The metadata, in the form of name and value pairs, is grouped into packages, which can be written out in XML and other standard formats. ESMF metadata packages are based on community conventions including the Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions and the METAFOR Common Information Model.\\n\\nThe ESMF collaboration had its roots in the Common Modeling Infrastructure Working Group (CMIWG), an unfunded, grass-roots effort to explore ways of enhancing collaborative Earth system model development. The CMIWG attracted broad participation from major weather and climate modeling groups at research and operational centers. In a series of meetings held from 1998 to 2000, CMIWG members established general requirements and a preliminary design for a common software framework.\\n\\nIn September 2000, the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) released a solicitation that called for the creation of an ESMF. A critical mass of CMIWG participants agreed to develop a coordinated response, based on their strawman framework design, and submitted three linked proposals. The first focused on development of the core ESMF software, the second on deployment of Earth science modeling applications, and the third on deployment of ESMF data assimilation applications. All three proposals were funded, at a collective level of $9.8M over a three year period. As the ESMF project gained momentum, it replaced the CMIWG as the focal point for developing community modeling infrastructure.\\n\\nDuring the period of NASA funding, the ESMF team developed a prototype of the framework and used it in a number of experiments that demonstrated coupling of modeling components from different institutions. ESMF was also used as the basis for the construction of a new model, the GEOS-5 atmospheric general circulation model at NASA Goddard.\\n\\nAs the end of the first funding cycle for ESMF neared, its collaborators wrote a Project Plan that described how ESMF could transition to an organization with multi-agency sponsorship for its next funding cycle. Major new five-year grants came from NASA, through the Modeling Analysis and Prediction (MAP) program for Climate Change and Variability, and from the Department of Defense Battlespace Environments Institute. The NSF continued funding part of the development team through NCAR core funds. Many smaller ESMF-based application adoption projects were funded in domains as diverse as space weather and sediment transport. \\n\\nAlso at the end of the first funding cycle, the ESMF collaborators wrote a white paper on Future Directions for the ESMF. This paper formed the basis for a proposal to NSF to combine ESMF (and other software frameworks) with data services to create a computational environment that supports an end-to-end modeling workflow. It was funded and has become the Earth System Curator project.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eagle (song)", "body": "The song \"Eagle\" was recorded in 1977 by Swedish pop group ABBA. It was the first track on the group's fifth album, simply titled The Album and the longest track they ever recorded (at 5:51, 1 second longer than \"The Day Before You Came\" at 5:50). This was the third and last official single from \"The Album, and was released only in a limited number of territories with \"Thank You for the Music\" as the B-side. The song was not released as a single in the UK or US. The song has certain common denominators with E.L.O.'s \"Laredo Tornado\" which appears on their 1974 album Eldorado.\\n\\n\"Eagle\" was written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, with Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad sharing the lead vocals. The recording, which commenced on June 1, 1977, had the working titles of \"High, High\" and \"The Eagle\". Lyricist Ulvaeus was inspired by Richard Bach's novel Jonathan Livingston Seagull when he wrote the lyrics for this song. In later years, music critics have hailed \"Eagle\" as one of ABBA's more outstanding tracks in terms of lyrics, and there is some debate over whether the song is also a tribute to the Eagles, a group that was popular in the 1970s, or simply an ode to the freedom of flight that these birds of prey possess.\\n\\n\"Eagle\" was not a major success on the charts. One reason was that the song was already available on The Album, another was the limited release only in countries like Australia, Austria, Belgium (where it did top the charts), France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland. To make the song more radio-friendly it was heavily edited down from 5:51 to 4:25 by omitting an instrumental break and the 3rd chorus. Australia and France even got an edit from the edit, with the song fading shortly after the 2nd chorus making it last just 3:33, 2:18 shorter than the album version. The single was promoted with a music video by Lasse Hallström, while an earlier, much more interesting video in terms of special effects was included as a part of ABBA: The Movie.\\n\\nThe single was released in May 1978 to fill the gap between the previous single, \"Take a Chance on Me\" & the next, a completely new track, eventually called \"Summer Night City\". The B-side of \"Eagle\", \"Thank You for the Music\", was later released as a single outright in a few countries after the group had disbanded, namely in the UK, where \"Eagle\" had not been released as a single.\\n\\nA music video was produced to accompany the single.\\n\\nThe original 4:25 single edit was issued on CD for the first time in 1993 on the compilation More ABBA Gold: More ABBA Hits. However, for the 1999 re-release of this album, plus subsequent releases, a new version based on the 1978 edit was created. Unfortunately this edit missed out vital instrumentation at the end of the second chorus prior to the closing instrumental, thereby sounding disjointed. The original edit (or at least an exact re-creation of it) was finally issued again on the deluxe version of The Album in 2007.\\n\\n"}

He was a six-time All-Star (1933–38) and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975.\\n\\nBorn in Snohomish, Washington, Averill broke into the major leagues in 1929 (at the age of 27) with the Cleveland Indians. He played for Cleveland for over ten years, and remains the all-time Indian leader in total base, runs batted in, runs, and triples. He also remains 3rd in all-time Indian hits and doubles, and 4th in all-time Indian home run and walks. During his time in Cleveland, the team never finished higher than 3rd. He's famous for hitting the line drive that broke Dizzy Dean's toe in the 1937 All-Star Game. Averill was the first major league player to hit 4 home runs in a doubleheader (with home run in each game) on September 17, 1930; he was also one of the first players to hit a home run in his first major league at-bat (April 16, 1929, opening day).

Riley. His father was a fire bureau captain and his grandfather ran a tannery on Multnomah Stadium (now PGE Park).\\n\\nEarl graduated from the Portland Academy in 1907, attended Oregon State College1908-1910, and later the Holmes Business College in Portland. As a second lieutenant he served at the 4th Officers Training School 1918-1919. He was the superintendent of the Columbia Engine Works machine shop 1919-1931.\\n\\nEarl’s political career began with appointment in 1928 to Portland’s civil service commission, on which he served through 1930. Two years later, while he was serving as a partner in a tire company, he was named to fill a vacancy on the city council. He served on the council as commissioner of finance from 1930-1940. \\n\\nIn November 1940 he won his first election to mayor, and was re-elected in 1944. In 1943, the United States Office of War Information and the British Ministry of Information sent Earl to Europe to tour war torn cities and boost morale as a “typical American mayor”. Perhaps he was a typical American mayor, but in 1945 Earl was charged by the influential City Club of Portland with negligence in stamping out vice and corruption. Two years later the Portland Ministerial Alliance repeated the charges. According to historian E. Kimbark MacColl, Riley had a secret vault in his City Hall office to store his percentage of vice protection payments. In the book Vanishing Portland, the Bottenbergs reported that the Portland police were collecting $60,000 a month in protection payments from gambling and prostitution operations with much of this money going to Earl. Despite denials of laxness in his administration, Earl lost his third mayoral campaign to the reformer Dorothy McCullough Lee.\\n\\nThe Oregonian obituary in 1965 called Earl “a tough, able and demanding administrator and a wizard at municipal financing”. Commissioner William A. Bowes described him as a man willing to work 18 and 20 hours a day.\\n\\nAfter his mayoral loss, Earl told his friends he was through with politics. He acquired a Packard automobile dealership. The business failed when the car ceased production, and he became a car salesman for a competitor, Barnard Motors. He was an active civic leader, with an interest in the Shriner’s Hospital for Crippled Children and the Easter Seals campaigns. Earl retired from business in 1959 after suffering a serious heart attack. \\n\\nEarl was known as a flashy cigar-chewing man. He is described in his draft records as brown haired and blue eyed. Earl met his future wife E. Fay Wade while the two were attending Oregon State College, and they married March 25, 1920.\\n\\nBesides the Shriner’s he also belonged to the American Legion, Moose International, Fraternal Order of Eagles, Rotary International, Woodmen of the World, Royal Order of Jesters, Phi Delta Theta, Neighbors of Woodcraft, the Multnomah Athletic Club, and was a 33rd Degree Freemason. He was also a Baptist. \\n\\nEarl died at the age of 75 of a heart attack at his home on August 17, 1965. He is buried at Portland’s Lone Fir Cemetery. After her husbands death, Fay moved to Richardson, Texas to be with daughter Mrs. Reeves Hoffpauer when her husband died in 1965. Fay died on July 25, 1968 and is buried at Lone Fir Cemetery, next to her husband.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Earl of Buchan", "body": "The Mormaer or Earl of Buchan was originally the provincial ruler of the medieval province of Buchan. Buchan was the first Mormaer in the High Medieval Kingdom of the Scots to pass into the hands of a non-Scottish family in the male line. The earldom had three lines in its history, not counting passings from female heiresses to sons. Today it is held by the Erskine family as a peerage, and the current holder is Malcolm Harry Erskine, 17th Earl of Buchan (b. 1930).\\n\\nThe first recorded person who definitely held the position of mormaer was Gartnait, whose patronage is noted in the Gaelic Notes on the Book of Deer. The latter is the only significant source for the mormaerdom, and its existence makes Buchan one of Scotland's best documented provinces for native cultural institutions. After the death of Fergus, before 1214 , Buchan became the first native mormaerdom to pass into the hands of a foreign family, the Comyns, though only through marriage. Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan inherited and continued his mother's title and line until it was conquered and forfeited during the Wars of Scottish Independence.\\n\\nThe title remained in crown hands until, later in the century, the title went to Alexander Stewart, the \"Wolf of Badenoch\". Buchan by this point, however, but drastically truncated and was no longer a provincial lordship. \\n\\nThereafter it was issued to James Stewart, whose descendants have held the title since. In 1617 the earldom came to James Erskine (died 1640), a son of John Erskine, 2nd or 7th Earl of Mar, whose wife Mary had inherited it from her father, James Douglas (died 1601); and from that time the Erskines have retained the title.\\n\\nAmong the most celebrated of the later earls of Buchan we find the eccentric David Steuart Erskine, 11th earl (1742–1829), a son of Henry David, 10th earl (died 1767), and brother of Henry Erskine (1746–1817) and of Thomas, Lord Erskine. His pertinacity helped in effecting a change in the method of electing Scottish representative peers, and in 1780 he succeeded in founding the Scottish Society of Antiquaries. His correspondents included Horace Walpole, and he produced an Essay on the Lives of Fletcher of Saltoun and the Poet Thomson (1792) and other writings. He died at his residence at Dryburgh in April 1829 , leaving no legitimate children, and the earldom passed to his nephew Henry David (1783–1857), the 12th earl. \\n\\nThe family seat is Newnham House, near Hook, North Hampshire. The Earl holds the subsidiary titles of: Lord Auchterhouse (created 1469), Lord Cardross (1610) and Baron Erskine of Restormel Castle (1806). The former two of these titles form part of the Peerage of Scotland, while the barony belongs to the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The Earls of Buchan sat in the House of Lords by virtue of the UK title until the passage of the Peerage Act 1963.\\n\\nThe heir apparent is the present holder's son Henry Thomas Alexander Erskine, Lord Cardross (b. 1960)\\n\\nEarl of buchan came to broxburn westlothian to donate money to build a school.

{"title": "Early Triassic", "body": "thumbThe Early Triassic is the first of three epoch of the Triassic period of the geologic timescale. It spans the time between 251 ± 0.4 Ma and 245 ± 1.5 Ma (million years ago). Rocks from this epoch are collectively known as the Lower Triassic, which is a unit in chronostratigraphy. The Early Triassic is the oldest epoch of the Mesozoic era and is divided into the Induan and Olenekian ages.\\n\\nThe Lower Triassic series is coeval with the Scythian stage, which is today not included in the official timescales but can be found in older literature. In Europe, most of the Lower Triassic is composed of so called Buntsandstein, a lithostratigraphic unit of continental red beds.\\n\\nThe Permian-Triassic extinction event spawned the Triassic period. The massive extinctions that ended the Permian period and Paleozoic era caused extreme hardships for the surviving species. Many types of corals, brachiopods, molluscs, echinoderms, and other invertebrates had completely disappeared. The most common Early Triassic hard-shelled marine invertebrates were bivalves, gastropods, ammonoid, echinoids, and a few articulate brachiopods. The most common land animal was a small herbivorous synapsid Lystrosaurus. \\n\\nEarly Triassic faunas lacked biodiversity and were relatively homogenous throughout the epoch due to the effects of the extinction, ecological recovery on land took 30M years. The climate during the Early Triassic epoch (especially in the interior of the supercontient Pangaea) was generally arid and dry and deserts were widespread however the poles possessed a Temperate climate. The relatively hot climate of the Early Triassic may have been caused by widespread volcanic eruptions which accelerated the rate of global warming and possibly caused the Permian Triassic extinction event.\\n\\n*\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Early warning radar", "body": "An early warning radar is any radar system used primarily for the long-range detection of its targets, i.e., allowing defences to be alerted as early as possible before the intruder reaches its target, giving the defences the maximum time in which to operate. This contrasts it with systems used primarily for tracking or gun laying, which tend to be shorter range but offer much higher accuracy.\\n\\nThe first early warning radars were the British Chain Home, the US CXAM (Navy) and SCR-270 (Army), and the German Freya. By modern standards these were quite short range, typically about 100 to 150 miles. This \"short\" distance is a side effect of radio propagation at the long wavelengths being used at the time, which were generally limited to line-of-sight. Although techniques for long-range propagation were known and widely used for shortwave radio, the ability to process the complex return signal was simply not possible at the time.\\n\\nStarting in the 1950s, a number of over the horizon radar were developed that greatly extended detection ranges, generally by bouncing the signal off the ionosphere. Perhaps the most capable of these systems was the DEW Line, although other examples have since been built with even better performance. An alternate early warning design was the McGill Fence, which provided \"line breaking\" indication across the middle of Canada, with no provision to identify the target's exact location or direction of travel.\\n\\nToday the early warning role has been supplanted to a large degree by airborne early warning platforms. By placing the radar on an aircraft, the line-of-sight to the horizon is greatly extended. This allows the radar to use high-frequency signals, offering high resolution, while still offering long range. A major exception to this rule are radars intended to warn of ballistic missile attacks, like BMEWS, as the high altitude exo-atmospheric trajectory of these weapons allows them to be seen at great ranges even from ground-based radars.\\n\\n"}

It was given the numerical designation of Earth-721 in the Marvel Encyclopedia Vol. 6: Fantastic Four.\\n\\nOn Earth-A, only two members of the famous Fantastic Four (Reed Richards and Ben Grimm) were aboard Richards' spaceship on the fateful day that the group was exposed to cosmic rays. Afterwards, in an inversion of their status in the primary Marvel continuity (Earth-616), Richards became the rocky, monstrous Thing while Grimm became the pliant Mister Fantastic. Johnny Storm (the Human Torch on Earth-616) was believed to be dead in the Vietnam War, and his sister Susan Storm (the Invisible Girl in Earth-616) married Grimm. The Thing of Earth-616 met this Thing when he was accidentally teleported to Earth-A by the Inhumans' dog Lockjaw.\\n\\nLater, the extra-dimensional warlord Arkon became involved in a scheme to ignite nuclear war on three worlds (Earth-616, Earth-A, and the Fifth Dimension) so that he could use the energy released by the wave to power his own world. The Thing of Earth-A fought Arkon on Earth-616, confusing Alicia Masters, who was romantically involved with the Thing of Earth-616. Meanwhile, Arkon's ally in Earth-616's Roxxon Corporation used Reed Richards' time machine to unleash dinosaurs and other threats into Earth-A. The Fantastic Four learned the truth and, with the assistance of the Reed Richards of Earth-A, halted the war. The Thing of Earth-616 then traveled to the Nexus through which Arkon hads planned to absorb this energy and destroyed it after defeating its guardian, Gaard. Gaard was actually Earth-A's Johnny Storm, who had been saved from death and given superhuman power by Arkon's scientists. After he failed to stop Grimm, he departed into the multiverse.\\n\\nOver the following years, Gaard's power would improve to the level that he could eliminate redundant timelines. He somehow physically transformed or gained a suit of armor, and renamed himself Vangaard. He attempted to destroy the extra-temporal realm of Elsewhen, but was opposed by the Elsewhen-raised superhero Huntara and her teammates in the Fantastic Four-allied team Fantastic Force. When Huntara learned who Vangaard really was, her teammate, Earth-616's Human Torch turned off his flame sheath. When Vangaard saw his own heroic counterpart, he had a change of heart, and decided to assist those wayward timelines instead of destroying them.\\n\\nIn She-Hulk #21, it is revealed that some recent continuity errors are a result of the non-powered Earth-A counterparts of heroes such as She-Hulk, Dr. Strange, Hulkling, and Wiccan traveling to Earth-616 (which they call Earth-B) and acquiring the powers of their 616 counterparts.\\n\\nAll of them had been sent home by the end of She-Hulk vol. 2 #21.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "East Asian Community", "body": "East Asian Community (EAC) is a proposed trade bloc for the East Asia countries that may arise out of either ASEAN Plus Three or the East Asia Summit (EAS).\\n\\nSee Economy of East Asia\\n\\nThe idea of establishing a trade community within East Asia has had a long history . Beginning in the 1940s, Japanese occupation in East Asia was followed up by the creation of an Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere consisting of Asia nations. This idea was unsuccessful as it largely existed as an ideology to allow Japan to exploit the rest of Asia and partly instigated the Pacific theatre of World War II. However, the intention of Asian integration did not end following the Japanese defeat. \\n\\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was formed on 8 August 1967 by the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore, as a display of solidarity against communist expansion in Vietnam and insurgency within their own borders.\\n\\nIn 1990, Malaysia proposed a creation of an East Asia Economic Caucus composed of the then-members of ASEAN (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand), the Peoples' Republic of China, Japan, and South Korea. This was also a failure since it faced strong objections from Japan and the United States\\n\\nAfter a series of failures, ASEAN and its neighbors created another regional grouping the ASEAN Plus Three, established in 1997 and institutionalised in 1999. The significance of this grouping was demonstrated in the response to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. ASEAN Plus Three appeared to take the role of community building in East Asia. \\n\\nIn 1999, a Joint Statement on East Asia Cooperation was issued on the topic of East Asian integration by ASEAN. \\n\\nIn 1998, ASEAN Plus Three established The East Asian Vision Group of eminent persons which reported in 2001. In turn in 2001 the East Asian Study Group was established. In 2002, ASEAN Plus Three received the Final Report of the East Asian Study Group. This included a recommendation to establish an East Asia Summit.\\n\\nAs a result, the status of ASEAN Plus Three is unclear with the existence of the more recent East Asia Summit established in 2005 following this process and involving all the members of ASEAN Plus Three, together with India, Australia and New Zealand, otherwise known as ASEAN Plus Six.\\n\\nAfter the EAS was established the issue arose of whether any future East Asia Community would arise from the EAS or ASEAN Plus Three. Malaysia felt that it was still the case that the role of the community building fell to ASEAN Plus Three shortly before the second EAS despite \"confusion\". China apparently agreed whereas Japan and India felt the EAS should be the focus of the East Asian Community.\\n\\nAfter the first EAS the feasibility of EAS to have a community building role was questioned with Ong Keng Yong, the secretary-general of ASEAN being quoted as describing the EAS as little more than a \"brainstorming forum\" Nevertheless the Chairman’s Press Statement for the Seventh ASEAN Plus Three Foreign Ministers’ Meeting Kuala Lumpur, 26 July 2006 said\\n\\nIt appeared that over time following the first EAS the focus was less on whether the EAS has a role in community building than on what the role was and whether it was secondary to ASEAN Plus Three. By mid-2006 the Chinese news site Xinhua Net suggested the community would arise through a two-phase process with ASEAN Plus Three as the first phase and the EAS as the second phase. The China-India joint declaration of 21 November 2006 linked, at paragraph 43, the EAS with the East Asian Community process.\\n\\nThe concentric circle model of the community process with ASEAN at the centre, ASEAN Plus Three at the next band and the East Asia Summit at the outer band is supported by the Second Joint Statement on East Asia Cooperation Building on the Foundations of ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation which said:\\n\\nThe Chairman's Statement of the 3rd East Asia Summit Singapore, 21 November 2007 also states:\\n\\nA first stage of a future community may be seen in the Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia (CEPEA) proposed by Japan for the members of the East Asia Summit. The reality appears however that movement towards such a relationship is a long way off. Lee Kuan Yew has compared the relationshiop between South-East Asia and India with that of the European Community and Turkey, and has suggested that a free-trade area involving South-East Asia and India is 30 to 50 years away \\n\\nThe concept of the community, if not the details, was promoted during the Japanese general election, 2009 campaign. After the change of government in Japan the details of what Japan was proposing was unclear. \\n\\nThe Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada in early October 2009 indicated that what was proposed was a Community based on the members of the East Asia Summit focusing on political links with a common currency \"very far off in the future\". The Japanese proposal is for a regional trade grouping. This proposal was based on the 16 member countries of the East Asia Summit. \\n\\nThe subsequent ASEAN Plus Three and East Asia Summit meetings did not clarify what role or shape the community would have.\\n\\nThe Chairman's Statement for the ASEAN Plus Three meeting stated:\\n\\nASEAN Plus Three was noted as \"a\" main vehicle whereas earlier language had been \"the\".\\n\\nThe Chairman's Statement Fourth East Asia Summit stated:\\n\\nIn addition to these proposals India also has its proposal for an Asian Economic Community.\\n\\nThe Chairman's Statement of the 16th ASEAN Summit (9 April 2010) stated:\\n\\nBy mid-2010 the leaders of the three nations referred to in the October 2009 statement had all changed: Japan and Australia had changed Prime Ministers due to internal political issues and the Philippines had gone through a Presidential election for which the incumbent was ineligible. ASEAN nevertheless continued to discuss the issues of regional structures.\\n\\nThe shape of the East Asia Community remains something to be defined in the future. The issues being explored at this stage deal with whether there will be a Community which must be resolved prior to understanding what it will look like.\\n\\nSome have linked the EAS with a future broader Asian Economic Community like the European Community. However some commentators see this an overly optimistic vision and it is plainly in the very distant future if it is to occur - the European Community has taken decades to reach its current shape, had greater early drive for its creation and more coherence between its members (ASEAN alone is composed of democracies, dictatorships, capitalist tax havens and communist states).\\n\\nOn any view community building is not a short term project. However after the second EAS the Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh was confident that the EAS would lead to an East Asia Community. China had also apparently accepted this was the case.\\n\\nIf achieved the Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia (CEPEA) would be a tangible first step in the community building process. The Second EAS and Third EAS seems to have increased confidence in CEPEA but is still only a proposal .\\n\\nFor the moment currency union, as distinct from the Asian Development Bank proposed Asian Currency Unit, is not even being pursued within ASEAN, much less the broader members of the EAS.\\n\\nThe idea of a pan-Asian trading bloc has been proposed given the potential for the economic benefits that may be produced from such structures in light of the success of European Community (now the European Union), and ASEAN Free Trade Area.\\n\\nIt is economics perhaps more than anything else which is driving the discussion. The India External Affairs Minister Shri Pranab Mukherjee was quoted as saying in February 2007:\\n\\n \\n\\nA view also supported by the Indian Defence Minister Shri A.K.Antony the next day:\\n\\n \\n\\nHence it can be seen that fear of large international trading bloc is driving this discussion.\\n\\nThe Third EAS approved the establishment of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia to further investigate economic integration between the EAS members.\\n\\nThe cultural, religious, language and ethnic groupings in the EAS are diverse. There is also great disparity in the size and level of development in the economies and in the populations of the nations involved. Plainly the level of support within the EAS for such an ambitious role for the EAS is mixed. \\n\\nThe Japanese Government has proposed an exchange program over the five years from 2007 to 2011 with up to 6,000 youths per annum visiting Japan from EAS member countries.\\n\\n"}

Unlike previous years the event was not televised, and instead, a TV special was broadcast with scenes (venues, award show, various hotel antics).\\n\\nHalifax, Nova Scotia once again hosted ECMA, a year early, as a result of a request to flip from the Fredericton, New Brunswick location. The Halifax event, introduced as the East Coast Music Awards, Festival and Conference, measures as a major industry and financial success. An amazing and insightful four-day conference, with record attendance, wonderful venues and things on the technical end (sound and lights), and an ever growing international program with over 50 international music industry delegates. With 500 hotel rooms in two adjoining Delta hotels, there was a festival atmosphere in the hotels and adjoining malls. The 2007 award show was regarded by many as one of the best ever. The show marks the recent passing of East Coast legends John Allan Cameron, Dutchie Mason and Denny Doherty. ECMAfest brought the downtown Halifax to life with many official and partnered stages.\\n\\nECMA returned to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island in 2006. Charlottetown has been a laboratory from which such experiments as RadioECMA, Soundwaves and the 72 Hour Jam have sprung. For the first time ever, 2006 organizers decided to have a gala dinner industry awards ceremony on Saturday night. The controversial Trailer Park Boys hosted a great award show at the Civic Centre, proving many skeptics wrong and the organization right on the mark. A major highlight of 2006 was that a festival was created within the Delta Prince Edward host hotel. The music, business and networking went virtually around the clock.\\n\\nECMA 2005 in Sydney, Nova Scotia, was a great success and helped to kick off the opening of two new, multi-million dollar facilities in Sydney. For both the Membertou Trade and Convention Centre and the Sydney Marine Terminal, ECMA was the first major event to use their facilities, and offered a great opportunity to introduce them to the community and the international industry delegates attending the conference. The conference was taken to a new level with very popular sessions, a vibrant international program (50+ delegates) and successful partnering with Cape Breton University. Overall, ECMA is moving towards a master class format, presenting classes this year in songwriting, export readiness and musical scoring for gaming and television. The success of the Soundwaves was built upon with the creation of a brand new program, Sound-off, which involved schools across Cape Breton to select the best band in their school and advance them to regionals and a final competition.\\n\\nECMA 2004 in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador saw international delegates. A strategic partnership was developed with the Atlantic Film Festival, and film and TV elements were introduced to the conference. A number of East Coast recording artists negotiated contracts for national licensing and distribution deals. The ECMA Songwriter’s Circle was broadcast live across the country on CBC Radio and across Atlantic Canada on CBC Television.\\n\\nECMA 2003 in Halifax, NS brought the conference back to where it all began 15 years before, and to celebrate this anniversary, the entire city came alive with music and was transformed into a City of Stages, celebrating all genres of music. It was a resounding success, having played host to over 2000 delegates. The Soundwaves Program brought music to over 30,000 young school students throughout the region, and corporate sponsorship and support for ECMA reached new heights. Halifax celebrated Urban Music with an Urban Music Series featuring hip-hop, R&B and the Black Vibes concert. ECMA 2003 brought international bookings to several East Coast artists as European music industry professionals were in attendance.\\n\\nSaint John, New Brunswick hosted ECMA 2002. The competitive bid process in New Brunswick sparked community involvement and led to over 2200 delegates to attend. Saint John brings new initiatives: the wildly popular Roots Room for acoustic performances, the UniSon bilingual concert, and the bluegrass stage that attracts an estimated 5,000 fans. In addition to the national CBC Television broadcast of the awards show, the MuchMusic ECMA Rock stage got a prime-time special on Much, and CBC radio's Definitely Not The Opera broadcasted live from the main showcase stage.\\n\\nCharlottetown attracted more than 1,700 delegates and highlighted the diversity of the East Coast Canadian music scene. Emerging and established artists came together in a barrage of new showcases, including the debut of the Jazz/Classical Concert Series. The event fostered renewed interest in the formation of the P.E.I. Music Awards and creates “Soundwaves,” a program that sees musicians visiting schools throughout the province, and hospitals, businesses and churches in Charlottetown. The Ennis Sisters sign with Warner Music and the ECMA Award Show receives another Gemini Award for Best Music, Variety Program or Series.\\n\\nSydney, Nova Scotia hosted a grassroots event that pushed its organizational and infrastructure capacities to the limit. A economically successful event paved the way for the ECMA to regain a sound financial footing – and it commemorates the influence of Cape Breton’s Celtic Music family, including the late John Morris Rankin. Showcases abound, and events like Radio FreECMA and the Continuous Jam ignite industry attention. The awards show receives a Gemini Award for Best Music, Variety Program or Series.\\n\\nThe Awards have been dominated by several groups/artists over the years. The top ten by wins and then nominations are as follows:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "East End, Houston", "body": "The East End, controlled by the Greater East End Management District (GEEMD), is a district in eastern Houston, Texas, United States, located between the eastern edge of downtown to the Port of Houston and South to Hobby Airport. The district is home to Houston's early history and industry and is the site of Harrisburg, the seat of government for the Republic of Texas in 1836. East End consists of many different ethnic groups, including Hispanic, Asian, White, and African American. Latinos make up more than half of the 100,512 residents, The area includes two of Houston’s oldest Hispanic neighborhoods, Magnolia Park and Second Ward.\\n\\nThe East End is bounded on the west by downtown Houston and on the east by the Port of Houston. Buffalo Bayou flows past the site of Harrisburg, an early Texas trading post and seat of government for the Republic of Texas in 1836. Founded by John Harris, for whom Harris County is named, Harrisburg was initially considered by the Allen brothers for the initial development of Houston.\\n\\nThe East End was a primary area for relocation for Germans, Italians and Mexican Americans that settled in areas near the port of Houston. Second Ward and Magnolia Park, located in the district, are two of Houston's oldest Hispanic neighborhoods. The Eastwood subdivision, established in 1913, is considered one of the first master-planned communities in Houston. The district has become popular who restore many of its vintage homes. In the mid-to-late 2000s upper middle class residents moved into the East End to take advantage of houses that are less expensive than west side houses. Many well-known Houstonians including Howard Hughes lived in Eastwood as children.Other neighborhoods include EaDo (East Downtown Houston), Broadmoor, Idylwood, Houston Country Club Estates, Forest Hill, Mason Park and Pecan Park.For several months leading into August 2007 the East End Chamber of Commerce Crime Awareness Committee argued that the Houston Police Department assigned insufficient police officers in the area.\\n\\nThe Talento Bilingue de Houston, the largest cultural arts center of its kind in Houston is located in the East End, as well as the 100 seat Carlos Garcia Theater at Houston Community College-Southeast campus which was dedicated in late 1997. The district is home to The Orange Show, Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, Mutalistan Hall, and a Chicano mural by artist Leo Tanguma on Canal Street.\\n\\nThe Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans opened the new $3.6 million AAMA Multi-Purpose Education Center in 1999. The center includes computer and science labs. The Ripley House-Neighborhood Centers successfully completed a capital campaign to raise $9 million to replace its 60-year old, aging physical structure with a new  community center.\\n\\nthumbThe Greater East End District is headquartered at 3211 Harrisburg Street.\\n\\nThe Houston Fire Department operates several fire stations in the East End. Three fire stations, Station 18 East End, Station 20 Magnolia Park, and Station 23 Lawndale are in Fire District 20. Station 17 Second Ward is in Fire District 8. In 1920 Station 2 was located in what would later become the East End. In 1926 the station moved to what would become Downtown Houston.\\n\\nHarris County Precinct Two operates the Raul C. Martinez/East End Courthouse annex in the East End. In addition the county operates Courthouse Annex 39 in the East End.\\n\\nthumbKBR maintained offices in a  campus on Clinton Drive, within the boundaries of the East End and the Fifth Ward. The KBR office complex is the former headquarters of Brown & Root. As of December 2010 KBR no longer operates this office.\\n\\nBy 2001 Halliburton owned the Clinton Drive campus. In August of that year Halliburton announced that it would consolidate 8,000 local employees to office space in Westchase. Halliburton planned to relocate around 2,000 employees from Clinton Drive and the industrial facilities would have been relocated to a location that was, in that month, undetermined. Sanford Criner, a principal at real estate brokerage Trione & Gordon, suggested that gentrification would turn what would have been the former Clinton Drive facility into entertainment, residential, or retail use, and that the facility would not have been redeveloped for office space usage. In December 2001 Halliburton canceled its plans to relocate employees to Westchase. Nancy Sarnoff of the Houston Business Journal said that it made more sense for the company to lease existing space instead of constructing new office space in times of economic downturns.\\n\\nIn 2010 KBR announced that it will vacate the Clinton Drive campus and move the 1,600 employees who work at the Clinton Drive office to the KBR offices in Downtown Houston. The company will then conduct an environmental cleanup of the Clinton Drive site.\\n\\nWhen Weingarten's existed, its headquarters was in what is now the East End.\\n\\nthumbResidents attend school in the Houston Independent School District.\\n\\nSections of areas within the East End Management District are zoned to the following schools:\\n\\nEastwood Academy is an HISD charter school serving the Austin High School attendance boundary.\\n\\nThe cafeteria of the former Anson Jones Elementary School became a reception hall.\\n\\nCharter school include:\\n\\nThe Houston Community College System serves the East End.\\n\\nthumbThree Houston Public Library locations are in the East End. They include the Patricio Flores Neighborhood Library, the Melcher Neighborhood Library, and the Stanaker Neighborhood Library.\\n\\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas operates transit bus services.\\n\\nIn addition as of 1997 several companies offered international bus services to Mexico from the East End. As of that year most of the passengers were Hispanics who were visiting family members. The international bus services from the East End were established in the 1990s.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "East Fife by-election, 1961", "body": "The East Fife by-election, 1961 was a by-election held for the British House of Commons constituency of East Fife in Scotland on 9 November 1961. It was won by the Conservative and National Liberal candidate Sir John E. Gilmour.\\n\\nThe seat had become vacant when the sitting National Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), Sir James Henderson-Stewart had died at the age of 63 on 3 September 1961. He had held the seat since a by-election in 1933.\\n\\nThe Conservative and National Liberal candidate was 49-year-old Sir John Gilmour, an Eton and Cambridge-educated baronet who was a local farmer and land-owner, and a decorated war-hero. His father, also called John, had been an MP for thirty years, serving as a minister in the 1920s and 30s including a period as Home Secretary. Gilmour was a reluctant by-election candidate; he had stood unsuccessfully at the 1945 general election in Clackmannan and Eastern Stirlingshire, but preferred local politics and had been a member of Fife County Council since 1955. However, he was pressured to stand by the constituency association which feared the imposition of an unpopular Conservative candidate.\\n\\nThe Labour Party candidate was John Smith, a 23-year-old law student at Glasgow University, who much later became leader of the party.\\n\\nThe Liberal Party candidate was Donald Leach.\\n\\nAfter a campaign notable for a large influx of students supporting the Labour candidate, Gilmour was elected with a reduced but still large majority, with nearly 50% of the votes. Labour narrowly pushed the Liberals into third place.\\n\\nGilmour was re-elected at the 1964 general election, with an increased majority over Smith, and held the seat until he stepped down at the 1979 general election.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "East Fremantle Football Club", "body": "East Fremantle Football Club is an Australian rules team in the West Australian Football League. The team's home ground is East Fremantle Oval and its colours are royal blue and white.\\n\\nThe East Fremantle Football Club was formed in 1898 and has won 29 league premierships in the West Australian Football League, making the club the most successful in Western Australia and the second most successful, to Port Adelaide, with 36 SANFL premierships, in Australia.\\n\\nEast Fremantle has a fierce rivalry with its Port cousin, South Fremantle, and the Foundation Day Derby between the two sides is a much anticipated highlight of the local football calendar. East Fremantle's success has thus far eclipsed that of South Fremantle, who (as of 2009) have won just 13 WAFL premierships.\\n\\nUp until 1987, Western Australia was immersed in WAFL culture and East Fremantle enjoyed a strong following. In 1987, a Perth-based franchise – the West Coast Eagles – joined an expanded Victorian Football League. West Coast's initial squad included many East Fremantle players and they were coached by former East Fremantle premiership player and coach, Ron Alexander.

{"title": "East Karelian Uprising and Soviet–Finnish conflict 1921–1922", "body": "The East Karelian Uprising (Finnish: itäkarjalaisten kansannousu) and the Soviet–Finnish conflict 1921–1922 were an attempt by a group of East Karelian separatists to gain independence from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. They were aided by a number of Finnish volunteers, starting from November 6, 1921. The conflict ended on March 21, 1922 with the Agreements between the governments of Soviet Russia and Finland about the measures of maintenance of the inviolability of the Soviet–Finnish border. The conflict is regarded in Finland as one of the heimosodat – \"Kinship Wars\".\\n\\nAfter Finland declared independence from Russia, a number of Finnish nationalists supported the idea of a Greater Finland attained through the annexation of Russian East Karelia. This was seen as an effort to form a unified country for Finnic tribes, who were regarded as kindred by these activists. The resulting two incursions by Finnish volunteers into Russia, called the Viena and Aunus expedition, are not considered wars against Russia in Finnish historiography. In Russia, this conflict, as well as the Finnish expeditions into East Karelia and the Kola Peninsula in 1918–1920, is considered a military intеrvention and called the First Soviet–Finnish War. This period of disagreement and uncertainty about borders was ended with the Treaty of Tartu, where Finland and the Baltic states first recognised the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as a sovereign state, and established the border between Finland and RSFSR.\\n\\nThe motivation for the uprising was East Karelians' year long experience of the Bolshevik regime – not respecting promises of autonomy, food shortages, the will of nationalistic kindred activists to amend the results of the \"shameful peace\" of Tartu, and the wish of exiled East Karelians. Finnish kindred activists, notably Jalmari Takkinen, the deputy of Bobi Sivén, the bailiff of Repola, had been conducting a campaign in the summer of 1921 in order to rouse the East Karelians to fight against the Bolshevik belligerents of the ongoing Russian Civil War. East Karelian paramilitary units called themselves Karjalan metsäsissit (English: Forest Guerrillas), and by autumn of 1921 a notable part of White Karelia was under their control.\\n\\nThe parishes of Repola and Porajärvi  of the Olonets Governorate had voted in favor of secession from Bolshevist Russia. In late 1919 the Russian White Army retreated towards the Finnish border to the Repola-Porajärvi area. The Finnish government led by Juho Vennola decided in February 1920 that Finland should intervene to help the dissidents by diplomatic means. Foreign minister Rudolf Holsti sent a message to his counterpart Georgy Chicherin stating that Finland would disarm the retreating Russian White troops if the Red Army does not occupy the parishes. Agreement was honoured by both parties, although there were minor skirmishes between Finnish troops and the Red Army. These fights led to armistice negotiations in Rajajoki, which ended unsuccessfully after two weeks.\\n\\nThere had been uprisings in White Karelia as early as 1920. After British forces left Karelia, Karelian ethnic nationalists arranged a meeting in Ukhta (now Kalevala, Russia) in March–April 1920 where they elected 117 representatives. In the meeting they decided that White Karelia should become an independent nation. Some parishes of Olonets Karelia joined in and the Väliaikainen toimikunta (Temporary Commission) renamed itself to Karjalan väliaikainen hallitus (Temporary Government of Karelia). However, the Red Army suppressed this uprising and in summer 1920 the Temporary Government fled to Finland. In its place, the Karelian Worker's Commune was formed, an autonomous oblast of the RSFSR.\\n\\nDuring the treaty negotiations, Finland proposed a referendum in East Karelia, through which its residents could choose whether they wanted to join Finland or Soviet Russia. Due to opposition from Russia, Finland had to withdraw the initiative. In return of ceding Repola and Porajärvi back to Russia, Finland acquired Petsamo and a promise of cultural autonomy for East Karelia. However this cultural autonomy was poorly carried out.\\n\\nFollowing the signing of the treaty, irredentists of the Repola county devised a contingency plan with the silent approval of the Finnish ministry of foreign affairs, titled Karhunpesäsuunnitelma (Project Bear's Den). They acquired a shipment of 500 Japanese rifles and 100 000 cartridges from Elmo Kaila, one of the Jäger Movement leaders. They also had two Maxim machine guns and four Lewis Gun. Weapons shipments for Project Bear's Den were an open secret and overlooked by Finnish customs officials.\\n\\nOn January 6, 1921 an aide of the Finnish minister of foreign affairs Rudolf Holsti demanded an official account for the weapons. Eventually, the leader of the Repola irredentists, Bobi Sivén, received a letter from the Finnish foreign ministry stating: \"Due to extraordinary circumstances you must do your utmost to prevent the people of Repola and Porajärvi from arming themselves.\" On January 12, Sivén committed suicide with his service pistol. In several suicide letters he left behind, he expressed his resentment at Finland \"betraying\" the East Karelians, and his wish to rather die for East Karelians than return to Finland. He had answered earlier requests from Finnish government to return to Finland by stating he resigns from his bailiff office, and prefers to live as a civilian in Repola. Due to succeeding events Sivén was elevated to a status of a minor Finnic national hero and martyr akin to Eugen Schauman, whose method of suicide he also imitated either on purpose or coincidentally, shooting himself in the heart instead of head in addition to the similar nationalistic pathos letters. Gradually these early uprisings and Finnish government's interest in supporting them dwindled.\\n\\nThe pivotal moment in the uprising was the council meeting of Karelian Forest Guerrillas in mid-October 1921. It voted in favor of secession from Soviet Russia. The key leadership was formed by military leaders Jalmari Takkinen, Finnish-born, aka. Ilmarinen, and Ossippa Borissainen. Particularly Vaseli Levonen aka. Ukki Väinämöinen, who had prominent Karelian features and general resemblance to the Finnish mythical character, was deemed suitable for his role as an ideological leader. Some 550 Finnish volunteers joined the uprising, acting mostly as officers and squad leaders. Most famous of them was Paavo Talvela and Erik Heinrichs of the Jäger Movement, who later served as high ranking staff officer in the Winter War and Continuation War.\\n\\nThe uprising is a peculiarity among heimosodat as this time the initiative was not taken by Finnish insurgents, but by East Karelian separatists, and Finnish government remaining officially passive. After the treaty of Tartu and Finnish government retreating from covert separatist support, the uprising was started by East Karelians, with Finnish volunteers joining afterwards. The uprising began with the immediate summary execution of anyone who was or was suspected to be a Bolshevik. The uprising escalated into a military engagement in October–November 1921. The 2 500 Forest Guerrillas were initially fairly successful, despite their lack of proper equipment.\\n\\nThe East Karelian rebels got some publicity in international media, but they had expected Finland to intervene with its defence forces. However, the Finnish government denied requests of arranging official enlistment, but it did not prevent private Finnish volunteer activists from crossing the border. Finland did agree to send humanitarian aid to the East Karelian rebels, taking the risk of provoking a war with the RSFSR. Russian historians, however, stipulate that the Finnish government did support the uprising in a military manner, and was intervening in an internal conflict.\\n\\nIn Northern White Karelia the smaller Vienan Rykmentti (Viena Regiment) was formed. Combined, the East Karelian rebels numbered 2 500.\\n\\nOn November 6, 1921 the Finnish and Karelian forces began a new incursion into East Karelia. According to Finnish historians, on that day Karelian guerrillas and Finnish volunteer forces attacked in Rukajärvi. Russian historian Alexander Shirokorad claims this force was 5 000–6 000 strong, which is twice the total strength of East Karelians and Finnish volunteers combined according to Finnish records.\\n\\nThe first Finnish volunteers reached Repola at the end of November, 1921. The volunteers acted as private citizens and were not considered a government intervention by Finland, but the Russian view differed. This controversy caused considerable friction in diplomatic relations between Finland and RSFSR. Most of the volunteers joined the Repolan Pataljoona (Repola Battalion). Command of the Battalion in Olonets Karelia was first taken by Gustaf Svinhufvud and thereafter by Talvela, at the middle of December 1921.\\n\\nBy the end of December 1921, the Finnish volunteers and Karelian Forest Guerrillas had advanced to the Kiestinki Suomussalmi – Rukajärvi – Paatene – Porajärvi lines. Meanwhile, the ca. 20 000 troops of the Red Army led by Alexander Sedyakin have reached Karelia and mounted a counterattack. The Red Army also had Red Finns within its ranks. These Finns had emigrated to Soviet Russia after their defeat in the Finnish Civil War. One such unit was a ski battalion of 200 Red military school cadets under the command of Toivo Antikainen.\\n\\nFinnish support of the uprising with volunteers and humanitarian aid caused a notable regression on Finnish-Russian diplomatic relations. Leon Trotsky, the commander of the Red Army, announced that he was ready to march towards Helsinki and Soviet Russian troops would strike the East Karelian rebels with a 20 000 strong army via the Murmansk railway.\\n\\nAt the onset of winter the resistance of Forest Guerrillas collapsed under superior numbers of the Red Army, famine, and freezing cold. The rebels panicked, and their troops started to retreat towards the Finnish border. According to Shirokorad, the troops of the Red Army had crushed the main group of the Finnish and Karelian troops by the beginning of January 1922 and had retaken Porajärvi and Repola. On January, 25 the northern group of the Soviet troops had occupied Kestenga and Kokkosalmi, and by the beginning of February occupied the settlement Ukhta.\\n\\nDuring the final stages of the uprising, the Red \"Pork mutiny\" occurred in Finland, sparking a hope among the rebels and Finnish volunteers that this would cause the Finnish government to intervene and provide military aid to the insurgents. This did not happen; on the contrary, the minister of interior, Heikki Ritavuori, tightened border control, closed the border preventing food and munitions shipments, and prohibited volunteers to cross over to join the uprising. The assassination of Ritavuori on February 12, 1922 by a Finnish nationalist activist did not change the situation.\\n\\nThe last unit of the uprising, remnants of Viena Regiment, fled Tiirovaara on February 16, 1922 at 10.45 am and reached the border at 1 pm.\\n\\nOn June 1, 1922 in Helsinki, Finland and Soviet Russia signed an Agreement between RSFSR and Finland about the measures providing the inviolability of the Soviet–Finnish border. Both parties agreed to reduce the number of border guards and to keep those who do not reside permanently in the border zone from freely crossing the border from either side to the other. Towards the end of the uprising some 30 000 East Karelian refugees evacuated to Finland.\\n\\nThe Karelian Worker's Commune was renamed into the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1923, and its autonomy was further expanded. However the cultural autonomy practically ended in 1933 - 1935 when Finnic leaders Edvard Gylling and Kustaa Rovio were set aside and teaching of Finnish language (used instead of Karelian as there was no written form of Karelian language at the time) was prohibited.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "East Retford (UK Parliament constituency)", "body": "East Retford was a parliamentary constituency in Nottinghamshire, which elected two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons for the first time in 1316, and continuously from 1572 until 1885, when the constituency was abolished. Although East Retford was technically a parliamentary borough for the whole of its existence, in 1830 its franchise had been widened and its boundaries had been extended to include the whole Wapentake of Bassetlaw as a remedy for corruption among the voters, and from that point onward it resembled a county constituency in most respects.\\n\\nEast Retford first sent members to Parliament in 1316, but thereafter the privilege lapsed until the borough was once more summoned to do so in 1572, probably at the instigation of the Earl of Rutland. Certainly, he considered himself entitled to influence its choice of members, and 1586 wrote to the borough asking for the nomination of one or both of the representatives; the borough authorities replied respectfully that \"Having considered the matter\" they felt themselves \"bound to satisfy you in that and any other much weightier thing. May it please you, therefore, to make choice and nominate and we will ratify it.\" However, they went on to note that they would be particularly happy to oblige if the Earl were to renominate the sitting member, Denzil Holles (who may well have been his nominee at the previous election), and since Rutland proved happy to do so, the proprieties were observed without any hardship. The Earls of Rutland retained their influence in Retford for several decades, often holding the municipal post of High Steward.\\n\\nThe borough consisted initially of the parish of East Retford, a market town which by 1830 had a population of around 2,500. By the end of the 17th century, the right to vote was restricted to the resident freemen of the town, but there was some dispute over who had a right to claim the freedom. (The House of Commons debated the borough's franchise seven times in a few years following 1700, coming to a different resolution each time, and never definitively settling all the details.) East Retford was not subject to the abuses common in many other freeman boroughs, where non-resident freemen could often vote and outnumbered the residents, but as elsewhere the town corporation was able to exert considerable control by deciding who to admit as freemen. In the second half of the 18th century, the qualified electorate amounted to about 150.\\n\\nHowever, the borough was no more independent than it had been in Elizabethan times, and by 1800 had been under the influence of the main local landowner, the Duke of Newcastle, for well over a century. Although it was not quite an entirely safe pocket borough, the Duke could generally be confident of seeing his chosen candidates returned. This influence was strongest in the second half of the 18th century when the borough was managed for the Duke by one of the sitting MPs, John White: there were no contested elections between 1741 and 1796. But even then it was necessary to work to maintain the Duke's popularity among the freemen, and after 1765 the then Duke (who had been Prime Minister until 1761) found his hold on Retford challenged by his nephew, the Earl of Lincoln. As Lincoln was also Newcastle's heir, it might have seemed that the dispute could not permanently weaken the family's control, but in the event the voters had been so stirred up that by the time Lincoln inherited the Dukedom in 1768 that they were unwilling to renounce their independence, and henceforth the Dukes of Newcastle could only count on one of the two seats. When the Corporation candidate was beaten by the Duke's two choices in 1796, the bailiffs and aldermen of the Corporation created 38 honorary freemen to ensure they had a majority once more at the next election; but the Court of King's Bench ruled the manoeuvre illegal (though it was common practice in many other boroughs).\\n\\nWith the election results in Retford no longer a foregone conclusion, it became worthwhile for candidates to take some pains to secure victory, and Retford's voters began to exploit the commercial value of their votes. The Newcastle influence became very limited while that of Earl Fitzwilliam waxed (though he himself and his Whig allies were apparently unconvinced of their own power), and the borough eventually became notorious for bribery. Retford's corruption took an unusual form: unlike the voters in most corrupt boroughs, the freemen tried to prevent contested elections, demanding instead that hopeful candidates should buy enough votes to secure a safe majority and avoid the need for a poll. At the elections of 1818 and 1820, the going tariff was 20 guineas for a vote, and the freemen (having two votes each) received 40 guineas for votes they never needed to cast. \\n\\nBut the stability of the system depended on the electors being able to reach a consensus over two candidates who could meet their demands, and a balance had developed whereby the Fitzwilliam interest chose one candidate and the leading members of the Corporation the other. Late in 1825, the prospective Corporation candidate for the next election withdrew through ill health, and Lord Fitzwilliam provocatively brought forward a second candidate of his own. The Corporation found another candidate, secured the support of the Tory Duke of Newcastle, and the election of 1826 was fought with no holds barred. Both sides bought up all the votes they could at the usual rate, and several pubs were kept open for months before the election, serving free beer from six in the morning until midnight. The Tory stood on a \"no popery\" platform, with his supporters openly boycotting tradesmen who opposed them, and election day ended in a riot. The two Fitzwilliam candidates won, but the loser petitioned against the result and the extent of East Retford's corruption was displayed to the world.\\n\\nParliament was united in being determined to find a remedy for East Retford's misbehaviour, but less clear as to what the most appropriate remedy would be. In the last years of the 18th century, several other boroughs found guilty of similar offences had been \"thrown into the hundred\" (had their boundaries extended to include the freeholders from the whole surrounding division of the county, so as to ensure that the corrupt townsmen could no longer sway the vote). But demands for a wider Parliamentary reform and a redistribution of seats to the more populous parts of the country were now widespread, and in the most recent corruption case (that of Grampound), the offending borough had been abolished altogether and its seats transferred elsewhere. \\n\\nThere were therefore vigorous debates as to whether Retford's franchise should not be transferred to one of the larger unrepresented towns such as Manchester or Birmingham. But both the Tory government and Whig opposition were split on the issue - the harder-line anti-Reform Tories did not want to set a precedent for establishing new boroughs, while many of the Whigs were reluctant to weaken the case for wholesale Reform by making piecemeal improvements. The Whigs were further embarrassed because a leading Whig had been implicated in vote-buying, and the Tories aware that throwing the borough into the hundred (or in Retford's case, the Wapentake) might well re-establish the lost influence of the Tory Duke of Newcastle over the constituency.\\n\\nThe people of Retford themselves were by no means unanimous in wanting to retain the franchise. During the House of Lords debates on the Disfranchisement Bill, it emerged that the town had an active committee, led by a couple of attorneys and meeting at the Turk's Head Inn, who were trying to make the borough seem even more corrupt than it was and ensure its extinction. One of its members was later seen wearing a handsome gold watch, apparently presented in gratitude by well-wishers in Birmingham!\\n\\nThe first compromise reached by the House of Commons was to put East Retford into the wapentake while transferring the seats of another guilty borough, Penryn, to Manchester, but the latter bill was defeated in the House of Lords. The question dragged on through the whole of the 1826-30 Parliament, and the Whig amendment to transfer Retford's seats to Birmingham was eventually defeated by 126 votes to 99. The Act that was passed in 1830 therefore reverted to the earlier practice, and the borough's boundaries were extended to encompass the Wapentake of Bassetlaw (which included the whole of the northern end of Nottinghamshire, including the town of Worksop): all those within this area who were qualified to vote in the county elections being also given votes for East Retford.\\n\\nIronically, this punishment saved East Retford's representation, in name at least. Within a year, Parliament was debating the Great Reform Bill, and the old borough's population was so small that it would have lost one of its seats. But the newly extended borough had a population of more than 37,000, and the Reform Act therefore left it untouched. It had 2,312 registered voters at the first reformed election, and around 7,500 after the second extension of the franchise in 1868. It retained its two members until 1885, when the constituency was replaced by an identically delineated single-member county constituency, Bassetlaw.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n"}

{"title": "East Texas Oil Field", "body": "The East Texas Oil Field is a large oil and gas field in east Texas. Covering  and parts of five counties, and having 30,340 historic and active oil wells, it is the largest oil field in the United States outside of Alaska, both in extent and in total volume of oil recovered since its discovery in 1930. It is a component of the Mid-Continent Oil Province, the huge region of petroleum deposits extending from Kansas to New Mexico to the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\nThe field includes parts of Gregg, western Rusk, southern Upshur, southeastern Smith, and northeastern Cherokee counties in the northeastern part of the state. Overall the field is about  long on the north-south axis, and five miles (8 km) across. Interstate 20 cuts across the field from east to west, and the towns of Kilgore, Overton, and Gladewater are on the field. At one time, downtown Kilgore had more than 1,000 active wells clustered in a tight area, making it the densest oil development in the world.\\n\\nThe primary productive geologic unit is the Cretaceous-age Woodbine Formation, a regional petroleum-bearing unit which had been known since the early part of the 20th century. This sandstone unit was deposited during a period when East Texas was a shallow sea, approximately 100 million years ago. During a subsequent period it was uplifted, eroded, and then covered again by the sea, which this time deposited a layer of impermeable chalk, creating a stratigraphic trap – a situation where oil, which is lighter than water and migrates upwards, reaches a point where it can move no farther, and pools. The source rock for the oil in East Texas is the lower-lying Eagle Ford Shale.\\n\\nWater intrusion from deeper in Woodbine Formation is the mechanism pushing oil through the reservoir toward the producing wells. A 1932 study showed that oil wells stopped flowing when water pressure dropped below 800 pounds per square inch.\\n\\nSeveral early attempts were made to produce oil in the area, beginning in 1911, with the failed Millville Oil Company, but drilling technology had not progressed sufficiently to reach oil at the depths at which it is found there, which are mainly below ; most early wells ended in broken bits, dry holes, and bankrupt operators. Finally, an enterprising Alabama man, Columbus Marion (Dad) Joiner, was the first with enough persistence to succeed, and on October 5, 1930, his Daisy Bradford No. 3 well (named after the widow who owned the farm) hit oil at  below ground surface. This well is located near the southeastern boundary of the oil field.\\n\\nShortly after the Daisy Bradford find, and after another two smaller wells were drilled near the original hole, another new well, this one on the Crim family farm about nine miles (14 km) north of the Bradford farm, reached oil, producing a gusher with a spectacular initial daily flow of . That the two wells were in a connected oil pool was not immediately obvious to those who drilled them; no field this large had ever been discovered. In January 1931, yet another group of investors and drillers put in a third important well about  north of the initial Daisy Bradford well; this one gushed  of oil per hour, from approximately the same depth as the other two wells – . Within a few months, drillers, landowners, and investors began to realize they had a spectacular oil field two-thirds of a mile under their feet, one which would produce enormous quantities of high-grade oil almost anywhere they drilled.\\n\\nIt was the enormous quantities of oil from the East Texas Oil Field, and their importance to the Allied effort in World War II, that led to the creation of the world's largest pipeline until that time, the \"Big Inch\", a ,  pipeline which transported crude to refineries in the Philadelphia area. Prior to building the pipeline, oil could only be transported by ship, and many such ships were sunk by German submarines during the early part of the war, especially in 1942 and early 1943. Construction of the pipeline commenced in August 1942, and on March 2, 1944 it was done. By the end of the war, over  of crude flowed from East Texas to the northeast states through the Big Inch.\\n\\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, the East Texas Oil Field was the center of a slant-hole scandal. Some unscrupulous operators had drilled slanted holes from across their lease lines into the productive portions of the Woodbine formation. Inspectors found 380 deviated wells and shut them down, with the assistance of the Texas Rangers. An estimated $100 million worth of oil was stolen over several decades from legal owners.\\n\\nSince its discovery, the East Texas Oil Field has produced more than  of oil, and originally contained more than .\\n\\n \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Easter Egger", "body": "thumbAn Easter Egger is any chicken that possesses the \"blue egg\" gene, but doesn't fully meet any breed description as defined in the American Poultry Association (APA) and/or the American Bantam Association (ABA) standards. The name derives from the resemblance of their colorful eggs to Easter eggs. Araucanas, Ameraucanas, and Easter Eggers are descended from the same founder stock that spread around the world from Chile and the Falklands. Three main founder breeds were involved in the creation of what we today call Araucanas, Ameraucanas, British tailed Araucanas, and the Easter Eggers. These would be the Quechua, the Quetro, and the Colloncas. In about 1976 some Chilean Araucanas were imported to the United States and are still here today unchanged. They appear except for color to be Ameraucanas or British tailed Araucanas. Some Easter Eggers breed true to type and color over fifty percent of the time. Molecular data retrieved from specimens of known provenance in the Falklands, United Kingdom, Shetland Isles, and Canada proved to be closely related. Consequently, the Ameraucana is probably closer genetically to the South American founders than the North American Araucana. None of these, Araucana, Ameraucana, or British tailed Araucanas were actually a breed in South America.\\n\\nOften confused with the rare, pure breeds of Araucana and the not so rare Ameraucana, the majority of chickens in laying flocks that lay blue or green eggs are Easter Eggers. Even if a bird meets an APA or ABA Standard of Perfection breed description, but doesn't meet a variety description, or breed true at least fifty percent of the time, it is technically considered an Easter Egger. These chickens also may exhibit the muffs and beards similar to the Araucana and Ameraucana.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution", "body": "The Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution is one of 14 state prisons in Oregon, United States. The prison is located in Pendleton, Oregon. The facility was originally built as a hospital for long-term mental patients, but was converted into a prison in 1983. In addition to providing confinement housing, food service, and medical care, the correctional facility offers education, vocational training, and work opportunities within the prison. Inmates at the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution produce Prison Blues garments, an internationally marketed clothing line. \\n\\nMost of the facilities that now house the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution were built in 1912 and 1913. They were originally built for use as a state mental hospital. As such, the buildings housed the Eastern Oregon Hospital and Training Center until the Oregon legislature authorized their conversion into a men’s medium-security prison in 1983. When the first inmates arrived at the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution on 24 June 1985, the prison became Oregon’s first state correctional facility located outside Marion County.\\n\\nToday, the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution is one of 14 state prisons run by the Oregon Department of Corrections. As of 2009, the prison was the fourth largest employer in Pendleton.\\n\\nThe Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution is a 1600-bed facility located in Pendleton, Oregon. It has 19 separate general population housing units with 596 dormitory beds and 897 confined cell beds. There is also a 99 bed single-occupancy disciplinary segregation unit and an 8 bed infirmary.\\n\\nMedical care is provided to all inmates as required. The medical services include sick call, ambulatory care, dental services, health education, and emergency care. There are also programs for control of communicable diseases, sex offender treatment, and treatment for alcoholism and drug abuse. The state prison’s Health Services Unit also conducts quality assurance and peer review of all medical services provided to inmates.\\n\\nThe prison provides behavioral health services including HIV education and counseling, mental health case management services, mental health day treatment, and crisis intervention counseling. Anger-management classes are available to inmates as well. The opportunity to participate in religious services is also provided. The faith-based programs help inmates make peace with their past and search for personal meaning in their life. These programs are all voluntary and available to all inmates.\\n\\nBlue Mountain Community College provides educational services at the prison. Between 1986 and 2009, approximately 1,000 inmates received either a General Educational Development certificate or a high school diploma through the institution’s basic educational program. In 1999, the prison expanded education opportunities through a program called the New Directions Education Project. The program offers inmates college level courses taught by instructors from Blue Mountain Community College. The cost of tuition, textbooks, and supplies are covered by donations from local churches, civic groups, foundations, and members of the public.\\n\\nThe prison’s creative arts program was begun in 2001. It includes wood working and cast iron work. The program provides meaningful work while inmates learn valuable job skills in a realistic work environment. This improves an inmate’s chance of getting a job and becoming a productive citizen upon release from prison. The creative arts program is self-financing, and has helped other state agencies develop similar wood working programs.\\n\\nEastern Oregon Correctional Institution’s commercial laundry cleans clothing and other items for the Snake River Correctional Institution as well as its own prison population. In addition, it provides laundry cleaning services to the Pendleton’s convention center, the city’s fire department, the local high school, and neighboring businesses. Other inmate work opportunities include the prison food service, clerical job, and facility maintenance.\\n\\nCommercial Prison Blues brand garments are produced at the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution. The garment manufacturing operation is one of the largest prison industries in the state. The Prison Blues enterprise manufactures denim blue jeans, yard coats, and work shirts for Oregon prison inmates and commercial sales to the public.\\n\\nThe Prison Blues production facility was established in 1989 by Inside Oregon Enterprises, a division of the Oregon Department of Corrections. The start-up cost for the  production facility was financed by a Federal grant, but the operation is now self-financing. By 1998, the Prison Blues brand was being sold in 30 states and overseas. In 2001, Prison Blues began marketing its denim jeans and other garments on-line. Today, the Prison Blues brand is a successful commercial product line sold across the United States and internationally.\\n\\nInmates who work in the Prison Blues factory are all volunteers. In fact, there is always a long waiting list of inmates who would like to join the Prison Blues workforce. To be eligible, an inmate must have a record of good conduct and successfully interview with the factory personnel office, an experience that helps inmates prepare for job interviews outside prison. Once hired, an inmate must continue to demonstrate good behavior and produce garments that meet the Prison Blues standard of quality. Inmates working in the Prison Blues factory are paid prevailing private sector wages. They are also eligible for quality and productivity bonuses. Part of their salary is returned to the state to help cover the cost of incarceration, pay victim restitution, and provide family support. Inmates also pay both state and Federal taxes on their earnings. The inmate can save the remaining amount or use it to provide additional family support, take college courses, or purchase items at the prison store.\\n\\nAt the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution, visiting is permitted five day a week, Wednesday through Sunday; there are two visiting periods each day.

The idea behind the proposal is to see a continuous route from South Arm to the Bowen Bridge without the need to travel via the Tasman Highway. The proposal would see Flagstaff Gully Road extended to the north to meet up with the East Derwent Highway. The idea was first investigated in 1995 when Ratio Consultants did a study on the proposed link. They considered four options for the link, the most popular choice would connect to the East Derwent Highway between Geilston Bay and Risdon Vale. Ratio concluded that constructing any of the options would most likely produce an unacceptable level of visual landscape, ecological, heritage and water quality impacts.In 2005 during the Clarence City Council elections, Alderman Doug Chipman lobbied the State and Federal governments for the construction of the proposed link road.Alderman Chipman also said at the time that while a Flagstaff Gully Link road may not be necessary right now, it probably will be in the next decade. Ald. Chipman suggested that planning should now be undertaken to ensure that when the road is needed, the government will have acquired the land, and informed anybody developing new properties in the area that the road will be built.In 2007 the Clarence City Council backed the proposal to extend the existing Flagstaff Gully Road. The council argued that, as this new road will be linking 2 state highways, it should be a state government responsibility. However, the state government saw it as a council issue.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eastern Towhee", "body": "The Eastern Towhee, Pipilo erythrophthalmus, is a large New World sparrow. The taxonomy of the towhee has been under debate in recent decades, and formerly this bird and the Spotted Towhee were considered a single species, the Rufous-sided Towhee.\\n\\nAdults have rufous sides, a white belly and a long dark tail with white edges. The eyes are red, white for birds in the southeast. Males have a dark head, upper body and tail; these parts are brown in the female.\\n\\nTheir breeding habitat is brushy areas across eastern North America. They nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs. Northern birds migrate to the southern United States. There has been one record of this species as a vagrant to western Europe; a single bird in Great Britain in 1966.\\n\\nThe call is Drink your teeeee; the word \"towhee\" imitates this call.\\n\\nThe eastern towhee occurs throughout the eastern United States. Occurrences from southern Saskatchewan and Quebec south to Florida, and west to eastern Texas are noted in a literature review. Populations north of southern New England through northern Indiana and Illinois to southern Iowa are primarily summer residents.\\n\\nPipilo e. erythrophthalmus occurs in the most northerly part of the eastern towhee's distribution in the summer, and migrates to the southern and eastern portion of the species' range in the winter. The other subspecies are largely residents . Pipilo e. canaster occurs from south-central Louisiana, north to northeastern Louisiana east through Mississippi, extreme southwestern Tennessee, northern Alabama and Georgia, central South Carolina to western North Carolina, and south to northwestern Florida and east along the Gulf Coast. The range of P. e. rileyi extends from northern Florida through southern Georgia and coastal South Carolina to east-central North Carolina. Pipilo e. alleni occurs in peninsular Florida .\\n\\nEastern towhee occurs in vegetation of disturbed areas, such as old-field successional vegetation and shrubby areas of power line right-of-ways. In northwestern Arkansas, eastern towhees occurred in old-field vegetation where dwarf sumac (Rhus copallina) occurred at a frequency of 28.6%, winged elm (Ulmus alata) at a frequency of 21%, and black cherry (Prunus serotina) at a frequency of 19.2% . Shrubby vegetation along power lines is commonly used by eastern towhees . For example in Maryland, eastern towhee territories along a power line right-of-way corresponded with shrubby areas containing species such as Allegheny blackberry (Rubus allegheniensis) and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). Other species included hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), black cherry, and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) .\\n\\nthumbArrival and departure of eastern towhees into summer breeding grounds varies with location. According a to literature review, eastern towhees typically arrive in New York in early April and leave by the middle of November. A review of eastern towhee in New Hampshire describes arrival in late April to May with the majority of eastern towhees departing in September . Further south, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, migration to high-elevation areas within the Great Smoky Mountains begins as early as March. Eastern towhees typically leave these sites in October . The Pipilo e. erythrophthalmus subspecies is the most migratory of the subspecies .\\n\\nBreeding begins in spring and continues to late summer. Reports of eastern towhees nesting as early as late March in Florida and Georgia, in mid- to late April in some midwestern states, and as late as mid-May in northern New England were summarized in a literature review . Literature reviews also report nest construction by the female, which takes about 3 to 5 days . Egg laying typically occurs until August. For example, a review of eastern towhee in Indiana notes nesting from 15 April to 20 August . However, a literature review of eastern towhee in Florida included a report of an eastern towhee nest observed on 2 September 1983 that contained 2 eggs . According to several literature reviews, eastern towhees may renest after failed nesting attempts and can raise 2, and in the south sometimes 3, broods per season .\\n\\nIn a literature review, Greenlaw  reports mean breeding territory size of 4 acres (1.6 ha) (range 1.6–6 acres (0.64–2.44 ha), n=24) in a mesic oak (Quercus spp.) forest where eastern towhees occurred at a density of 21 males/40 ha. In a xeric pine (Pinus spp.)-oak woodland where eastern towhee density was 32 males/40 ha, mean eastern towhee territory size was 3 acres (1.2 ha) (range 1.8–4 acres (0.71–1.65 ha), n=20) . In Massachusetts, mean male eastern towhee territory size was about 1.3 acres (0.52 ha), and female eastern towhee territory size was 1.1 acres (0.45 ha). Territory size changed over the course of the breeding season and was not significantly (p>0.05) affected by reductions in food availability of 30% or less. During the winter eastern towhees are not as territorial and may be seen in mixed species flocks . Daily movement of eastern towhees in loblolly (P. taeda) and longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests and clearcuts in South Carolina averaged 325 feet (99 m) per day. Only 2 females, out of 11 females and 9 males, stayed within the stand where they were captured for the duration of a 10-week study .\\n\\nEastern towhees have fairly strong fidelity to breeding territories. In an oak forest in New Jersey, adult eastern towhee return rates were 20% the 1st year after banding and 43% in subsequent years. Between 1960 and 1967, the maximum number of eastern towhee returns to the site was 5. In a Pennsylvania woodlot observed between 1962 and 1967, an eastern towhee returned to the site for 4 consecutive years .\\n\\nSeveral reviews report eastern towhee clutch sizes from 2 to 6 eggs, with means ranging from 2.45 to 3.6 eggs per nest . All 5 eastern towhee nests on Sanibel Island, Florida, contained 3 eggs . Eastern towhees in 2 pitch pine (P. rigida) barrens sites in New Jersey and New York had a later median egg laying date (mid-June) and significantly (p.\\n\\nA wide range of eastern towhee nest success values have been reported. On Sanibel Island, 1 of the 5 eastern towhee nests observed was successful. In Louisiana, average daily nest success rate was 95.3% on a bottomland hardwood forest site. The same study found a 92.6% average daily nest success rate in a 6-year-old managed cottonwood (Populus spp.) plantation in Alabama. Average eastern towhee nest success across mixed bigtooth (P. grandidentata) and quaking aspen (P. tremuloides) stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania was 48.1% . In South Carolina, only 1 of 10 nests was successful, and the mean daily nest survival rate was 62.9%. This low value was explained by high levels of predation. Due to lower nest success rates of Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) than the previous year, it is suggested that eastern towhee nest success may have been measured during a comparatively poor year .\\n\\nCompared to nests, adult towhee survival rates are high. Average weekly adult survival rate of eastern towhees in a South Carolina study area was 99.3%. This rate was obtained from radio-marked eastern towhees and represented the pooled survival of both sexes and from 2 South Carolina sites, young and mature stands of loblolly and longleaf pine . Between 1962 and 1967 in Pennsylvania, annual survival of breeding eastern towhees calculated from mistnetting recaptures was 58% . According to a literature review, both males and females become reproductively mature in their 2nd year . Eastern towhees of over 12 years old have been reported in the wild .\\n\\nEastern towhees range from near sea level to as high as 6,500 ft (1,980 m) along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina during the summer . A literature review reports eastern towhees up to 3,000 feet (900 m) in New Hampshire .\\n\\nEastern towhees spend the majority of their time near the ground. For instance, in Pennsylvania in spring, observations of eastern towhees below 3 feet (1 m) from the ground occurred significantly (p. In a Louisiana bottomland forest 62% of eastern towhee observations were within 2 feet (0.6 m) of the ground, and only 4% were observed above 25 feet (7.6 m). In the spring this changed, with detections of eastern towhees below 25 feet (7.6 m) declining from 70% to 65% and detections in the canopy (>25 ft (>7.6 m)) increasing from 4% to 7%.\\n\\nEastern towhees occur in many habitats, from tallgrass prairies and marshes to mature forests . However, eastern towhees are most common in early successional stands, habitat edges, and areas with similar vegetation structure throughout eastern forests.\\n\\nIn most communities eastern towhees are more abundant in young successional stands. Several studies found increased eastern towhee abundance on early successional sites compared to later-successional sites . Mean number of breeding eastern towhees (0.70 bird/50-m radius) and nest success rate (58%) were higher in a 15-year-old clearcut in West Virginia, than in other treatments, including a stand of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), black cherry, red maple, sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and white ash (Fraxinus americana) that was not harvested . In a southern Missouri oak-hickory forest, eastern towhees were not present before clearcutting or in the nearby uncut forest after cutting, but occurred at a mean density of 9.3 birds/10 ha in a 3-year-old clearcut. A study of stands of varying ages in central New York found that eastern towhee density peaked in early successional stands . \\n\\nAlthough eastern towhees generally prefer young successional sites, variation between habitat types and years has been observed. Krementz and Powell  found higher relative abundance of eastern towhee in young (2–6 years old) stands of loblolly and longleaf pine than mature (32–98 years old) stands when investigated in 1995. However, in stands compared in 1996, the 95% confidence intervals of eastern towhee relative abundance on the 2 sites had a substantial degree of overlap. The degree to which eastern towhee responds to succession is influenced by habitat. For example, in Pennsylvania there was a significant (p<0.05) difference between eastern towhee densities (number/10 ha) between mature mixed-oak forest and stands that had been clearcut about 5 years previously. However, eastern towhee densities did not differ significantly between a 1-year old mixed aspen (Populus tremuloides, P. grandidentata) clearcut, a 5-year old aspen clearcut, and a mature aspen stand . Eastern towhee abundance has been shown to peak at different times in different habitats. For instance, although in central hardwood forests eastern towhees were most abundant in regenerating stands, in loblolly and shortleaf pine forest they were most common in pole timber and mature stands. In addition, Bell and Whitmore concluded that early successional is likely too broad of a term for describing optimal towhee habitat, since high density of small trees was negatively associated with eastern towhee density in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.\\n\\nEastern towhees seem to prefer sites with characteristics generally associated with early successional vegetation, such as low canopy cover and dense understory. Negative correlations between eastern towhee abundance and various measurements of overstory density have been found in several studies . Average density of eastern towhees across 6 habitat types in Pennsylvania was significantly (p. Number of eastern towhees in a western Virginia hardwood forest was also significantly (p.\\n\\nMany studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between eastern towhee abundance and understory density. In a loblolly pine forest in South Carolina, understory (0–10 ft (0–3 m)) pine volume was significantly (p<0.001) positively correlated with the average number of eastern towhee territories per experimental unit . Yahner  found the average density of eastern towhees over 6 habitat types was significantly (p<0.05) positively correlated with density of short (2–5 foot (0.5–1.5 m)) shrubs. In east-central Florida slash pine (P. elliottii) flatwoods with understories dominated by myrtle oak (Q. myrtifolia) and sand live oak (Q. geminata) and in scrub sites with scattered slash pine and cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), eastern towhee densities were significantly (p=0.01) negatively correlated with mean shrub height .\\n\\nEastern towhees may associate with and avoid certain plants. In riparian vegetation in Iowa, eastern towhee density was significantly (p≤0.01) positively associated with total plant and vine species richness and negatively correlated with forb and deciduous tree species richness . In West Virginia, eastern towhees were associated with plant species that occurred on drier ridgetops, such as blackberry (p<0.02), black cherry (p<0.002), and black locust (p<0.04). These sites tended to have open canopies and low tree density. Eastern towhee density was negatively associated with plants of the moister parts of this study area, such as black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica, p<0.006), red maple (p<0.001), and witch hazel (p<0.03). In central New Jersey eastern towhees were significantly (p=0.03) more abundant in gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa) shrubland than either eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) or multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) shrublands .\\n\\nNesting habitat: Eastern towhees typically nest on or near the ground. Several literature reviews note the predominance of eastern towhee nests below 5 feet (1.5 m) . In a study of cowbird parasitism on Sanibel Island, all 5 eastern towhee nests located were within 6 feet (2 m) of the ground . Nests as high as 18 feet (5.5 m) have been reported in literature reviews . Nests higher off the ground in mixed aspen stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania had significantly (p.\\n\\nIn West Virginia, there were no significant (p>0.05) differences in habitat surrounding successful and unsuccessful nests. Large snags (≥9 inches diameter at breast height (≥22.9 cm)) did not have an effect on nesting success . Nesting success was not significantly (p>0.05) affected by stand age or distance to edge in even-aged mixed-aspen stands in Pennsylvania..\\n\\nEastern towhees nest in a variety of species including grape and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). The majority of nests observed in South Carolina loblolly and longleaf pine forests and clearcuts were located in grape, tree sparkleberry (V. arboreum), and oak (Quercus spp.) . On an oak-hickory site in West Virginia, 27% of 41 eastern towhee nests were found in grape, 17% in blackberry (Rubus spp.), 12% in greenbrier (Smilax spp.), and 12% in mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Nests also occurred in Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), spice bush (Lindera benzoin), and azalea (Rhododendron spp.) . In a power line right-of-way in Pennsylvania, the 6 eastern towhee nests observed occurred in Allegheny blackberry, witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), white oak (Q. alba), eastern hayscented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) and sweetfern (Comptonia peregrina) combined, and on ground level. According to literature reviews, eastern towhee nests located on the ground are embedded in litter in dry areas and typically occur at the base of grasses, forbs, low shrubs, or small trees .\\n\\nForaging habitat: Selection of forging habitat by eastern towhees has been investigated in Massachusetts and New Jersey. When gleaning in a southeastern Massachusetts pitch pine barren, eastern towhees preferred species such as pitch pine, bear oak (Q. ilicifolia), and other deciduous trees, mainly oaks. Ericaceous species were avoided. Use differed significantly (p. On 2 New Jersey sites, eastern towhee foraging preference switched over the course of the breeding season . On a site dominated by oaks, primarily black oak (Q. velutina), eastern towhees used oaks in May, as would be expected due to their density. However, in June and July, as relative arthropod biomass declined in oaks, use of oaks was less than would be expected. On a pitch pine-dominated site, use of oaks (primarily bear oak and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica)) was greater than would be expected in May, but was proportionate to availability in June and July. These negative correlations between date and oak use were significant (p<0.025) for both sites. Use of the oak-dominated site also decreased significantly (p<0.05) through the summer..\\n\\nEffects of spatial area: Eastern towhees appear to prefer edge habitats in many areas. For instance, the mean abundance of eastern towhees in a baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) in northern Florida was 18, while eastern towhees did not occur in either the baldcypress forest or the clearcut. At the interface of the baldcypress stand and a 13-year-old planted slash pine stand, mean abundance of eastern towhees was 22 breeding birds, while in the planted slash pine stand the average abundance was 15 breeding birds. Density of eastern towhees was found to decline with distance from the edge of a power line right-of-way and an oak-hickory forest in eastern Tennessee. At the edge eastern towhees occurred at a density of just over 10 pairs/40 ha, while 197 feet (60 m) from the edge eastern towhee density had dropped to 1 pair/40 ha. In addition, in experimentally clearcut Pennsylvanian forests composed of white oak, northern red oak (Q. rubra), chestnut oak (Q. prinus), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), red maple, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, and pitch pine, male towhees were detected significantly (p<0.05) more often than expected in the areas where the spatial arrangement of clearcuts was most patchy .\\n\\nSeveral studies have addressed the effect of the size of habitat patches on eastern towhees. In mixed-oak forest in New Jersey, eastern towhee frequency generally increased with patch size, although eastern towhees were detected in all plot sizes (0.5–59 acres (0.2–24 ha)) except 0.02–acre (0.01 ha) plots. On a site in South Carolina, eastern towhee frequency of occurrence increased as clearcut size increased from . Eastern towhees only bred in riparian vegetation patches in Iowa that were at least 650 feet (200 m) wide . In southern and eastern Pennsylvania eastern towhee nest success was not significantly (p≥0.10) different on sites with gradual edges and those with more distinct edges between \"wildlife habitat openings\" and oak-hickory forest .\\n\\nEastern towhees primarily eat on the ground, although they also glean from vegetation. In a southeastern Massachusetts pitch pine barren, 73.5% of male and 80.4% of female foraging observations were on the ground . When foraging on the ground eastern towhees use a scratching technique where both feet kick back simultaneously . In a laboratory study 4 eastern towhees used this method to successfully obtain seed buried almost 1 inch (2.25 cm) deep. When foraging above ground the majority of time is spent gleaning foliage . In Massachusetts, 22.5% of male and 16.3% of female foraging observations were of food being gleaned from foliage. Eastern towhees were also observed gleaning from twigs, branches, and trunks. When gleaning, eastern towhees occurred significantly (p<0.01) more often on the distal half of tree branches compared to using distal and proximal portions equally. In 0.5% of male and 0.3% of female foraging observations, eastern towhees hovered. Eastern towhees were never observed catching food out of the air .\\n\\nEastern towhees eat a variety of plant and animal matter. In literature reviews, eastern towhees are reported to eat seeds and fruits, several invertebrates, and occasionally small amphibians, snakes, and lizards . Reviews report eastern towhees foraging at feeders . Reviews show that animal matter makes up a larger proportion of the diet in the breeding season . In fall and winter, plants make up 79% and 85% of the diet, respectively. This drops to 53% in spring and 43% in summer . Insects such as beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera), ants, wasps, and bees (Hymenoptera), and moths and caterpillars (Lepidoptera) are common prey items. Eastern towhees eat other invertebrates such as spiders (Araneae), millipedes (Diplopoda), centipedes (Chilopoda), and snails (Gastropoda) to a lesser extent . Plants that comprise at least 5% of the eastern towhee diet include ragweed (Ambrosia spp.), oak, smartweed (Polygonum spp.), and corn (Zea mays) in the Northeast and blackberry, oak, panicgrass (Panicum spp.), ragweed, and wax-myrtle (Morella cerifera) in the Southeast .\\n\\nMany animals prey on eastern towhees and their eggs, including reptiles, mammals, and birds. A literature review summarizes several reports demonstrating that predators are a major cause of nest failure . The highest nest predation rate noted was 88% in a New York study. Mammals that are likely nest predators include northern raccoons (Procyon lotor), domestic cats (Felis catus), and eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus). Snakes such as bullsnakes (Pituophis catenifer), rat snakes (Elaphe spp.) and garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.) have been reported eating eastern towhee eggs. Weasels (Mustela spp.) and blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) are also likely nest predators . Several birds are known to prey on adult eastern towhees, including short-tailed (Buteo brachyurus), sharp-shinned (Accipiter striatus) and Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii). At least some mammals also feed on adult eastern towhees. In Maryland, an eastern towhee was found in the stomach contents of a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) .\\n\\nBrown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitize eastern towhee nests. In a South Carolina old field 5 of 19 eastern towhee nests were parasitized . Each parasitized nest contained 1 brown-headed cowbird egg. The desertion rate for parasitized nests was 20%, which was similar to nests that had not been parasitized (21%). Two of the five brown-headed cowbird eggs produced fledglings. The study did not determine if there was a difference in nest success between parasitized and nonparasitized nests . In West Virginia, only 3 of 41 eastern towhee nests were parasitized by the brown-headed cowbird. Average number of fledged young in nonparasitized nests was 2.8, which was similar to the average of 2.7 fledglings per parasitized nest . In a Pennsylvania study site, only 2 of 36 nests were parasitized and both produced eastern towhee fledglings . In a study of nest parasitism on Sanibel Island, none of 5 eastern towhee nests found were parasitized .\\n\\nTowhee, EasternTowhee, EasternTowhee, Eastern\\n\\n"}

The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) consists of three stages coordinating economic policy, achieving economic convergence (that is, their economic cycles are broadly in step) and culminating with the adoption of the euro, the EU's single currency. All member states of the European Union are expected to participate in the EMU. The Copenhagen criteria is the current set of conditions of entry for states wanting to join the EU. It contains the requirements that need to be fulfilled and the time framework within which this must be done in order for a country to join the monetary union. An important element of this is the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (\"ERM II\"), in which candidate currencies demonstrate economic convergence by maintaining limited deviation from their target rate against the euro.\\n\\nAll member states, except Denmark and the United Kingdom, have committed themselves by treaty to join EMU. Seventeen member states of the European Union have entered the third stage and have adopted the euro as their currency. Denmark, Latvia and Lithuania are the current participants in the exchange rate mechanism. Of the pre-2004 members, the United Kingdom and Sweden have not joined ERM II and Denmark remains in ERM without proceeding to the third stage. The five remaining (post-2004) states have yet to achieve sufficient convergence to participate. These eleven EU members continue to use their own currencies.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nFirst ideas of an economic and monetary union in Europe were raised well before establishing the European Communities. For example, already in the League of Nations,Gustav Stresemann asked in 1929 for a European currency (Link) against the background of an increased economic division due to a number of new nation states in Europe after WWI.\\n\\nA first attempt to create an economic and monetary union between the members of the European Communities goes back to an initiative by the European Commission in 1969, which set out the need for \"greater co-ordination of economic policies and monetary cooperation\" (Barre Report), which was followed by the decision of the Heads of State or Government at their summit meeting in The Hague in 1969 to draw up a plan by stages with a view to creating an economic and monetary union by the end of the 1970s.\\n\\nOn the basis of various previous proposals, an expert group chaired by Luxembourg’s Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Pierre Werner, presented in October 1970 the first commonly agreed blueprint to create an economic and monetary union in three stages (Werner plan). The project experienced serious setbacks from the crises arising from the non-convertibility of the US dollar into gold in August 1971 (i.e. the collapse of the Bretton Woods System) and from rising oil prices in 1972. An attempt to limit the fluctations of European currencies, using a snake in the tunnel, failed.\\n\\nThe debate on EMU was fully re-launched at the Hanover Summit in June 1988, when an ad hoc committee (Delors Committee) of the central bank governors of the twelve member states, chaired by the President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, was asked to propose a new timetable with clear, practical and realistic steps for creating an economic and monetary union. This way of working was derived from the Spaak method.\\n\\nThe Delors report of 1989 set out a plan to introduce the EMU in three stages and it included the creation of institutions like the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), which would become responsible for formulating and implementing monetary policy.\\n\\nThe three stages for the implementation of the EMU were the following:\\n\\nThere have been debates as to whether the Eurozone countries constitute an optimum currency area.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Economy of Benin", "body": "The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence agriculture and cotton. Cotton accounts for 40% of GDP and roughly 80% of official export receipts. There is also production of textile, palm products, and cocoa bean. Maize (corn), bean, rice, peanut, cashew, pineapple, cassava, yams, and other various tubers are grown for local subsistence. Benin began producing a modest quantity of offshore oil in October 1982. Production ceased in recent years but exploration of new sites is ongoing. A modest fishing fleet provides fish and shrimp for local subsistence and export to Europe. Formerly government-owned commercial activities are now privatized. A French brewer acquired the former state-run brewery. Smaller businesses are privately owned by Beninese citizens, but some firms are foreign owned, primarily French and Lebanese. The private commercial and agricultural sectors remain the principal contributors to growth.\\n\\nSince the transition to a democratic government in 1990, Benin has undergone an economic recovery. A large injection of external investment from both private and public sources has alleviated the economic difficulties of the early 1990s caused by global recession and persistently low commodity prices (although the latter continues to affect the economy). The manufacturing sector is confined to some light industry, which is mainly involved in processing primary products and the cow production of consumer goods. A planned joint hydroelectric project with neighboring Togo is intended to reduce Benin's dependence on imported energy mostly from Ghana, which currently accounts for a significant proportion of the country's imports. The service sector has grown quickly, stimulated by economic liberalization and fiscal reform, and the use of modern technology such as automobiles and computers has grown considerably as a result. Membership of the CFA Franc Zone offers reasonable currency stability as well as access to French economic support. Benin sells its products mainly to France and, in smaller quantities, to the Netherlands, Korea, Japan, and India. France is Benin's leading source for imports. Benin is also a member of the West Africa economic community ECOWAS.\\n\\nDespite its rapid growth, the economy of Benin still remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth in real output averaged a sound 5% since 1996, but a rapid population rise offset much of this growth on a per capita basis. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Commercial and transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are vulnerable to developments in Nigeria, particularly fuel shortages.\\n\\nAlthough trade unions in Benin represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the large informal economy has been noted by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of child labour, and the continuing issue of forced labour.\\n\\nBenin’s financial sector is dominated by banks, and in general remains shallow. However, a series of reforms were undertaken in the 1990s, which resulted in the consolidation of the banking sector and in the privatization of all state banks.\\n\\nA legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place and underwent significant reforms in 1999. There is no customer deposit insurance system.\\n\\nBenin has a lively and diversified microfinance sector. Data from 2003 by the Central Bank stated a penetration rate of microfinance services of almost 60 percent. In 2006 the Ministry of Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women counted 762 organizations with 1308 branches, including Cooperatives, NGOs, Savings/Credit Associations and government projects. Programmes for strengthening the sector are carried out on national and regional levels, such as the PRAFIDE (Programme Régional d’Appui à la finance Décentralisée). The microfinance sector is also subject to supervision through the Central Bank as well as the responsible Ministry for Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women.\\n\\nBenin is member of the regional Bourse Regional des Valeur Mobiliés (BRVM) located in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. Stocks were issued by a number of companies in the region. Listed bonds were partly issued by companies and partly by governments of the West African Monetary and Economic Union (UEMOA).\\n\\nThe payment and settlement system and clearing mechanisms were reformed in 2004 through the BCEAO and offer RTGS and SWIFT access to banks, financial institutions, the stock exchange as well as the Central bank and special banks.\\n\\nBeninBenin\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ed Wood", "body": "Edward Davis Wood, Jr. (October 10, 1924 – December 10, 1978), better known as Ed Wood, was an American screenwriter, director, producer, actor, author, and editor, who often performed many of these functions simultaneously. In the 1950s, Wood made a run of cheap and poorly produced genre films, now humorously celebrated for their technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, large amounts of ill-fitting stock footage, idiosyncratic dialogue, eccentric casts and outlandish plot elements, although his flair for showmanship gave his projects at least a modicum of critical success.\\n\\nWood's popularity waned soon after his biggest \"name\" star, Béla Lugosi, died. He was able to salvage a saleable feature from Lugosi's last moments on film, but his career declined thereafter. Toward the end of his life, Wood made pornographic movies and wrote pulp crime, horror, and sex novels. His posthumous fame began two years after his death, when he was awarded a Golden Turkey Award as Worst Director of All Time. The lack of conventional filmmaking ability in his work has earned Wood and his films a considerable cult following.\\n\\nFollowing the publication of Rudolph Grey's biography Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr. (1992), Wood's life and work have undergone a public rehabilitation of sorts, with new light shed on his evident zeal and honest love of movies and movie production. Tim Burton's biopic of the director's life, Ed Wood, earned two Academy Award.\\n\\nWood's father, Edward Sr., worked for the Postal Service and his family relocated numerous times around the United States. Eventually, they settled in Poughkeepsie, New York where Ed Wood, Jr. was born.\\n\\nDuring his childhood, Wood was interested in the performing arts and pulp fiction. He collected comics and pulp magazines, and adored movies, most notably Westerns and anything involving the occult. He would often skip school in favor of watching pictures at the local movie theater, where stills from the day's movie would often be thrown in the trash by theater staff, allowing Wood to salvage them to add to his extensive collection.\\n\\nIt is believed that Wood's mother, Lillian, always wanted a girl and would sometimes, until he was about 12 years old, dress her son in skirts and dresses. For the rest of his life, Wood was a heterosexual crossdresser. Wood received his first movie camera on his 12th birthday: a Kodak \"Cine Special.\" One of his first pieces of footage, and one that imbued him with pride, was the Hindenburg Zeppelin airship passing over the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, just minutes before its famous fiery demise at Lakehurst, New Jersey.\\n\\nOne of his first paid jobs was as a cinema usher, and he also sang and played drums in a band. He later fronted a singing quartet called Eddie Wood's Little Splinters, having learned to play a variety of string instruments. \\n\\nWood enlisted in the Marines at age 17, just months after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. He served from 1942–1946 and claimed that he had participated in the Battle of Guadalcanal while secretly wearing a brassiere and panties beneath his uniform.\\n\\nFascinated by the exotic and bizarre, Wood joined a carnival following his discharge from the Marines. His several missing teeth and disfigured leg (wounds suffered while in combat) combined with personal fetishes and acting skills made him a perfect candidate for the freak show. Wood played, among others, the geek and the bearded lady. As the bearded lady, he donned women's clothing and created his own prosthetic breast. Carnivals would be frequently depicted in Wood's works, most notably the semi-autobiographical novel Killer in Drag.\\n\\nWood's other habits included soft drugs, alcohol, and sex. He was a womanizer in his younger days, but in later life he was faithful to his girlfriends (most notably Dolores Fuller) and wife (Kathy O'Hara). Wood had one child, a daughter named Kathleen Emily Wood.\\n\\nWood's first wife, Norma McCarty, kicked him out of their house not long after they were married. McCarty had a son, Michael (\"Mac\"), from a relationship prior to Wood.\\n\\nFor a complete listing of films involving Ed Wood, see Ed Wood Jr. Filmography.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nWood's film career began after moving to Hollywood in 1947. He wrote scripts and directed television pilots, commercials, and several forgotten micro-budget westerns. Wood wrote, produced, directed, and starred in Casual Company, a play from his unpublished novel  which was based on his service in the United States Marine Corps. The play opened at the Village Playhouse in Hollywood to disastrous reviews on October 25, 1948.\\n\\nWood's big break came in 1953 when he was hired by producer George Weiss to make an exploitation film, I Changed My Sex, based on the life of transsexual Christine Jorgensen. After Jorgensen refused to collaborate on the film, Wood wrote a new autobiographical screenplay titled Glen or Glenda, a sincere and sympathetic study of transvestism. Wood directed and, using the alias Daniel Davis, played the titular character who has a fetish for cross-dressing and angora sweaters.\\n\\nAngora was regularly featured in his films. His wife Kathy O'Hara and others recall that Wood's transvestism was not a sexual inclination, but rather a neomaternal comfort derived mainly from angora fabric (Ann Gora also happened to be one of Wood's pen names). The medical experts in the film go to great lengths to stress that the transvestite is a perfectly normal heterosexual man who simply feels more comfortable and \"more himself\" when wearing women's apparel. There is even a fantasy vignette showing Glenda rebuffing the advances of a homosexual man. Even in his later years, Wood was not shy about going out in public dressed in drag as Shirley; his alter ego—female characters named Shirley also appear in many of his screenplays and stories.\\n\\nMost of Wood's films have a rushed quality due to the tight shooting schedule and limited budgets. While most directors film only one scene per day (or just a fraction of one in more contemporary pictures), Wood might complete up to 30 scenes. He seldom ordered a retake, even if the original was obviously flawed. Glen or Glenda, shot in just four days for $26,000, was done in a semi-documentary style. Narration and voice-over dialog was added to generous amounts of film-library stock footage (a cost-saving trick he used in his later films). The love-interest role of Barbara was played by Wood's real-life girlfriend, Dolores Fuller. She went on to appear in his next two films. Béla Lugosi, who was not told the film was about a transvestite, was paid $1,000 in cash for one day of filming. In a dark haunted-house set, speaking in vague, baffling metaphors and nursery rhymes, he played a portentous, omnipotent narrator.\\n\\nThe centerpiece of the film is a 15-minute fantasy sequence that illustrates Glen's tormented state of mind. Wood utilizes a barrage of surreal, dream-like vignettes with personalized symbolism. Producer George Weiss added to the confusion by inserting footage of flagellation and bondage, reminiscent of the fetish films of Irving Klaw, from another production. In this sequence, Barbara is pinned beneath a large tree (in her living room), and Glen rescues her; they are married with the Devil acting as best man; a shirtless man vigorously flogs a woman reclining on a couch; lewd burlesque dancers gyrate to blaring jazz music and tear at their clothes; a woman gagged and bound to a yoke-like pole is untied by another gagged woman; a lust-crazed man roughly assaults a seductress in a flimsy negligee; an enraged Glenda rips Barbara's blouse to shreds after she laughs at his appearance. Bela Lugosi appears in several scenes also rejecting Glenda and droning on repeatedly about \"snips and snails and puppy-dog tails\". The film was released under several regional titles such as Transvestite, I Led Two Lives, and He or She?.\\n\\nWood's next project was a proposed TV series called Dr. Acula, to star Lugosi as an investigator into the supernatural. When this fell through, he directed and produced the low-budget Jail Bait (1954), a 1930s-style gangster film with a twist ending à la The Twilight Zone. Originally called The Hidden Face, the title was inexplicably changed to Jail Bait, from an offhand reference in the script to an illegal hand gun. Wood also co-wrote the screenplay with writer-producer friend Alex Gordon. It was Gordon who introduced Wood to Béla Lugosi in 1952. (Gordon soon went on to help create American International Pictures). Lugosi was originally cast as the father of the lead character, but dropped out due to illness. Around this time, Wood became friends with a group of B-movie actors who became part of his entourage and stock company, appearing in most of his later films. These included Kenne Duncan, Lyle Talbot, Conrad Brooks, Duke Moore, Timothy Farrell, Swedish professional wrestler Tor Johnson, pin-up model and TV horror hostess Maila Nurmi (aka Vampira), the eccentric gay socialite Bunny Breckinridge, and the psychic Criswell.\\n\\nIn 1955, he produced and directed his first horror film, Bride of the Monster (originally titled Bride of the Atom). Although Wood took most of the writing credit, the original story, The Atomic Monster, was written by Alex Gordon. Wood contributed about half the dialogue, according to Gordon (in Starlog, November 1994). Béla Lugosi, in his last speaking role, stars as a mad scientist bent on creating an army of atomic supermen. The immense, 400-pound Tor Johnson plays Lobo, his lumbering henchman. Billy Benedict of The Bowery Boys has a walk-on role as a newspaper seller. The female lead, Loretta King, wears the same angora hat worn by Wood in Glen or Glenda.\\n\\nThe style and content of the film is highly reminiscent of the low-budget horror movies Lugosi made for Monogram Pictures in the 1940s, particularly The Corpse Vanishes. Wood's script even recreates a laboratory scene from that film (Lugosi's mad scientist flogging his henchman) with the same fake, painted stone wall backdrop. Budget-saving film library footage of lightning, explosions, a nuclear blast, and a giant \"atomic\" octopus was also inserted. In one scene the hero, trapped in quicksand, is menaced by an obvious stock footage alligator. In the finale, the frail, elderly Lugosi was reduced to thrashing about in the mud with a large rubber octopus when the motor needed to turn it into a flailing beast could not be located. Allegedly, the octopus's motor was left behind when Wood and the crew stole the octopus from a Warner Bros. prop warehouse.\\n\\nWood, in 1956, planned to follow Bride of the Monster with The Ghoul Goes West (a.k.a. The Phantom Ghoul), which would have been a combination of his two favorite genres: Horror and Westerns. The story was mainly a rehash of Bride of the Monster in a western setting (a synopsis of the screenplay was published in Filmfax  no. 18, December/January 1989-90). Lugosi, recently out of rehab for morphine addiction, was to star as the undertaker/mad scientist. Gene Autry and Lon Chaney, Jr. were also attached to the project for a time. Wood could only raise enough money to shoot one day's worth of silent test footage. A few random scenes were filmed of Lugosi at a funeral, in front of Tor Johnson's house, and stalking about in his Dracula costume (possibly intended for The Vampire's Tomb, another unrealized film). The scenes were filmed to show to prospective financial backers. Lugosi died soon afterward on August 16 and the footage became the seed for Wood's next project.\\n\\nPlan 9 from Outer Space incorporated the final Lugosi scenes into a new story that combined horror and science fiction. Wood's chiropractor, his face hidden behind a cape, doubled for Lugosi in several scenes. Tor Johnson and wasp-waisted Vampira (Maila Nurmi) are memorable, even iconic, as zombies risen from the grave by alien invaders. The film was shot over a five-day period in November 1956 on a budget of around $20,000. All of Nurmi's scenes were filmed in just two hours (she was paid the union minimum wage of $200). Resorting again to the \"docu-fantasy\" approach, Criswell, the flamboyantly inaccurate TV psychic, acts as on-screen host and narrator. He cryptically describes the story as \"something more than a fact\". Cost-free stock footage of airliners, explosions, and fighter jets were edited in. The flying saucer (made from plastic toy store models) are fired upon by an artillery barrage taken from World War II newsreels. Although completed in 1956, the film was not released until 1959, due to the inability of the producer to secure distribution.\\n\\nMost notably, for Plan 9, he convinced members of churches of the Southern Baptist Convention (through his landlord at the time) to invest the initial capital, allegedly convincing them that a successful science fiction picture would make enough money to fund their own pet project of 12 movies about the 12 Apostles. They reportedly changed the name of the movie from Grave Robbers from Outer Space and removed lines from the script which they considered profane; one source alleges they required the actors to accept their church's baptism as part of the deal. The grave-diggers in the picture are the two primary backers. Wood's frequently being overruled by producers and financiers was one factor contributing to his depression and was something he personally blamed for his lack of commercial success.\\n\\nAlso in 1956, Wood's Teenage Girl Gang script was produced as The Violent Years, an exploitation film about a gang of juvenile delinquent high school girls. Directed by William M. Morgan, it starred first-time actress Jean Moorhead, a former Playboy Miss October 1955 centerfold model. The film is notable for its unusual girls-gone-bad premise and risqué abduction scene where a girl is bound and gagged with strips of her shredded dress while her boyfriend is sexually assaulted (off camera) by the lusty girl gang. This foreshadows Wood's fearless, anything-goes attitude seen in his later, racier novels and films.\\n\\nIn 1958, Wood's screenplay Queen of the Gorillas was released as The Bride and the Beast, a fantasy tale about a gorilla reincarnated in the body of a beautiful woman. That same year Wood wrote, produced, and directed Night of the Ghouls (original title: Revenge of the Dead), an \"old dark house\" tale about a fake medium and evil spirits. The setting is the rebuilt house on Willows Lake that burned down in Bride of the Monster. There are frequent references to the mad scientist (Lugosi) and monster from the previous film, and Tor Johnson reprises his Lobo role, his face now half-destroyed from the fire. Paul Marco makes his third appearance as Kelton, the cowardly, inept policeman. Criswell, billed as himself, returns as host and narrator, rising from his coffin to introduce this tale of \"Monsters to be pitied. Monsters to be despised!\" (Tim Burton's Ed Wood biopic opens with a faithful recreation of this scene). Criswell also plays a character role as one of the vengeful ghosts seen at the climax of the film.\\n\\nIn one of the early scenes, a girl (wearing an angora sweater) and her boyfriend are attacked by the Black Ghost. Wood, his face hidden by a dark veil, doubles for the female ghoul in several shots. A fight scene from the unfinished Hellborn was edited in (more scenes from that project appeared in ''The Sinister Urge''). Most of Lieutenant Bradford's exploration of Dr. Acula's house was lifted from Wood's short film Final Curtain and given a voice-over by Criswell to integrate it into the current story. A publicity photo of Wood is seen on a wanted poster on the wall of the police station. The finale, with the ghouls reduced to skeletons and Criswell's epilogue, were used again in 1965 for Orgy of the Dead. For decades this remained a lost film that was never released to theaters. Wood lacked the funds to pay the film processing fees, so it languished in limbo until it was finally released on video in 1983.\\n\\nIn 1961, Wood worked on the script for another potboiler, Married Too Young, and wrote and directed The Sinister Urge from his Racket Queen script. This lurid exposé on the \"smut picture racket\" purports to warn against the dangers of pornography. The story concerns a police man hunt for a sex maniac psycho-killer. The police are played by Wood regulars Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore, and Carl Anthony. Filmed in five days in 1960, this is the last mainstream film that Wood directed. Ironically, his career would soon spiral downward into a blur of \"smut racket\" nudie flicks, softcore pornography, and end with X-rated novels and films.\\n\\nIn 1963, he wrote the screenplay for Shotgun Wedding, an exploitation film about hillbillies marrying child brides. Wood's transitional film, once again combining two genres, horror and grindhouse skin-flick, was Orgy of the Dead (1965). Wood wrote the screenplay, originally called Nudie Ghoulies, and handled various production details while Stephen C. Apostolof directed under the pseudonym A.C. Stephen. The film begins with a re-creation of the opening scene from the then unreleased Night of the Ghouls. Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi's old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, The Black Ghoul (a Vampira lookalike) preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation flicks up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays and occasionally acted.\\n\\nHis remaining output until his death in 1978 was confined to writing lurid crime and sex novels, often featuring girl gangs and transvestites, and a dozen obscure, low-budget adult films, some with an occult theme. Titles include: The Photographer (1969), Take It Out in Trade (1970), The Only House in Town (1970), with Uschi Digard, Necromania (1971), The Undergraduate (1972), and Fugitive Girls (1974). As told in Nightmare of Ecstasy, Maila Nurmi declined Wood's offer to do a nude scene sitting up in a coffin for Necromania.\\n\\nOne of Wood's heroes was Orson Welles for his cinematic ambition and passion. Wood also prided himself on the fact that he was the only filmmaker of his era other than Welles to be writer, director, and actor in his own films, although it is likely that Wood took on all of these functions to save time and money. Unlike the depiction in the Tim Burton movie Ed Wood, Wood never actually met his hero Welles.\\n\\nBéla Lugosi Jr. has been among those who felt Wood exploited the senior Lugosi's stardom, taking advantage of the fading actor when he could not refuse any work. Most documents and interviews with other Wood associates in Nightmare of Ecstasy suggest that Wood and Lugosi were genuine friends and that Wood helped Lugosi through the worst days of his depression and addiction.\\n\\nWood's 1972 film The Undergraduate is considered lost along with his 1970 film Take It Out In Trade, which exists only in outtake without sound (released by Something Weird Video). Wood's 1971 film Necromania was believed lost for years until an edited version resurfaced at a yard sale in 1992, followed by a complete unedited print in 2001. A complete print of the previously lost Wood pornographic film The Young Marrieds was discovered in 2004.\\n\\nBeginning in the early 1960s, Wood supplemented his directing and screenwriting income with hastily written pulp fiction, including innumerable pulp crime, horror, and sex novels and occasional non-fiction pieces. As he became increasingly unable to fund film projects, the novels seem to have become Wood's primary source of income.\\n\\nWood's novels frequently include transvestite or drag queen characters, or entire plots centering around transvestism (including his angora fetish), and tap into his love of crime fiction and the occult. Wood would often recycle plots of his films for novels, write novelization of his own screenplays, or reuse elements from his novels in scripts. His first novel, Black Lace Drag was published in 1963 and reissued in 1965 as Killer in Drag. Among his other books are Orgy of The Dead (1965), Devil Girls (1967), Death of a Transvestite (1967), The Sexecutives (1968) and A Study of Fetishes and Fantasies (1973).\\n\\nFrom 1963 until his death in December 1978, Wood wrote at least 80 novels in addition to hundreds of short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines.\\n\\nIn a December 2010 published article at [[Mondo Film &amp; Video Guide]], indie print publisher Feral House, who in the last few years had re-printed dozens of Wood's novels, ended sales on all Wood titles. Feral House informed the online film magazine, that the estate of Ed Wood had requested a cease and desist, due to a lack of knowledge on the fact, that Wood may or may not have actually written all the novels that some claim he had.\\n\\nDescriptions of Wood's working methods in Nightmare of Ecstasy indicate he would work on a dozen projects at once, simultaneously watching television, eating, drinking, and carrying on conversation while typing. In his quasi-memoir, Hollywood Rat Race, Wood advises new writers to \"just keep on writing. Even if your story gets worse, you'll get better\". But mostly the book concerns the pitfalls of Hollywood, and has some advice from Ed Wood Jr., for anyone who is setting their sights on making it in Hollywood. Wood does not candy coat the experience that a first timer in Hollywood will shockingly discover. He also devotes time in Hollywood Rat Race to making the reader wary of beauty pageant and modelling scams and con games, both in Hollywood and the world over.\\n\\nAs Wood's most famous films of the 1950s are not explicitly sexual or violent, the outré content of his novels may shock the unprepared reader. Wood's dark side emerges in such sexual shockers as Raped in the Grass or The Perverts and in short stories such as Toni: Black Tigress, which exploit hot-button topics such as violence, rape, racial issues, juvenile delinquency and drug culture.\\n\\nSome of Wood's books remained unpublished during his lifetime. Hollywood Rat Race, for example, was written in the 1960s, and finished in 1965, but was not finally published until 1998. The non-fiction book is part primer for young actors and filmmakers, and part memoir. In Hollywood Rat Race, Wood recounts tale of dubious authenticity, such as how he and Béla Lugosi entered the world of nightclub cabaret.\\n\\nWood had serious financial difficulties in his final years, often producing full movie scripts for as little as $100 in order to make ends meet. His career as a director had degenerated into making pornographic films such as Necromania (1971) and Take It Out in Trade, a softcore take on the Philip Marlowe detective films. Wood also made occasional appearances as an actor, appearing in two films produced by a Marine buddy, Joseph F. Robertson. Love Feast (1969), also known as Pretty Models All in a Row, was his first lead role in a film since 1953's Glen or Glenda, as a photographer using his position to engage in sexual antics with professional models. He had a smaller role in Robertson's ode to swinger parties, Mrs. Stone's Thing. Wood appeared as a transvestite who spends his time at a party trying on lingerie in a bedroom. In Rudolph Grey's Nightmare of Ecstasy, Robertson makes a reference to Wood reappearing in a film called Misty, of which no other record remains.\\n\\nHis primary film work in the 1970s was working with friend Stephen C. Apostolof, usually cowriting scripts, but also serving as an assistant director and associate producer. His last known on-screen appearance was in Apostolof's Fugitive Girls (aka Five Loose Women), where he played a dual cameo as a gas station attendant called Pops and as the sheriff on the women's trail.\\n\\nWood's depression worsened, and with it a serious drinking problem. Evicted from his Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street, Wood and his wife moved into the North Hollywood apartment of friend Peter Coe. On December 10, 1978, only days after the move, the 54-year old Edward D. Wood died of a heart attack while watching a football game alone in Coe's bedroom. In Nightmare of Ecstasy, it was reported Wood yelled out \"Kathy, I can't breathe!\", a plea his wife in the living room ignored for 90 minutes before finally going in to find him dead; apparently, he frequently feigned heart attacks and screamed for help as a way of teasing her, and at one point she even shouted at him to shut up. When he passed, Kathy herself publicly said \"The world has lost a great writer.\"\\n\\nWood was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea. Edward Wood Jr's wife Kathy died on June 26, 2006, having never remarried.\\n\\nAmong connoisseur of kitsch and bad cinema, Edward Wood Jr. is revered as one of the ultimate bad directors of all time for a variety of reasons. His cult status began two years after his death with his recognition in the Michael and Harry Medved book The Golden Turkey Awards, and has continued with the rediscovery of many of his long-lost works. In an essay paying homage to Wood in Incredibly Strange Films, Jim Morton writes: \"Eccentric and individualistic, Edward D Wood Jr was a man born to film. Lesser men, if forced to make movies under the conditions Wood faced, would have thrown up their hands in defeat.\"\\n\\nThe University of Southern California holds an annual Ed Wood Film Festival, in which students of all disciplines are challenged to form teams to write, film and edit an Ed Wood-inspired short film based on a preassigned theme. Past themes have included Slippery When Wet (2006), What's That in Your Pocket? (2005), and Rebel Without a Bra (2004). 2007 saw a break in this tradition when the theme My eyes are killing me was accompanied by a theme object: a mirror.\\n\\nSome of Wood's most famous films, including Glen or Glenda and Plan 9 from Outer Space have been remade as pornographic movies (as Glen & Glenda and Plan 69 from Outer Space, respectively). They were not simply spoofed or referenced, but reshot, with the same or similar script, and sex scene worked into the original plots.\\n\\nIn 1998, Wood's previously unfilmed script I Woke Up Early The Day I Died was finally produced, starring Billy Zane and Christina Ricci, and has preserved the inept, goofy character that made Wood's films famous. Outside of a brief New York theatrical engagement, the film did not receive a commercial release in the United States, and was only available on video in Germany due to contractual difficulties.\\n\\nThree of his films (Bride of the Monster, The Violent Years, and The Sinister Urge) have been featured on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000, which has given those works wider exposure. Producers considered including Plan 9, but found it had too much dialogue for the show's format. Series head writer and host Michael J. Nelson would go on to do an audio commentary for a 2005/2006 DVD release of the film, which was newly colorized.\\n\\nReverend Steve Galindo of Sacramento, California, created a legally recognized religion in 1996 with Wood as its official savior. Originally founded as a joke, the Church of Ed Wood now boasts over 3,500 baptized followers. Woodites, as Steve's followers are called, celebrate Woodmas on October 10, which is Ed's birthday. Numerous parties and concerts are held worldwide to celebrate Woodmas. On October 4/5, 2003, horror host Mr. Lobo was canonized as the \"Patron Saint of late night movie hosts and insomniacs\" in the Church of Ed Wood.\\n\\nThe cult status of Ed Wood's movies is also represented in the music industry. Horror film director and heavy metal musician Rob Zombie titled his 2001 album The Sinister Urge after Wood's film.\\n\\nThe 1994 film Ed Wood, by director Tim Burton, tells the story of Wood and Lugosi and the making of their three films, (Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and Plan 9 from Outer Space), from a sympathetic point of view. Wood was played by Johnny Depp and Lugosi by Martin Landau, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film also won an Academy Award for Best Makeup for Rick Baker. Burton's successes for previous studios such as Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox were at odds with his insistence on shooting the Wood film in black-and-white, and the studios turned it down as a probable box office failure. Eager to embrace Burton, Disney accepted the project, monochrome and all. As others had anticipated, the film received mass critical acclaim, but did poorly at the box office. It has since become a cult classic.\\n\\n"}

He was a popular man in Wayanad and it was due to his work that Wayanadians of all classes supported Pazhassi Raja's war-effort.\\n\\nKunkan became famous with his capture of Panamaram fort in October 11 of 1802.What followed this exploit was a great revolt all over Wayanad against British rule. Shortly afterwards, Kunkan went to Pulpally pagoda from where he made an appeal to all Wayandians to join rebel ranks-Response was overwhelming-3000 men volunteered and from then onwards till early 1804, Pazhassi rebels launched constant attacks over British positions throughout Northern Malabar, reaching as far as coastal towns of Kannur, Talassery and Calicut.\\n\\nKunkan made two attempts in open confrontation with British-in 1802 at Wayanad where he tried to block a British army en route to Mananthavadi and in 1803 tried to besiege an outpost at Pazhassi. Both ended in failures but he learnt from them and the onwards he concentrated on guerrilla warfare only and score large successes.

{"title": "Eddie Cicotte", "body": "Edward Victor Cicotte (; June 19, 1884 – May 5, 1969), nicknamed \"Knuckles\", was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball best known for his time with the Chicago White Sox. He was one of eight players permanently ineligible for professional baseball for his alleged participation in the Black Sox scandal in the 1919 World Series, in which the favored White Sox lost to the Cincinnati Reds in eight games.\\n\\nCicotte was the son of Ambrose Cicotte (1843–1894) and Archange Mary Drouillard (1843–1909), both of mainly French-Canadian extraction. His father's early death is said to have pushed Cicotte to excel and be very protective of his family. He married Rose Ellen Freer (1885–1958), daughter of Russell John Freer (1852–1932) and Annie Cecile Thornton (1863–1928), both of whom would later live with the Cicottes. They had two daughters, Rose (born 1906) and Virginia (1916–1992), and one son, Edward Jr. (1919–1992).\\n\\nCicotte was a starting pitcher and a knuckleball specialist who won 208 games and lost 149 over the course of a 14-year career pitching for the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, and White Sox. At the time of his lifetime ban, he was considered one of the premier pitchers in the American League.\\n\\nA Detroit native, Cicotte played baseball in Georgia in 1905, where he was a teammate of Ty Cobb. Both players were purchased by the Tigers, and Cicotte made his big-league debut on September 3, 1905. Pitching in three games for Detroit, Cicotte compiled a 1-1 record with a 3.50 ERA.\\n\\nCicotte didn't return to the major leagues again until 1908, when he resurfaced with the Red Sox. After he compiled a 41-48 record in a Boston uniform, the Red Sox sold him to the White Sox on July 22, 1912.\\n\\nCicotte celebrated a breakout year in 1913, going 18-12 on the season with an ERA of 1.58. He went on to lead the league in winning percentage in 1916. But his best year was 1917, when he won 28 games and led the league in wins, ERA, and innings pitched. On April 14 he threw a no hitter against the St. Louis Browns. That year, the White Sox went to the World Series, defeating the New York Giants 4 games to 2. Cicotte won Game 1, lost Game 3, and pitched six innings of relief in Game 5 for a no-decision.\\n\\nInjuries reduced Cicotte to a 12-19 record in 1918, but in 1919, he rebounded to win 29 games and once again lead the league in wins, winning percentage, and innings pitched, as well as in complete game. His 1919 salary was $6,000, but he had a provision for a $10,000 bonus if he won 30 games. Legend has it that as the season drew to a close, owner Charles Comiskey ordered manager Kid Gleason to bench Cicotte, denying him a chance at a 30-win season and the bonus money. Some have speculated this was his motivation for participating in the fix, although the facts do not appear to support this conclusion. (See Black Sox scandal.)\\n\\nHowever, the book Eight Men Out by Eliot Asinof and the movie based on the book does record that Cicotte, despite being grossly underpaid for a pitcher of his ability, resisted repeated attempts by Chick Gandil to get him to throw the series until just days before the World Series opened when it became clear that Comiskey would never pay him even part of the promised bonus. The fact that the offer price for the fix exactly matched the promised bonus, lends credibility to this version of events. \\n\\nIn the 1919 World Series against the Reds, Cicotte pitched in three games, winning one but pitching ineffectively and losing the other two.\\n\\nCicotte was the first of the eight players to come forward, signing a confession and a waiver of immunity. He later recanted this confession and was acquitted of all charges at trial by jury. Despite this, Cicotte and his alleged co-conspirators were subsequently made permanently ineligible for baseball by Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Major League Baseball's new commissioner, recently hired to restore the integrity of the game in the wake of the 1919 scandal.\\n\\nHis baseball career over, Cicotte returned to Livonia MI., where he worked for the Ford Motor Company and other miscellaneous jobs, including a berry farmer, until his death in Livonia at age 84. He also served as a Game Warden in the Michigan Department of Wildlife Resources.\\n\\nIn the 1988 film Eight Men Out, about the Black Sox scandal, Cicotte is portrayed by actor David Strathairn.\\n\\nPortrayed by actor Steve Eastin in the 1989 film Field of Dreams.\\n\\nCicotte's grandnephew Al Cicotte (1929–1982) would later pitch in the major leagues, compiling a lifetime 10-13 record with six different teams, 1957-1962.\\n\\n"}

Myers, Florida), is a former professional baseball player who played second base and outfield from 1923-1934 in the Major Leagues.\\n\\nMoore nearly usurped Pie Traynor's job as the starting third baseman for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1924, his rookie season. Traynor, mired in a terrible slump, was benched on June 18, and Moore batted .423 in his first 13 games at the position. On the strength of this performance, manager Bill McKechnie declared Moore to be his starter going forward. However, Moore was hit by a pitch from Johnny Stuart of the St. Louis Cardinals on July 1, suffering a dislocated shoulder, and Traynor took advantage of Moore's absence to re-solidify his hold on the position.\\n\\nThe next season, after Rabbit Maranville was traded to the Chicago Cubs, Moore became the Pirates' starting second baseman. He injured his shoulder on May 8, but was forced back into the lineup at less than full strength after only a few days of rest because the father of his backup, Johnny Rutledge, had died unexpectedly.\\n\\nMoore was sold to the Boston Braves in 1926, after a confrontation with Fred Clarke, who was then working as the Pirates' assistant manager and head of scouting. The trouble began during a doubleheader against the New York Giants on July 12. Moore committed an error in the first game, and was booed by the crowd. He had a habit of reflexively smiling during moments of stress, and when Clarke saw his grin, he took it to be a sign that Moore did not care about what he was doing. The two got into a shouting match in the dugout after the end of the inning, with Moore telling Clarke to \"get off the bench\". That game was Moore's last with the Pirates. That evening, McKechnie fined Moore and pitcher Emil Yde for what he termed \"indifferent play\", and on July 20 the team sold Moore to the Braves.\\n\\nMoore helped lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a Southern Association championship in 1933, batting .309 as the team's starting shortstop.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eddie Prévost", "body": "thumbEdwin Prévost (born June 22, 1942 in Hitchin) is an English drummer and percussionist.\\n\\nPrévost began as a jazz drummer before branching out into entirely improvised music. He was a co-founder of the group AMM, and remains its only constant member. Prévost has worked with several prominent jazz musicians, including saxophonist Lou Gare.\\n\\nIn 1965, along with tenor saxophonist Lou Gare, bassist Lawrence Sheaff and guitarist Keith Rowe, Prévost made a radical break with jazz, a music that had inspired these English musicians but couldn’t accommodate their rapidly expanding aesthetic concerns. Their dedicated inquiry into the terms of spontaneous creativity led them to reinvent music as a dialogue with the world beyond the limits of conventional musical discourse. They formed AMM, soon to be joined by distinguished composer Cornelius Cardew, an improvisation ensemble that has exerted influence internationally across a wide range of kinds of music, from contemporary composition to psychedelic rock, ambient soundscapes and industrial noise. During the late 1960s AMM occasionally played on the same bill as Pink Floyd. In 1968 American composer Christian Wolff spent his year in London as a member of AMM.\\n\\nIn the course of AMM’s rigorous scrutiny of music’s internal and external relations and of sound itself, Prévost revised his understanding of the nature and potential of percussion. He bowed cymbals, used drums as resonant amplifying ‘sound boxes’, incorporated ‘found objects’ into a growing battery of percussive elements that now includes gongs and a huge stringed contra-bass drum. He examined the very grain of the material at hand.\\n\\nAt the same time Prévost has remained at home with the jazz drum kit and those conventional techniques associated with it. Jazz has had a distinct referential role within several groups Prévost has been involved with, from The Eddie Prévost Band of the late 1970s with Geoff Hawkins on tenor, bassist Marcio Mattos and trumpeter Gerry Gold; to his trio; the Eddie Prévost Trio which began in the 1990s with Tom Chant and John Edwards and to a recent ensemble with saxophonist Alan Wilkinson and bassist Joe Williamson.\\n\\nPrévost still performs regularly with AMM (which currently consists of pianist John Tilbury and himself). The vital dynamic of all Prévost’s work is creative response to a specific context. His varied and ongoing discoveries within AMM, and his refinement of that group’s meta-musical philosophy, extend into his solo playing and into other diverse alignments, such as 9!, Sakada (with the live electronics and computers of Mattin and Rosy Parlane) or the trio with Jim O’Rourke and Takehisa Kosugi that accompanied Merce Cunningham’s dance company in 1998.\\n\\nPrévost’s life as a musician has encompassed encounters with an extraordinary range of instrumentalists including Evan Parker, Barry Guy, Paul Rutherford (trombone player), Tony Moore, Christian Wolff, Marilyn Crispell, John Wolf Brennan, Simon Picard, Shiku Yanu, Veryan Weston, Howard Riley, Max Eastley, Phillip Wachsman, Akemi Kuniyoshi, John Edwards, Tom Chant, Dave Jackman’s ‘Organum’, Yoshikazu Iwamoto, and Derek Bailey. As well as improvising and playing free jazz Prévost has performed challenging experimental compositions, especially those of his former associate Cornelius Cardew. Prévost has also subsequently collaborated with other rock-oriented groups, including GOD, Main and Sonic Boom’s ‘Experimental Audio Research.’ He has created music for experimental filmmakers — most notably Malcolm LeGrice, Vlasto Sudar and Gina Tornatore. He has played in most European countries including Russia, Lithuania and Turkey, in the USA, Canada and Japan and has convened workshops in Europe and America as well as in the UK.\\n\\nIn addition to making music Prévost lectures, writes, edits and publishes. His writings about the aesthetic priority of improvisation have appeared in numerous arts and music magazines e.g. Marina d’Art (Spain), Influenza (Denmark), Bad Alchemy (Germany), British Journal of Music Education (UK), Contact (UK), The Wire (UK) and Contemporary Music Review (UK). His keynote address to the 1999 Colloquium (part of the Guelph Jazz Festival) was reprinted in ‘The Other Side of Nowhere — jazz, improvisation, and communities in dialogue’ Ed. Daniel Fischlin and Ajay Heble, Wesleyan UP, 2004. From his home in Essex he runs the estimable imprint Matchless Recordings and its print offshoot Copula, which has published Prévost’s own books, Minute Particulars and No Sound Is Innocent, and recently issued an invaluable collection of essays, articles and statements by Cornelius Cardew. He has also been an active member of several organizations established to promote improvisation and creative music-making.\\n\\nFor nine years, Prévost has convened a weekly workshop on Friday nights in London. This has attracted over 300 musicians representing some 20 or more nationalities.\\n\\n“Definition of self can only occur within voluntary limitations of activity and expression. To prevent these limitations from solidifying into self-deceiving patterns of conceit, they have to be placed with confident uncertainty into the extra-personal life of community, the musical collective but also other communities.”EP, No Sound Is Innocent COPULA 1995\\n\\nsee AMM\\n\\n1969SILVER PYRAMIDMusic Now Ensemble performing Eddie Prévost’s text/visual piece Silver Pyramid including Lou Gare, Cornelius Cardew, Eddie Prévost Keith Rowe and others many of who becmae part of The Scratch Orchestra.

Formerly a treacherous hazard in the approaches to the English Channel and the port city of Plymouth, the rocks have played host to four iterations of the Eddystone Lighthouse, and are still home to the current lighthouse and the stub of its immediate predecessor.\\n\\nAlthough the nearest point on the mainland to the Eddystone is in Cornwall, the rocks fall within the city limits of Plymouth, and hence within the county of Devon.\\n\\nThere have been four lighthouses on the Eddystone Rocks. Winstanley (two versions; the second however just replaced the top of the structure), Rudyard, Smeaton and finally the Douglass Lighthouse which is the present one. When the Douglass Lighthouse was completed the people of Plymouth, grateful for the countless lives which had been saved since the introduction of the lighthouses, paid for the dismantling and reassembly of the Smeaton Lighthouse from the red rocks of Eddystone to Plymouth Hoe where it is a popular tourist attraction today.\\n\\nA traditional sea-shanty \"The Eddystone Light\" chronicles a fictional encounter between the lighthouse keeper and a mermaid, and has been recorded by The Seekers, the Weavers, and Peter Paul and Mary\\n\\nEddystone rock is something of an anomaly in South Western Geology; it is composed of garnetiferous gneiss rock which is part of considerable underwater outcrop of mica-schist and granitoid gneisses which have not been found elsewhere in South West England. Isotopic ages suggest that the last period of deformation was during the end of the Devonian, but their highly metamorphosed state indicates they likely have an older ancestry, a relic of earlier tectonic activity, probably Precambrian of age. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edgard Colle", "body": "Edgard Colle (18 May 1897 – 20 April 1932) was a Belgian chess master. He scored excellent results in major international tournaments, including first at Amsterdam 1926, ahead of Savielly Tartakower and future world champion Max Euwe; first at Meran 1926, ahead of Esteban Canal; and first at Scarborough 1930, ahead of Maróczy and Rubinstein.\\n\\nColle was born in Ghent, Belgium. His playing career was hampered by ill health. He survived three difficult operations for a gastric ulcer and died after a fourth at the age of 34 in Ghent.\\n\\nColle is remembered today primarily for his introduction of the chess opening now known as the Colle System: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3. White normally follows up with Bd3, 0-0, and Nbd2, playing for a central pawn break with e4. The opening is in effect a reversed Semi-Slav Defense. In response to ...c5 by Black, White typically plays c3. The Colle System was most often played in the late 1920s and 1930s. Colle himself played it from 1925 until his death in 1932. He won many games with this opening, including a number of brilliancies. Colle-O'Hanlon, Nice 1930, featuring one of the best-known examples of a Greek gift sacrifice, is especially famous.\\n\\nThe opening gained popularity, especially in the United States, through the efforts of Belgian-American International Master (and later honorary grandmaster) George Koltanowski, who remained faithful to it throughout his long career, and wrote several books on it. Koltanowski said he played the opening as a tribute to his friend Colle. The opening is sometimes referred to as the Colle-Koltanowski.\\n\\nThe Colle System fell out of favor in high-level play as good defenses were found for Black. Chess theory today regards it as safe but somewhat passive. However, because of its solid pawn structure, logical piece placement, and coherent strategic aims, the opening is often taught to novice players as a safe and dependable way to reach a playable middlegame. Thus, the Colle System is frequently seen in amateur and scholastic tournaments, but is not common in professional play. However, it has been used in recent times by grandmasters Pia Cramling, Susan Polgar, and most notably Artur Yusupov, who prefers to play with b3 and a queenside fianchetto, a setup known as the Colle-Zukertort.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edgeworth price cycle", "body": "An Edgeworth price cycle is an asymmetric price variation that has the following characteristics:\\n\\nBecause of (1), smaller competitors have a greater incentive to initiate cutting. Larger competitors will generally be the initiator of restorations. The cycle is asymmetric because restorations happen nearly simultaneously, but undercutting is generally slower.\\n\\nEdgeworth cycles are distinguished from both sticky pricing and cost-based pricing. Sticky prices are typically found in markets with less aggressive price competition, so there are fewer or no cycles. Purely cost-based pricing occurs when retailers mark up from wholesale costs, so costs follow wholesale variations closely.\\n\\nCompetitive gasoline markets with a high degree of independent or small retailers typically demonstrate Edgeworth cycling, while markets dominated by majors (vertically integrated firms) will tend toward sticky pricing. Because the cycles tend to occur frequently, weekly average prices found in government reports will generally mask the cycling. Some studies have shown the restorations to occur on Tuesdays, with undercutting beginning within the next two days.\\n\\n"}

She then went to work for Associated Charities, and studied at the New York School of Social Work. One of her instructors, George Kirchwey of Columbia, encouraged her to become an attorney. She studied law while working as a social worker in Chicago, taking night courses at John Marshall Law School, from 1922 to 1925.\\n\\nIn 1924, Sampson opened a law office on the South Side of Chicago, serving the local black community.

From 1943 to 1945 he taught at Shrewsbury School. He first became established under his own name as a composer of vocal and choral music, including An Oxford Requiem (1951), but later turned to film work, writing the scores for many British comedies of the 1950s. For the Carry On series he composed six scores, ending with Carry On Cruising, including the original Carry On theme subsequently adapted for later films by Eric Rogers. Montgomery was responsible for both the screenplay and score of Raising the Wind (1961).\\n\\nMontgomery wrote nine detective novels and two collections of short stories under the pseudonym Edmund Crispin (taken from a character in Michael Innes's Hamlet, Revenge!). The stories feature Oxford don Gervase Fen, who is a Professor of English at the university and a fellow of St Christopher's College, a fictional institution that Crispin locates next to St John's College. Fen is an eccentric, sometimes absent-minded, character reportedly based on the Oxford professor W. E. Moore. The whodunit novels have complex plots and fantastic, somewhat unbelievable solutions, including examples of the locked room mystery. They are written in a humorous, literary and sometimes farcical style and contain frequent references to English literature, poetry, and music. They are also among the few mystery novel to break the fourth wall occasionally and speak directly to the audience. Perhaps the best example is from The Moving Toyshop, during a chase sequence -- \"Let's go left\", Cadogan suggested. \"After all, Gollancz is publishing this book.\" \\n\\nGareth Roberts has stated that the tone of his Doctor Who novel The Well-Mannered War was modelled upon Crispin's style. He also remarks (of The Moving Toyshop) that \"It's more like Doctor Who than Doctor Who.\" Novelist Christopher Fowler pays homage to The Moving Toyshop in The Victoria Vanishes, his sixth Bryant & May novel. Crispin is considered by many to be one of the last great exponents of the 'classic' crime mystery.\\n\\nMontgomery's output of music and fiction all but ceased after the 1950s, but he continued to write reviews of crime novels and science fiction works for The Sunday Times.

While at Cambridge he became a friend of Gabriel Harvey, and later consulted him, despite their differing views on poetry.\\n\\nIn July 1580 Spenser went to Ireland, in the service of the newly appointed lord deputy, Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton. Then he served with the English forces during the Second Desmond Rebellion. After the defeat of the native Irish he was awarded lands in County Cork that had been confiscated in the Munster Plantation during the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland. Among his acquaintances in the area was Walter Raleigh, a fellow colonist.\\n\\nThrough his poetry Spenser hoped to secure a place at court, which he visited in Raleigh's company to deliver his most famous work, the Faerie Queene. However, he boldly antagonized the queen's principal secretary, Lord Burghley, and all he received in recognition of his work was a pension in 1591. When it was proposed that he receive payment of 100 pounds for his epic poem, Burghley remarked, \"What, all this for a song!\" \\n\\nthumbIn the early 1590s, Spenser wrote a prose pamphlet titled, A View of the Present State of Ireland. This piece remained in manuscript until its publication and print in the mid-seventeenth century. It is probable that it was kept out of print during the author's lifetime because of its inflammatory content. The pamphlet argued that Ireland would never be totally 'pacified' by the English until its indigenous language and customs had been destroyed, if necessary by violence. Spenser recommended scorched earth tactics, such as he had seen used in the Desmond Rebellions, to create famine. Although it has been highly regarded as a polemical piece of prose and valued as a historical source on 16th century Ireland, the View is seen today as genocidal in intent. Spenser did express some praise for the Gaelic poetic tradition, but also used much tendentious and bogus analysis to demonstrate that the Irish were descended from barbarian Scythian stock.\\n\\nTwo of Ireland's leading historians of the early modern period, Ciaran Brady and Nicholas Canny, have differed in their view of Spenser's View of the State of Ireland. Brady’s essential proposition is that Spenser wished the English government to undertake the extermination of most of the Irish population. He writes that Spenser preferred to write in dialogue form so that the crudity of his proposals would be masked. Canny undermines Brady's conclusion that Spenser opted for “a holocaust or a “blood-bath”, because despite Brady's claims Spenser did not choose the sword as his preferred instrument of policy. Canny argues that Spenser instead chose not the extermination of the Irish race but rather a policy of ‘social reform pursued by drastic means’. Canny's ultimate assertion was that Brady was over-reacting and that Spenser did not propose a policy to exterminate the Irish race. However, within one page he moves on to argue that no ‘English writer of the early modern period ever proposed such a drastic programme in social engineering for England, and it was even more dramatic than Brady allows for because all elements of the Irish population including the Old English of the towns, whom Brady seems to think were exempt were subject to some element of this scheme of dispersal, reintegration and re-education’[14]. Here, Canny argues that this policy was more ‘dramatic than Brady allows’, in that Brady’s description was one of ‘bloodshed’, ‘extermination’ and ‘holocaust’ only of the native Irish but Canny’s was one of dispersal, reintegration and re-education of both the native Irish and the settler English. Even though Canny writes that ‘substantial loss of life, including loss of civilian life, was considered by Spenser', he considers that that falls short of Brady's conclusion. For more details on this debate, read Brady's \"Spenser’s Irish Crisis: Humanism and Experience in the 1590s\" and Canny, Nicholas, \"Spenser's Irish Crisis: Humanism and Experience in the 1590s, a response to the claims of Brady\".\\n\\nLater on, during the Nine Years War in 1598, Spenser was driven from his home by the native Irish forces of Aodh Ó Néill. His castle at Kilcolman, near Doneraile in North Cork was burned, and it is thought one of his infant children died in the blaze – though local legend has it that his wife also died. He possessed a second holding to the south, at Rennie, on a rock overlooking the river Blackwater in North Cork. The ruins of it are still visible today. A short distance away grew a tree, locally known as \"Spenser's Oak\" until it was destroyed in a lightning strike in the 1960s. Local legend has it that he penned some or all of The Faerie Queene under this tree. Queen Victoria is said to have visited the tree while staying in nearby Convamore House during her state visit to Ireland.thumbIn the year after being driven from his home, Spenser travelled to London, where he died in distressed circumstances (according to legend), aged forty-six. It was arranged for his coffin to be carried by other poets, upon which they threw many pens and pieces of poetry into his grave with many tears.\\n\\nSpenser was called a Poet's Poet and was admired by William Wordsworth, John Keats, Lord Byron and Alfred Lord Tennyson, among others. The language of his poetry is purposely archaic, reminiscent of earlier works such as The Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer, whom Spenser greatly admired. \\n\\nSpenser's Epithalamion is the most admired of its type in the English language. It was written for his wedding to his young bride, Elizabeth Boyle. The poem consists of 365 long lines, corresponding to the days of the year; 68 short lines, representing the sum of the 52 weeks, 12 months, and 4 seasons of the annual cycle; and 24 stanzas, corresponding to the diurnal and sidereal hours.\\n\\nSpenser's masterpiece is the huge epic poem The Faerie Queene. The first three books of The Faerie Queene were published in 1590, and a second set of three books were published in 1596. This extended epic poem deals with the adventures of knights, dragons, ladies in distress, etc. yet it is also an extended allegory about the moral life and what makes for a life of virtue. Spenser originally indicated that he intended the poem to be twelve books long, so there is some argument about whether the version we have is in any real sense complete.\\n\\nSpenser used a distinctive verse form, called the Spenserian stanza, in several works, including The Faerie Queene. The stanza's main meter is iambic pentameter with a final line in iambic hexameter (having six feet or stresses, known as an Alexandrine), and the rhyme scheme is ababbcbcc. \\n\\nThe Spenserian Sonnet is based on a fusion of elements of both the Petrarchan sonnet and the Shakespearean sonnet. It is similar to the Shakespearan sonnet in the sense that its set up is based more on the 3 quatrains and a couplet,a system set up by Shakespeare; however it is more like the Petrarchan tradition in the fact that the conclusion follows from the argument or issue set up in the earlier quatrains. There is also a great use of the parody of the blason and the idealization or praise of the mistress, a literary device used by many poets. It is a way to look at a woman through the appraisal of her features in comparison to other things. In this description, the mistress's body is described part by part, i.e., much more of a scientific way of seeing one. As William Johnson states in his article \"Gender Fashioning and Dynamics of Mutuality in Spenser's Amoretti,\" the poet-love in the scenes of Spenser's sonnets in Amoretti, is able to see his lover in an objectified manner by moving her to another, or more clearly, an item. The purpose of Spenser doing this is to bring the woman from the \"transcendental ideal\" to a woman in everyday life. \"Through his use of metonymy and metaphor, by describing the lady not as a whole being but as bodily parts, by alluding to centuries of topoi which remove her in time as well as space, the poet transforms the woman into a text, the living 'other' into an inanimate object\" (503). The opposite of this also occurs in The Faerie Queen. The counter-blason, or the opposition of appraisal, is used to describe Duessa. She is not objectified, but instead all of her flaws are highlighted. In this context it should be noted that in Amoretti Spenser actually names his loved one as \"Elizabeth\" and that he puns humorously and often on her surname \"Boyle\". Similarly, Petrarch punned on the Christian name \"Laura\" in his Rime. This disguised use of names has been identified by Fred Blick in his article \"Spenser's Amoretti and Elizabeth Boyle, Her Names Immortalized\", Spenser Studies Vol. 23, 2008. (309-315)\\n\\nSpenser is also the man believed to have crafted the phrase \"without reason or a rhyme\". He was promised payment from the Queen of one hundred pounds, a so called, \"reason for the rhyme\". The Lord High Treasurer William Cecil, however, considered the sum too much. After a long while without receiving his payment, he sent her this quatrain:\\n\\nShe immediately ordered Cecil to send Spenser his due sum.\\n\\n1591:\\n\\n1592:\\n\\n1595:\\n\\n1596:\\n\\nPosthumous:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ednyfed Fychan", "body": "Ednyfed Fychan (c. 1170 - 1246), full name Ednyfed Fychan ap Cynwrig, was a Welsh warrior who became seneschal to the Kingdom of Gwynedd in Northern Wales, serving Llywelyn the Great and his son Dafydd ap Llywelyn. He was a descendant (9th in descent) of Marchudd ap Cynan, Lord of Rhos, Lord Protector of Rhodri Mawr, King of Gwynedd and the ancestor of Owen Tudor and thereby of the Tudor dynasty.\\n\\nAs is usual with medieval orthography, a variety of spellings were used for his name in medieval sources, such as Vychan and Idneved Vachan. Fychan meaning literally \"small\" but also \"junior\" or \"younger\" is the origin of the common Welsh personal name Vaughan.\\n\\n150pxEdnyfed is said to have first come to notice in battle, fighting against the army of Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester, who attacked Llywelyn at the behest of King John of England. Ednyfed cut off the heads of three English lords in battle and carried them, still bloody, to Llywelyn, who commanded him to change his family coat of arms to display three heads in memory of the feat.\\n\\nIn 1215 he succeeded Gwyn ab Ednywain as seneschal (\"distain\" in Welsh) of Gwynedd, roughly equivalent to Chief Councillor or Prime Minister. His titles included Lord of Bryn Ffanigl, Lord of Criccieth, and Chief Justice. He was involved in the negotiations leading to the Peace of Worcester in 1218 and represented Llywelyn in a meeting with the king of England in 1232. \\n\\nEdnyfed had estates at Bryn Ffanigl Isaf near Abergele and at Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, now a suburb of Colwyn Bay. These were the palace of Llys Euryn on the hill of Bryn Euryn, and Rhos Fynach on the sea shore below it. He also held lands in Llansadwrn and presumably also on Anglesey where his son had his seat. \\n\\nEdnyfed was married twice, first to Tangwystl Goch ferch Llywarch, of Menai (but perhaps of Rhos?), the daughter of Llywarch ap Brân, then to Gwenllian, daughter of the prince Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth (order incorrect?).\\n\\nEdnyfed probably went on a crusade to the Holy Land around 1235, although the evidence is not conclusive.\\n\\nGwenllian died in 1236. On Llywelyn the Great's death in 1240, Ednyfed continued as seneschal in the service of Llywelyn's son, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, until his own death in 1246. One of his sons was captured and killed by the English in the war of 1245.\\n\\nEdnyfed was buried in his own chapel, now Llandrillo Church, which was enlarged to became the parish church after the previous one (Dinerth Parish Church) had been inundated by the sea during Ednyfed's lifetime. His tombstone, was reputed to lie near the altar of Llandrillo Church, now in a vertical position in one of the arches., but this is disputed as the name inscribed is an Ednyfed ap Bleddyn 'quondam vicarius' (sometime vicar) of the parish in the 16th century.\\n\\nTwo other sons were successively seneschals of Gwynedd under Llywelyn the Last. After Llywelyn's death in 1282 the family made its peace with the English crown, though a descendant joined the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294-5, acting as Madog's seneschal after his proclamation of himself as prince of Wales. Ednyfed's son Goronwy gave rise to the Penmynydd branch of the family in Anglesey, from whom Owen Tudor and later Henry VII were descended.\\n\\nAccording to folk tradition, Ednyfed is said to have composed a farewell song to Gwenllian before leaving to take part in the Crusades. He was away for several years, and his family thought him dead. According to an old Welsh tale, Gwenllian accepted another offer of marriage. On the wedding night, a 'pitiable beggar' arrived at the house and asked permission to borrow a harp with which to entertain the party with a song. According to this legend the beggar sang Ednyfed's Farewell song and as he reached the last verse, removed his hat, revealing himself to be Ednyfed. He sang:Ednyfed then announced to the stunned throng:\\n\\nBy first marriage he had: \\n\\nBy second marriage he had: \\n\\nBy either of his marriages he had: \\n\\nBy an unknown woman he had, illegitimate: \\n\\n:General reference:\\n\\n"}

In addition to the Ranger's base trim appoints, the Pacer received contoured seat backs, nylon upholstery cloth, color-keyed rubber floor mats, and extra stainless steel exterior and interior trim pieces and window moldings. A basic heater (as a US$92 option) and radio (at US$95) were available, and air conditioning was optional as well (at $417).\\n\\nAll Pacers rode on Ford's 118 in (2997 mm) wheelbase (except the wagons, which used a 116 in {2946 mm} wheelbase) and shared the Ranger’s engine choices, with a 303 hp (226 kW) 361 in³ (5.9 L) E-400 V8 (with two-barrel carburetor) as standard. (The 345 hp (257 kW) E-475 410 in³ (6.7 L), standard in the Corsair and Citation, was not available.) A three-speed manual transmission was also standard. Buyers also could upgrade to a three-speed automatic transmission with a standard column-mounted gear selector, or choose Edsel’s highly promoted but trouble-prone Teletouch automatic, which placed its drive-selection buttons in the steering wheel hub, as a US$231 option.\\n\\nWhile its roll-out was highly publicized in the fall of 1957, the 1958 Edsel was a marketing disaster for Ford and for Ford's corporate strategy for meeting General Motors product line for product line.

{"title": "Education of freed people during the Civil War", "body": "The American Civil War led to enormous cultural changes throughout the United States. No group experienced a more radical shift than slaves who were freed as the Union Army swept through the South. While there was no initial plan for addressing the specific needs of the slave population, Union generals quickly recognized their impoverishment and suffering, and sought to provide education and material support both for civilians and for former slaves who enlisted with Union forces.\\n\\nAs slaves were liberated by advancing forces, education quickly became one of their highest priorities. They saw literacy as a means of empowerment and social advancement. However, economic necessities, ongoing warfare, outbreaks of cholera and dysentery, and their overwhelming numbers made education both a dangerous and difficult endeavor. Throughout the South, generals and their staffs sought to establish and maintain order by providing basic education and training.\\n\\nWhile the War Department made no initial provision for the slaves, many generals, most notably General William Tecumseh Sherman, advocated providing immediate aid and appealed to various philanthropic agencies to send teachers to provide religious and vocational instruction. \\n\\nGeneral Ulysses S. Grant was the first to deliberately and formally respond to the plight of the African-American community when he appointed General John Eaton as Superintendent for Negro Affairs in the Department of Tennessee. Eaton's authority ranged over an area that included not only Tennessee, but portions of Kentucky and Mississippi, as well. He worked to provide teachers with lodging, funding, transportation, and protection. He later divided the region into districts, developed standard curricula, and attempted to obtain standard textbooks. His efforts met with success. By 1864, the Department of Tennessee had established 74 schools in the region, serving more than 6200 pupils (Blassingame, p. 153).\\n\\nGeneral Benjamin Franklin Butler, who was responsible for Virginia and North Carolina, was also proactive. He appointed Lt. Col. J. B. Kinsman as chief of a Department of Negro Affairs and directed him to ensure that blacks would receive both secular and religious instruction. Philanthropic agencies provided teachers and supplies; the army provided funding, transportation, and lodging. Kinsman emphasized vocational training as well as literacy instruction. Former slaves learned carpentry, weaving, shoemaking, and other trades, as well as how to read and write. By 1864, North Carolina had more than 60 teachers and 3000 students in Kinsman's program (Blassingame, p. 153).\\n\\nThe Department of the Gulf, which encompassed Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama, was overseen by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, who established a Board of Education and sought to provide basic literacy and job training. The Board received a mandate to: establish schools in each parish, appoint teachers and require them to attend Board-sponsored annual training, develop a standard curriculum, levy taxes to provide funding, and provide books to students, at cost. \\n\\nIn this region, however, there was widespread opposition to African-American education, and whites often refused to help teachers; some attacked the teachers and their schools directly. When planters refused to lodge teachers, banks threatened to remove their laborers, so the planters finally crumbled under the economic pressure. Despite these tensions, by the end of 1864, the Board had successfully established 95 schools, providing instruction to more than 9500 children and 2000 adults (Blasingame, p. 154).\\n\\nWhile the education of civilian populations was an admirable and necessary aim of the Union forces, a more pressing need was the instruction of former slaves who actually enlisted. Almost immediately, officers recognized the problems that resulted from illiteracy: verbal instructions and explanations cost valuable time, and despite the courage of these new troops, advancement without some degree of education was impossible, and this led to a loss of morale. Numerous regiments, including the 33rd, 55th, 67th, 73rd, 76th, 78th, 83rd, 88th, 89th, and the 128th received instruction from chaplains and Northern teachers. Not only was this training designed to improve the soldiers’ wartime efficacy, but by learning trades like bricklaying and carpentry, they felt more secure about their longterm stability. \\n\\nJust as General Benjamin Franklin Butler had taken an active role in civilian education in North Carolina and Virginia, when he united 37 regiments to form the Twenty-Fifth Corps in December 1864, he ordered that chaplains oversee schools in each regiment: “thus, with a stroke of his pen, Butler guaranteed that 29,875 Negro soldiers would receive systematic instruction” (p. 157). Under his orders, taxes were levied to fund these schools and officers were threatened with dishonorable discharges if their soldiers did not improve in terms of discipline and education. Further, soldiers were offered tangible rewards for attending classes. Not only did learning and literacy predicate promotion, but soldiers could receive popular books, especially the Bible, exemption from certain duties, and day passes through these programs.\\n\\nThousands of freedmen received their first formal instruction through the involvement of the Union Army. These programs laid the groundwork for agencies such as the Freedmen’s Bureau and encouraged the intellectual and professional development of civilians and soldiers alike.\\n\\nBlassingame, John W.

{"title": "Educational Television (Hong Kong)", "body": "Educational Television (), shortly known as ETV, is a series of educational television programmes jointly produced by Radio Television Hong Kong and the Education and Manpower Bureau (formerly the Education Department) of Hong Kong. ETV has been an auxiliary means for teaching the primary and secondary school curriculum on television since the early 1970s. ETV programmes change with the curriculum from time to time, covering a wide spectrum of topics. Programmes are broadcast during daytime non-peak hours on the English channels of TVB and ATV from Monday to Friday, during the 32 weeks of the school year. As the popularity of the Internet has increased, ETV has made its programmes available on the world wide web on demand.\\n\\nETV began with the primary school curriculum and developed gradually. In 1972, the first programme was aimed at Primary 3 students. It extended one level up yearly and covered Primary 6 in 1974. In September 1976, ETV started to cover junior secondary school. It began with Secondary 1 and reached Secondary 3 in 1978. There was no major change in range until 1999. ETV extended to Primary 1 and 2 in junior primary and Secondary 4 and 5 on selected topics in senior secondary school. In 2000, ETV also began to broadcast Teacher Resource Programmes for teachers.\\n\\nThe programmes are closely tied with the curriculum devised by Hong Kong Government. Most of programmes are in the Cantonese language. In the early days, it covered the primary subjects of Chinese language, English language and Mathematics, and the secondary subjects Social Studies, Health Education (absent in secondary school) and Nature (later renamed to Science). Programme topics are changed weekly for primary school and biweekly for secondary school. The length of a programme is 15 minutes for primary school and 20 for secondary. Later the secondary subjects were merged to General Studies for primary school as the curriculum changed. As Putonghua has become increasingly important in Hong Kong, it was introduced into the Hong Kong curriculum, and ETV now produces programmes in the language. Social Studies for secondary schools was renamed to Personal, Social and Humanities Education.\\n\\nDuring normal school terms, ETV programmes are broadcast from Monday to Friday (except some long school vacations like Christmas holidays, Lunar New Year holidays, Easter holidays and Summer holidays) on the free TV channels TVB Pearl and ATV World, alternately, so that one of the stations broadcasts ETV programmes in the morning (8am - noon) and the other broadcasts them in the afternoon (noon - 4pm) time slot. In each academic year, the two stations' ETV broadcasting periods swap over.\\n\\nAlthough each programme is broadcast several times a week, their broadcast times are not adapted to school class timetables. The government therefore provides necessary television and recording equipment for reception of ETV programmes for government schools and aided schools in Hong Kong. The recorded programmes can then be viewed out of the broadcast time frame as required by the school.\\n\\nSome programmes are distributed in form of VCD or interactive multimedia CD-ROM to schools.\\n\\nWith the coming of the Internet age, ETV programmes and other materials can be obtained from ETV website eTVonline.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edward A. Vincent", "body": "right\\n\\nEdward Arista Vincent (c. 1825 – November 27, 1856) was an architect, cartographer, and civil engineer, known for his design for the antebellum railroad depot destroyed by the Union Army during the occupation of Atlanta in the American Civil War.\\n\\nVincent was probably born in London, immigrating to the United States in 1849. Living first in New York City, he moved to Savannah, Georgia, in 1851. He became a U.S. citizen in 1852. That year he launched himself into the public eye, advertising his services as a civil engineer and architect in Savannah, Macon, and Augusta newspapers. According to Caldwell, he was more likely an engineer rather than an architect. He had offices in Macon, Augusta, and Atlanta. Vincent fell suddenly ill in November 1856 and died twelve days later. He was about thirty years old. His body was interred in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta.\\n\\nright\\n\\nVincent was hired by the Western and Atlantic Railroad in 1852 to design a modern passenger depot in Atlanta. It was built by Henry Franklin Jeffries and was completed in April 1853. It was 300 feet long and 100 feet wide included a ticket office, baggage storage rooms, waiting rooms, and a food stand. According to Caldwell, \"no structure could have spoken more eloquently for the new city than this purely utilitarian\" building.\\n\\nIn 1864, the depot was demolished by Federal troops under the command of General Sherman during the occupation of Atlanta. Neither Vincent nor Jeffries lived to witness the depot's destruction. Although Vincent advertised himself widely as an architect, no other examples of his work are currently known.\\n\\nA scaled-down copy of Vincent's Depot has been recreated in Atlanta's Stone Mountain Park.\\n\\nleft\\n\\nVincent's first and most ambitious cartographic project was his 1853 city map of Savannah. Measuring fifty-one inches wide and fifty inches tall, the detailed map included outlines of all structures in the city, both public and private. Brick and wood buildings were identified by different fill patterns. It was delivered to the Savannah city council by March 24, 1853.\\n\\nOn February 16, 1853, the Atlanta city council approved Vincent's proposal to produce a map of that city. It was completed by November 18, 1853, because the city council resolved that copies should be sent to the mayors of Georgia's other major cities.\\n\\nFollowing the completion of his Atlanta map, the city of Macon hired Vincent to survey the city, produce a map, and direct the construction of a new sewer system. The city council challenged Vincent's survey methods and required that the city survey be re-staked. The city paid Vincent for fifty copies of his map, but required that a disclaimer be written on each one indemnifying the city from any legal challenge based on errors in the map.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edward Fitzgerald Beale", "body": "rightEdward Fitzgerald \"Ned\" Beale (February 4, 1822 – April 22, 1893) was a national figure in 19th century America. He was naval officer, military general, explorer, frontiersman, Indian affairs superintendent, California rancher, diplomat, and friend of Kit Carson, Buffalo Bill Cody and Ulysses S. Grant. He fought in the Mexican-American War, emerging as a hero of the Battle of San Pasqual in 1846. He achieved national fame in 1848 in carrying to the east the first gold samples from California, contributing to the gold rush. \\n\\nHe surveyed and built a wagon road that many settlers used to move to the West, and which became part of Route 66 and the route for the Transcontinental railroad. As California's first Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Beale helped charter a humanitarian policy towards Native Americans in the 1850s. He also founded the Tejon Ranch in California, the largest private landholding in the United States, and became a millionaire several times over. He received appointments from five U.S. Presidents: Andrew Jackson appointed him to Naval School, Millard Fillmore appointed him Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California and Nevada, James Buchanan appointed him to survey a wagon road from New Mexico to California, Abraham Lincoln appointed him Surveyor General of California and Nevada, and Ulysses S. Grant appointed him Ambassador to Austria–Hungary.\\n\\n\"Beale successfully pursued a personal El Dorado of adventure, status, and wealth,\" wrote Gerald Thompson. \"In doing so, he mirrored the dreams of countless Americans of his day.\"\\n\\nNed Beale was born in Washington, D.C. His father, George Beale, who was a paymaster in the U.S. Navy, had earned a Congressional Medal for Valor in the War of 1812. His mother, Emily, was the daughter of Commodore Thomas Truxtun of the U.S. Navy. Ned was a student at Georgetown University when, at the solicitation of his widowed mother, President Jackson appointed him to the Naval School in Philadelphia. From 1837 to 1842, Beale was an acting midshipman on naval ships that sailed to Russia, Brazil and the West Indies. He graduated from the Naval School as a midshipman in 1842, and sailed for two years in Europe and South America. In 1845 he was assigned to the squadron of Captain Robert F. Stockton, a wealthy New Jersey businessman and inventor as well as a career naval officer, who was an intimate of presidents. Beale sailed with Stockton's squadron to Texas, where Stockton met with the Texas Congress, which accepted annexation by the United States. \\n\\nAfter a promotion to acting master and private secretary to Stockton, Beale sailed for California and Oregon in 1845 on the ''Congress'', but 20 days later Stockton instructed Beale to board a Danish ship they had encountered and sail to England, where Beale was to disguise his identity and seek information on the British feelings on the Oregon boundary. Back in Washington in 1846, Beale reported his findings to President James Polk that the British had been making warlike preparations. Promoted to the position of master, Beale carried packages for Navy Secretary Bancroft to Stockton, sailing to Panama, crossing by the isthmus by boat and mule, and then sailing to Peru to meet up with Stockton and the Congress in 1846. He sailed with Stockton to Honolulu, and then to California. Hostilities with Mexico had already begun when the vessel reached Monterey, California on July 20, 1846. \\n\\nAfter reaching San Diego, California, Stockton dispatched Beale to serve with the land forces. Beale and a small body of men under Lt. Archibald Gillespie joined General Stephen W. Kearny's column just before the Battle of San Pasqual on December 6, 1846. After the Mexican Army surrounded the small American force and threatened to destroy it, Beale and two other men (his Delaware Indian servant and Kit Carson) crept through the Mexican lines and made their way to San Diego for reinforcements. Two months later, although Beale still suffered from the effects his adventure, Stockton again sent him east with dispatches. Beale reached Washington about June 1. In October he appeared as a defense witness for John C. Frémont at the \"Pathfinder's\" court martial. \\n\\nWithin the next two years, Beale made six more journeys across the country. On the second of these (July–September 1848), he crossed Mexico in disguise to bring the federal government proof of California's gold. After the fourth journey he married Pennsylvania Representative Samuel Edwards' daughter, Mary, on June 27, 1849. They had three children: Mary (1852–1925), Emily (1854-?), and Truxtun (1856–1936). Beale was promoted to Lieutenant in 1850. He resigned from the Navy in 1851.\\n\\nIn his lifetime, Beale saw San Francisco grow from an isolated village of five houses to a city of 300,000 residents.\\n\\nAfter leaving the Navy, Beale returned to California as a manager for W. H. Aspinwall and Commodore Stockton, who had acquired large properties in there. In 1853, President Fillmore appointed Beale Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California and Nevada. Congress appropriated $250,000 to improve native conditions in Beale's district. On his way to California, Beale left Washington on May 6 with a party of 13 and surveyed a route across Colorado and Utah to Los Angeles, California, for the First Transcontinental Railroad. He reached Los Angeles on August 22. Beale served as Superintendent until 1856. California Governor John Bigler appointed Beale a Brigadier General in the California state militia to give Beale additional authority to negotiate peace treaties between the Native Americans and the U.S. Army.\\n\\nIn 1861, Beale was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as Surveyor General of California and Nevada. He had an important passage named after him due to his widening of a cut used by the Butterfield Overland Mail, a stagecoach that operated mail between St. Louis, Missouri and San Francisco. In 1862, he dispatched a crew of Chinese workers to widen an 1858 cut, which also reduced the climb by . Beale's Cut, as it was known, lasted as a transportation passage through the modern day Newhall Pass area until the construction of the Newhall Tunnel was completed in 1910. Still in existence today, Beale's cut is no longer passable by automobiles. It is difficult to find today because it is fenced off and not close enough to the Sierra Highway to be easily seen.\\n\\nIn 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Beale to survey and build a  wagon road from Fort Defiance, New Mexico to the Colorado River, on the border between Arizona and California. The survey also incorporated an experiment using camels, first proposed by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis four years earlier. Beale took his Camel Corps, comprising 25 camels imported from Tunis, as pack animals during this expedition and on another in 1858 through 1859 to extend the road from Fort Smith, Arkansas to the Colorado River. His camel driver was Hi Jolly. The camels were capable of traveling for days without water, carried much heavier loads than mules, and could thrive on forage that mules wouldn’t touch. But the camels scared horses and mules, and the Army declined to continue the experiment with camels. Nevertheless, the wagon road Beale built became a popular immigrant trail during the 1860s and 1870s, and it was this survey which marked out for the first time a practicable highway along the 35th parallel that has been used from that day to this. The general route of the Beale Wagon Road was followed by U.S. Route 66, the Sante Fe Railway, and Interstate 40.\\n\\nOf this road, Beale wrote: \"... It is the shortest (route) from our western frontier by 300 miles, being nearly directly west. It is the most level, our wagons only double-teaming once in the entire distance, and that at a short hill, and over a surface heretofore unbroken by wheels or trail on any kind. It is well-watered! Our greatest distance without water at any time being twenty miles ... It crosses the great desert (which must be crossed by any road to California) at its narrowest point.\" \\n\\n\"In opening this highway,\" wrote Gerald Thompson, \"Beale joined the small group of explorers who left an enduring mark on the American West during the nineteenth century.\"\\n\\nPortions of the original wagon road are still visible.\\n\\nthumb the urging of Beale, Fort Tejon was established by the U.S. Army in 1854 , to protect and control the Indians who were living on the Sebastian Indian Reservation, and to protect both the Indians and white settlers from raids by the Paiute, Chemeheui, Mojave and other Indian groups of the desert regions to the east. Fort Tejon was abandoned in 1864. In 1865 and 1866, Beale purchased the Mexican land grants which now comprise the  Tejon Ranch. When the U.S. Army sold its camels, Beale purchased some of them and kept them at his ranch. Tejon Ranch is the largest private landholding in California, and today is owned by Tejon Ranch Company, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: TRC).\\n\\nIn 1871, Beale purchased Decatur House, opposite the White House, in Washington, D.C. Decatur House had been built in 1818 for naval hero Stephen Decatur. Its prominent location across from the White House made Decatur House one of the capital's most desirable addresses and home of many of the nation's most prominent figures. The U.S. government rented Decatur House for its Secretaries of State, Henry Clay, Martin Van Buren and Judah P. Benjamin. Beale bought the house for $60,000 and extensively renovated it. He held many glittering parties there and became Washington's most famous host. A reporter from the Washington Capital wrote in 1873 that \"the old Decatur mansion will again rank first among the fashionable residences of our city.\"  Decatur House also became the unofficial meeting place for the Republican Stalwarts, and Ulysses S. Grant frequently stayed there. Beale's daughter-in-law, Marie, bequeathed Decatur House to the National Trust in 1956.\\n\\nPresident Grant appointed Beale, Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, in 1876. He served from 1876–1877, and displayed a talent for diplomacy. His lavish entertaining, tales of the American West, command of foreign languages, and warm personality made Beale and his wife popular figures in the Viennese court. His love of horses helped him win the trust of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. During his tenure, Beale sent frequent dispatches to the State Department on the war between Turkey and Serbia and the Eastern Question.\\n\\nIn his retirement, Beale lived at Decatur House, with yearly visits to Tejon Ranch and more frequent visits to his horse farm at Ash Hill in Hyattsville, northeast of Washington, D.C.

{"title": "Edward Higgins", "body": "Edward John Higgins (26 November 1864 – 14 December 1947) was the third General of The Salvation Army (1929-1934).\\n\\nHe was born in Highbridge, Somerset, England. His father became a much revered Commissioner in the Army's ranks, and travelled extensively in the interests of the organisation. His mother died when he was 8 years of age.\\n\\nHe became an officer in 1882 at the age of 17. Most of his earlier career was spent as an officer in the United States. During his time as an officer in the U.S., there was great divisions amongst the American Salvationists. He was known as the peace maker, thus earning him a lot of respect. In 1888, he married Captain Catherine Price. \\n\\nWhen Higgins was 42 years of age, Commissioner and Chief of the Staff Bramwell Booth gave him the oversight of the evangelistic work in the United Kingdom. By this time, Higgins was a great speaker, and had a lot of leadership skills which was needed in this role.\\n\\nThe Siege of London was a 10 day effort that took place in November 1912. It was an attempt to bring a prayer service to the people out in the core of London. It was such a huge success that it was repeated in 1913.\\n\\nIn 1919, General Bramwell Booth appointed him as his Chief of the Staff. Edward was never one to lead a political agenda, but he took his new role in stride. However, 1929 was a real test for Edward and a critical time in the history of The Salvation Army, the calling of the first High Council to elect a new General. General Bramwell Booth was asked to resign because of his ill health over the past several months. He refused, however, and was then reluctantly deposed from office, to be succeeded in the election of Edward. As General Booth sued, the matter was put in the hands of the court. The court ruled in favour of the High Council. Thus, Edward was the first General to be elected by the High Council.\\n\\nAs leader of the International Salvation Army, General Higgins still had his personal touch and warmth towards others. During his term in office as the General, he allowed a centenary of William Booth's birth to be celebrated. He also presided over a gathering in the Royal Albert Hall, and among those taking part was then Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. Stanley Baldwin.\\n\\nWhen he retired, his farewell meeting was held at the Royal Albert Hall, on November 1, 1934, and was presided over by the then Duke of York (later to become King George), who was accompanied by the Duchess, later known as Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother.\\n\\nThe General and his wife then went to live in Florida, and later moved to Canada. He continued to prove himself a true \"son of the Army\" by maintaining as much interest in the relatively small corps around them as he had done in the greater issues when in office.\\tMrs General Catherine Higgins died in 1952.\\n\\nHiggins wrote a number of books, including Stewards of God and Personal Holiness.\\n\\nGeneral Edward Higgins died at age 83.\\n\\n"}

Edward entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in November 1650, but left the university in 1651 to work as a bookseller's clerk in London.\\n\\nAlthough he did not share Milton's religious and political views, and seems, to judge from the free character of his Mysteries of Love and Eloquence (1658), to have undergone a certain revulsion from his Puritan upbringing, he remained on affectionate terms with his uncle to the end. He was tutor to the son of John Evelyn, the diarist, from 1663 to 1672 at Sayes Court, Deptford, and in 1677-1679 in the family of Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington, a prominent Roman Catholic.

He also wrote The New World of English Words (1658), which went through many editions; a new edition of Baker's Chronicle, of which the section on the period from 1650 to 1658 was written by himself from the royalist standpoint; a supplement (1676) to John Speed's Theatre of Great Britain; and in 1684 Enchiridion linguae latinae, said to have been taken chiefly from notes prepared by Milton. John Aubrey states that all Milton's papers came into Phillips's hands, and in 1694 he published a translation of his Letters of State with a valuable memoir.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edward the Blue Engine", "body": "Edward the Blue Engine is a fiction anthropomorphic steam locomotive from The Railway Series children's books by the Rev W. Awdry, and the related TV Series Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. He is a blue 4-4-0 tender engine with red stripes, about the same size as James the Red Engine, and has the number 2 on his tender. Also like James, he is a mixed traffic engine, meaning that he can easily pull freight or passengers, though he prefers freight. He is one of the major characters in both the books and the television series.\\n\\nEdward is a kind engine, who is always keen to help a friend in need. The younger engines can always rely on him to lend a listening ear and sympathetic advice. He works hard and will always do his utmost to get a job done.\\n\\nHowever, the big engines tend to see him as old-fashioned and slow. It is true that he is the oldest engine on the Fat Controller's railway (indeed, he helped to build it), but he has proved time and time again that despite his age he is entirely capable of working as hard as any engine. Several of the stories revolving around him, both in the books and television series, have involved Edward proving his worth to the others. Two of the most notable were 'Old Iron', in which he earned himself an overhaul by capturing a runaway James, and 'Edward's Exploit', in which he brought home a special train despite a breakdown, caused by one of his coupling rods breaking.\\n\\nEdward has a branch line which he runs with BoCo, a diesel engine. Edward is equally happy with coaches or trucks, but he has also been known to help other engines with heavy loads, pull special trains and even act as a pilot engine for the Royal Train.\\n\\nEdward was first featured in ''The Three Railway Engines'', Awdry's first book, in 1945. Edward featured in his own book, ''Edward the Blue Engine'' in 1954.\\n\\nEdward is the only engine whose driver and fireman are named in The Railway Series (Henry's driver was named in the annuals, being 'Ted'). In the foreword to 'Edward the Blue Engine', their names are given as Charlie Sand and Sidney Hever, and in the story 'Saved from Scrap', their names are mentioned.\\n\\nThese names are pun on their jobs. One of an engine driver's jobs is to sand the rails when they are slippery in order to allow the engine to grip. A fireman's job is to \"heave\" the coal from the tender or coal bunker to the engine's fire.\\n\\nTheir first names come from a real engine crew named Charlie and Sidney on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway (see Toby the Tram Engine).\\n\\nEdward was the first character created for The Railway Series in 1943. The inspiration for the character came from the Rev. W. Awdry watching trains on the Great Western Railway as a child. He said in interviews with Brian Sibley that to him, the noise of the locomotives' exhaust almost sounded like dialogue. For instance, the larger engines having trouble climbing the hills would appear to be saying, \"I can't do it, I can't do it,\" and the smaller engines helping them would sound like they were saying, \"I will do it! I will do it! I will do it!\" This was the direct inspiration for the second story in The Three Railway Engines, 'Edward and Gordon'. The first story was 'Edward's Day Out', which was an introduction to the character.\\n\\nUnlike later characters in the Railway Series, Edward is not directly based upon any particular class of locomotive, but is a generic 4-4-0. The Rev. W. Awdry has claimed that Edward is based on a heavily modified Sharp, Stewart &amp; Co. \"Larger Seagull\" locomotive supplied to the Furness Railway in 1896, but this is a piece of retcon created for the book ''The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways''. Martin Clutterbuck notes that Edward bears a closer resemblance to certain Scottish locomotives of the North British Railway, notably the D20. It is likely that Awdry chose the Furness Railway locomotive because the Furness Railway was the closest mainland railway to Sodor.\\n\\nThe Furness origin for Edward is once again brought up in book 41 ''Thomas and Victoria'', as Edward and Victoria are both from that area.\\n\\nEdward is one of the eight engines in The Steam Team.\\n\\nIn recent episodes of the TV series, Edward has been portrayed as a bank engine, to help engines up Gordon's Hill – a reminiscent nod to the Season 1 Story Edward and Gordon. \\n\\nIn Season 10, Edward appears almost as cheeky and inexperienced as Thomas was in the first season. This is especially evident in the episode Edward Strikes Out, where he went as far as to call a new arrival \"new-fangled nonsense\". After this little mishap he became his old self again.\\n\\nEdward did not appear in the film, Thomas and the Magic Railroad. However, he did appear in the film's straight-to-DVD sequel, Calling All Engines. He also appears in The Great Discovery, Hero of the Rails and Misty Island Rescue.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edwina Currie", "body": "Edwina Currie née Cohen (born 13 October 1946) is a former British Member of Parliament. First elected as a Conservative Party MP in 1983, she was a Junior Health Minister for two years, before resigning in 1988 over the controversy over salmonella in eggs. By the time Currie lost her seat in 1997, she had begun a new career as a novelist and broadcaster.\\n\\nCurrie was born in South Liverpool, England to an Orthodox Jewish family, although she has identified herself as Jewish only in the cultural sense—she does not subscribe to what she calls \"religious mumbo jumbo\". A pupil at Liverpool Institute High School for Girls, she studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at St Anne's College, Oxford University; subsequently, she gained a MA in economic history from the London School of Economics. She was a contemporary of figures including Christopher Hitchens, Robert Jackson, William Waldegrave, John Redwood, Stephen Milligan, John Scarlett, William Blair, Bill Clinton and Gyles Brandreth.\\n\\nFrom 1975 until 1986, she was a Birmingham City Council for Northfield. In 1983, she stood for parliament as a Conservative Party candidate, and was elected as the member for South Derbyshire. Frequently outspoken, she was described as \"a virtually permanent fixture on the nation's TV screen saying something outrageous about just about anything\" and \"the most outspoken and sexually interested woman of her political generation.\"\\n\\nIn September 1986, she became a Junior Health Minister. Among her comments over the next two years were, despite being not religious, saying that \"Good Christian people\" don't get AIDS, telling old people who couldn't afford their heating bills that they should wrap up warm in winter, and telling northerners that they die of \"Ignorance and chips\".\\n\\nCurrie was forced to resign in December 1988 after she issued a warning about salmonella in British eggs. The claim, that \"most of the egg production in this country, sadly, is now affected with salmonella\" sparked outrage among farmers and egg producers, and caused egg sales in the country to rapidly decline. This caused particular anger in Northern Ireland where egg production is a significant part of the economy—and at the Christmas party of the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland that year the featured dish was curried eggs. To make amends, in 1990 she began the National Egg Awareness Campaign. The controversy gained her the nickname 'Eggwina'.\\n\\nIn 1991, she was the first Conservative MP to appear on the BBC topical panel show Have I Got News For You. Currie subsequently appeared again, two years later, in a special episode commemorating the release of Margaret Thatcher's memoirs, opposite fellow Liverpudlian (and Liverpool Institute alumnus) Derek Hatton.\\n\\nDuring the 1992 General Election campaign, Currie poured a glass of orange juice over Labour's Peter Snape shortly after an edition of the Midlands based television debate show Central Weekend had finished airing. Speaking about the incident later, Currie said \"I just looked at my orange juice, and looked at this man from which this stream of abuse was emanating, and thought 'I know how to shut you up.' \"Snape subsequently won £15,000 after Currie \"falsely suggested in her memoirs that it happened after Snape had been 'drinking vodka in a club with cronies'.\"\\n\\nAfter the 1992 General Election, she declined a request from prime minister John Major to take up a position as Minister of State for the Home Office, as it would have again involved working with Kenneth Clarke, who had been Secretary of State for Health in 1988 and who had just been appointed Home Secretary.\\n\\nIn February 1994, she tabled an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill to lower the age of consent for male homosexual sexual acts to 16. This amendment was defeated by 307 votes to 280, although a subsequent amendment resulted in the reduction of the homosexual age of consent from 21 to 18; final equalisation was achieved in 2000. Currie voted in favour of the Death penalty for murder in 1983, but against it in 1994.\\n\\nIn June 1994, she contested the European Parliament UK seat of Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes, but lost the seat to Labour's Eryl McNally by 94,837 votes to 61,628 votes.\\n\\nCurrie lost her parliamentary seat in the 1997 General Election. For five years (1998–2003), she hosted a late-evening talk show on BBC Radio Five Live, Late Night Currie.\\n\\nIn 1972, Edwina Cohen married accountant Ray Currie in Barnstaple, they had two children and divorced in 1997. On 24 May 2001, in Southwark, she married retired detective John Jones whom she had met when he was a guest on her radio programme in 1999.\\n\\nCurrie is the author of six novels: A Parliamentary Affair (1994), A Woman's Place (1996) She's Leaving Home (1997), The Ambassador (1999), Chasing Men (2000) and This Honourable House (2001). She has also written four works of non-fiction: Life Lines (1989), What Women Want (1990), Three Line Quips (1992) and Diaries 1987–92 (2002), which revealed an affair with former prime minister John Major. She remains an outspoken public figure, with a reputation for being \"highly opinionated\", and currently earns her living as an author and media personality.\\n\\nFrom the time she lost her seat in 1997, Currie has maintained a presence in the media. For five years an eponymous phone-in programme ran on BBC Radio Five Live, Late Night Currie. In 2002 she moved to HTV, presenting the television programme Currie Night until 2003. Since then, she has appeared in a string of reality television programmes, such as Wife Swap, in which she and her second husband John swapped places with John McCririck and his wife, Jenny. She has also appeared in the reality cooking show Hell's Kitchen with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, and Celebrity Stars in Their Eyes, both in 2006. Currie was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series Tory! Tory! Tory!. She won Celebrity Mastermind on 23 June 2004, specialising in the life of Marie Curie. She also won All Star Family Fortunes on 3 January 2009. She also appeared in Channel 4's Come Dine With Me in February 2009 where she finished third. She made a second appearance on the show during Channel 4's \"Alternative Election Night\" coverage, with Rod Liddle, Brian Paddick and Derek Hatton as her competitors. Also, she appeared in James May's Show James May's Toy Stories where she helped him building a bridge made entirely out of Meccano in Liverpool.\\n\\nIn 2004 she took part in a sponsored cycle ride across Poland, near to the area where ancestors of hers lived, for Marie Curie Cancer Care, although Curie is not one of them.\\n\\nCurrie's Diaries (1987–92), published in 2002, caused a sensation, as they revealed a four-year affair with John Major, which began in 1984 and ended in 1988. The affair started while she was a backbencher and Major was the government whip in Margaret Thatcher's government. After Major's promotion to Chief Secretary to the Treasury the relationship ended, but the two remained friends. Currie apparently ceased the affair when it became dangerous and impractical owing to the presence of bodyguards who had to be avoided.\\n\\nMajor in a statement was \"ashamed\" of the affair, and had privately revealed the matter to his wife. However, Currie admitted to being \"in love\" with him for years afterwards, and that he was \"the love of her life\". Weeks after revealing the affair though, she publicly criticised Major, accusing him of sexism and racism, and being \"one of the less competent prime ministers\".\\n\\nIn October 1985 Currie said Sara Keays was a \"Right cow\" for writing about her affair and pregnancy with Cecil Parkinson, and for, she claimed, ruining his career. She also went on to say \"I feel very, very sorry for Cecil and his family. Most of my thoughts on Sara Keays are unprintable. \\n\\nThe admission came after years of denial of any affair while in office, a successful libel action against playwright David Hare, who had compared a sexually voracious murderer, played by Charlotte Rampling in his film Paris by Night (1988), to an \"Edwina Currie-like\" figure, and Currie's writing of several novels with raunchy themes, such as A Parliamentary Affair.\\n\\nAs part of the 2009 TV Show Ant &amp; Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, Currie teamed up with Declan Donnelly and two other celebrities to release a cover version of the Wham hit song, \"Wake Me Up (Before You Go Go)\".Her daughter, Debbie, had previously released a single.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Efferent arteriole", "body": "The efferent arterioles are blood vessel that are part of the urinary tract of organisms. The efferent arterioles form from a convergence of the capillaries of the glomerulus. They play an important role in maintaining the glomerular filtration rate despite fluctuations in blood pressure.\\n\\nIn the mammalian kidney they follow two markedly different courses, depending on the location of the glomeruli from which they arise. \\n\\nIn the mammalian kidney about 15% of glomeruli lie close to the boundary between the renal cortex and renal medulla and are known as juxtamedullary glomeruli. The rest are simply undifferentiated cortical glomeruli. \\n\\nThe efferent arterioles of the undifferentiated cortical glomeruli are the most complex. Promptly on leaving the glomerulus they break up into capillaries and become part of a rich plexus of vessels surrounding the cortical portions of the renal tubules.\\n\\nThe efferent arterioles of the juxtamedullary glomeruli are much different. They do break up, but they form bundles of vessels (arteriolae recti) that cross the outer zone of the medulla to perfuse the inner zone. \\n\\nVessels returning from the inner medulla (venulae recti) intersperse themselves in a highly regular fashion among the descending arteriolae recti to form a well organized rete mirabile. \\n\\nThis rete is responsible for the osmotic isolation of the inner medulla from the rest of the kidney and so permits the excretion of a hypertonic urine when circumstances require. Interestingly, since the rete also isolates the inner medulla from gaseous exchange, any metabolism in this area is anaerobic, and red cells, which would serve no purpose there, are ordinarily shunted from the arteriolae recti by an unknown mechanism into the capillary plexus surrounding the tubules of the outer zone of the medulla. \\n\\nBlood in this plexus and returning from the inner medulla finds its way to the renal vein and the general circulation by pathways similar to those providing drainage for the rest of the cortex.\\n\\nWhen angiotensin II levels are increased due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, most of the arteries in the body experience vasoconstriction, in order to maintain adequate blood pressure. However, this reduces blood flow to the kidneys. To compensate, the efferent arterioles constrict to a greater degree than the other arteries, in response to increased levels of angiotensin II. Pressure in glomerular capillaries is therefore maintained and glomerular filtration rate remains adequate.\\n\\nAfferent arteriole\\n\\n"}

Let  be the estimator for the parameter θ.

Generally, the variance measures the degree of dispersion of a random variable around its mean. Thus estimators with small variances are more concentrated, they estimate the parameters more precisely. We say that the estimator is finite-sample efficient estimator (in the class of unbiased estimators) if it reaches the lower bound in the Cramér–Rao inequality above, for all . Efficient estimators are always MVUE, however the opposite is not true: a minimum variance unbiased estimator may be inefficient.\\n\\nHistorically, the finite-sample efficiency was the first optimality notion introduced, and it is still sometimes encountered in old textbooks or introductory statistics courses, mainly because the Cramér–Rao inequality is easy to understand and to derive. However there are several drawbacks with this definition, which does not allow the concept of finite-sample efficiency to maintain popularity:\\n\\nAmong the models encountered in practice, efficient estimators exist for: the mean μ of the normal distribution (but not the variance σ), parameter λ of the Poisson distribution, the probability p in the binomial or multinomial distribution.\\n\\nConsider the model of a normal distribution with unknown mean but known variance:  The data consists of n iid observations from this model: .

Efford Fort (at ) was one of the ring of Victorian Palmerston's Follies built to provide defence from risk of French invasion. The area was also heavily occupied by the American army during the preparations for D-Day. This is remembered by the naming of a part of Efford, where an estate of American-supplied prefab houses was built from 1945 onwards, as Little America. Streets there were given names such as California Gardens, Oregon Way etc. These names were retained when the estate was demolished and replaced by modern houses in the 1970s.\\n\\nOne theory of the origin of the Name 'Efford' is that it originally comes from the part of this suburb that slopes down towards the river Plym (which is now partly reclaimed and built on land); before much of the river silted up, ships could Ford here when the river was at the Ebb tide; so it was the Ebbing or Ebb-Ford.

{"title": "Egerszóláti Olaszrizling", "body": "Egerszóláti Olaszrizling is one of the traditional white wines of the Eger Wine Region. It is made of the wine of the variety called Olaszrizling (outside Hungary more commonly known under its German-language name Welschriesling) and has on origin of the village Egerszólát. It is the best, when it is fermented and aged in barrel. Good or known vineyard locations are: Tóbérc, Tagi and Pipis.\\n\\nThe climate of Egerszólát is similar to that of the other parts of Eger: the annual mean temperature is 10,1 °C. Eger is among the coolest wine region of Hungary. The annual amount of rainfall is 595 mm (average of the last 40 years), while the Sun shines 2100-2200 hours a year.\\n\\nThe soil is brown forest soil with riolit tuff underneath.\\n\\nEgerszóláti Olaszrizling used to be one of the well-known Eger white wines in the Hungarian market before the communist regime. After 1945 it became a victim of the socialist farming focusing on quantity instead of quality. Attempts to re-discover this wine were made by some Eger wine-makers in the late 1990s. It is planned to award Egerszóláti Olaszrizling the DHC-status (DHC is the Hungarian AOC-system, under construction).\\n\\nNowadays Egerszóláti Olaszrizling is a quality white wine. The maximal yield can reach 95 hl/ha, though most producers follow stricter practice: their vineyards yield 15-50 hl/ha. The wine is to get the DHC status within a few years (when the Eger DHC-system will be set).\\n\\nEgerszóláti Olaszrizling is a full-bodied white wine with nice acids. It is the best when fermented and aged in oak for a few months. Bottle ageing pays off well. It is the best 2-3 years after harvest.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eight Crazy Nights", "body": "Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights is a 2002 animated musical comedy film co-written by and starring Adam Sandler. Unlike most mainstream holiday films, it is centered around Jewish characters during Hanukkah season, as opposed to religious or secular celebration of Christmas. Despite being animated in the style of television Christmas special, the film is adult oriented, featuring significant sexual and scatological humor, and focusing on such topics as alcoholism, bereavement, and depression. \\n\\nThe film's title is taken from a line in Sandler's series of songs called \"The Chanukah Song\" that compares the gift-giving traditions of Christmas and Chanukah: \"Instead of one day of presents, we get eight crazy nights!\". Additionally, a new version of The Chanukah Song was played over the film's closing credits.\\n\\nIn the small town of Dukesberry, New Hampshire in December 2001, Davey Stone (voice of and resemblance to Adam Sandler), a 33-year-old alcoholic troublemaker with a long criminal record, is arrested for walking out on his bill at Mr. Chang's (Rob Schneider) Chinese restaurant (\"Davey's Song\"). Davey is about to be sentenced to jail time when Whitey Duvall (also Sandler), a 70-year-old volunteer referee from Davey's former basketball league, comes forward at his trial. The judge (Norm Crosby), at Whitey's suggestion, sentences Davey to community service as a referee-in-training for Whitey's Youth Basketball League. Under the terms of the community service, if Davey commits a felony before his sentence is completed, he will be sentenced to at least ten years in prison.\\n\\nThe next day, Davey referees his first game, which ends in disaster. After being told to remove his shoes, Davey kicks them off, smashing an overhead lighting fixture with one and striking the timekeeper with the other. He then taunts an obese child, and later his parents, who attack Davey; Whitey suffers a grand mal seizure, and the game is abruptly brought to an end. Attempting to calm Davey down, Whitey takes him to the mall (\"At the Mall\"), where they meet single mom Jennifer Friedman (Jackie Titone, singing voice by Alison Krauss), Davey's childhood girlfriend, and her son, Benjamin (Austin Stout). Though Davey still finds himself attracted to Jennifer, Whitey reminds him that he lost his chance with her 20 years ago. \\n\\nDavey and Whitey's relationship becomes more contentious, as Whitey's various attempts to encourage Davey are met with humiliation and assault. Upon arriving home one night, Davey finds his trailer being burned down by a man who lost a bet to him; Davey rushes into the burning trailer to rescue a Hanukkah card from his parents, then watches the trailer go up in smoke. Whitey opens his home to Davey, who grudgingly accepts the invitation; also living in the house is Whitey's bald, diabetic fraternal twin sister Eleanor (also Sandler). The Duvall household has many complex rules (referred to by Whitey as technical foul), which prove themselves extremely irritating (\"Technical Foul\"). However, he seemingly overcomes them, and begins to turn his life around.\\n\\nDavey's success in reforming is cut short one morning when Whitey recalls the events of Hanukkah twenty years ago: En route to one of Davey's basketball games, his parents' car was struck by an oncoming truck after it skidded on black ice. They were both killed, and Davey learned of their deaths when the police showed up at the end of his game to inform him. Davey withdrew from society and developed alcoholism, embarking on a life of juvenile delinquency and adult criminal behavior. Davey flies into a rage and storms off; he spends the rest of the day drinking, and later that night breaks into the mall, which is closed. In a drunken stupor, he imagines the logos of various stores coming to life and confronting him about his inability to grieve for his parents, which they identify as the source of his alcoholism (\"Intervention Song\"). He finally opens his parents' Hanukkah card, which contains a message praising him for being a good son. Davey breaks down and cries, finally coming to terms with his loss. Just then the police arrive, but Davey escapes and boards a bus to New York. En route to the city, the bus is forced to stop when all eight tires are punctured by a single thumbtack in the road. Reminded of the Miracle of Hanukkah, Davey walks off the bus, intending to find Whitey and make amends. \\n\\nDavey finds Whitey at the All-Star Banquet, an annual town celebration in which one member of the community is recognized for positive contributions to Dukesberry. Despite having vied for the award for over twenty years, Whitey is once again passed over; he leaves in disgrace, intending to move to Florida, where he can live out the rest of his life in anonymity. Risking arrest, Davey storms into the hall and reminds everyone of the selfless contributions that Whitey has made to Dukesberry over the course of his life. Disgraced, the townspeople acknowledge the error of their decision (\"Bum Biddy\"). Davey leads the people to Whitey, who has gone to the mall to be alone and pray. The townspeople thank Whitey for his service over the years and the Mayor officially grants him the 2001 badge award. All 33 (one had won three) previous recipients of the award give theirs to Whitey. Davey and Jennifer reconcile, and Whitey goes into a seizure, \"the happiest seizure of my life!\". Narration informs the viewers Whitey is okay.\\n\\nThe film includes a scene/song where numerous mascots of popular businesses come to life and attempt to force Davey to confront his past. These characters include the Foot Locker referee, the KB Toys soldiers, Miss See's of See's Candies, the Victoria's Secret gown, the Panda Express panda, The Sharper Image Chair, the Radio Shack walkie talkie, the Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf cup, and a gigantic bottle labeled GNC. The following brands are seen:\\n\\nEight Crazy Nights is rated PG-13 for \"frequent crude and sexual humor, drinking, and brief drug references\".\\n\\nThe film was not well received by most critics, garnering only 13% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. It came in at fifth place on its opening weekend among U.S. box office, making only $14 million since its Wednesday launch. Despite a budget of $34 million, it only grossed a total of $23.6 million in North America and negligible foreign box office receipts, for a total of only $23.8 million worldwide before leaving theaters after nine weeks. Top film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review of 2 out of 4 possible stars stating that the film felt more like South Park crossed with Jackass.\\n\\nIn spite of the negative criticism, Sandler won a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award for Best Voice in an Animated Movie in 2003.\\n\\nEight Crazy Nights was released November 4, 2003 in 1- and 2-disc editions. The 2-disc \"special edition\" features deleted scene, several audio commentaries, Sandler's short film \"A Day with the Meatball\", among others.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eight Schools Association", "body": "The Eight Schools Association (ESA) is a group of leading American private college-preparatory schools, begun informally during the 1973-74 school year and formalized in 2006 with the appointment of a president and an executive director. ESA has a seven-school overlap of membership with the Ten Schools Admissions Organization. \\n\\nThere must be unanimous agreement among ESA schools before its membership can be expanded, and no new school has been admitted since 1974. By further institutionalizing their group in 2006, the eight member schools (in the words of Andover's newspaper The Phillipian) \"ultimately aim to forge ties in a similar fashion to the Ivy League, but with a focus on academics and other extra-curricular activities rather than just athletics.\"\\n\\nThe ESA schools are: \\n\\nArticle 1 of the ESA by-laws states that the Association was established for \"the purpose of mutual support and collegiality\" and that its main aims should be to \"address critical educational issues in order to ensure the best educational experiences and outcomes for students, explore new research and trends in education, and develop collaborative programs.\"\\n\\nAccording to a May 2009 news release from Lawrenceville School, on the occasion of Elizabeth Duffy's accession to the ESA presidency, the Association \"fosters greater interaction among administrators, faculties, students, and trustees in the form of arts and athletic events, student conferences, faculty seminars, administrative meetings, shared policies, data collection, and summer and international programs.\" \\n\\nPresident Duffy's statement was: \"We share much in common as schools and have the opportunity to exert real institutional leadership by working together on areas of mutual interest, including teaching and learning, globalization, sustainability, mentoring, student leadership, and access. There's great camaraderie among us heads, so it will be fun for me to lead this organization and work even more closely with my counterparts at the other schools.\"\\n\\nIn a May 2009 interview with the Choate student newspaper, The News, inaugural ESA president and Choate head Edward Shanahan was asked to differentiate ESA from other prep school organizations, such as the Ten Schools Admissions Organization. Shanahan mentioned \"the close relationship among the eight school members\" and said, \"We have been together for a long period of time and there's a great deal of trust and sharing.\" \\n\\nDuring the April 2008 ESA meeting at Andover, The Phillipian published a page of coverage with an introductory note headed \"A Young Ivy League.\" Its lead sentence was, \"Eight high schools are attempting to create an Ivy League of preparatory educational institutions.\" \\n\\nComparison of ESA to a fledgling Ivy League continued in a May 2010 article in Choate's The News. The writer noted that the Ivy universities had established a \"legacy of 'The Ivy League' as an educational brand name. Now eight boarding schools in the East Coast are attempting a similar — and perhaps even more ambitious — grouping.\" Choate English Department chair Cyrus Cook was, however, more circumspect, telling The News, \"The point of Eight Schools Association is not that we think we are the eight top schools in the country. It really isn't. The important thing with Eight Schools is that we think of each other as peers and learn from one another.\" \\n\\nIn August 2007, Deerfield Academy Press published the inaugural issue of an ESA literary periodical, 8 × 8. In its preface, Deerfield head Margarita Curtis went beyond the idea of \"peer schools\" to envision a \"collective.\" She wrote, \"This kind of collaboration helps recast the highly competitive and isolating nature of the prep school enterprise in terms of a common celebration of excellence in our collective student population.\"\\n\\nThe ESA began as an informal gathering of heads from seven of the Eight Schools during the 1973-74 school year. After the first meeting, an invitation was extended to Northfield Mount Hermon to join the group, which over time included participation by representatives of the eight boards of trustees. In 1996 the ESA decided to expand its once-yearly get-togethers to more regular twice-yearly meetings, one for the heads and one for the trustees. \\n\\nAt the April 2006 meeting at Lawrenceville, the group created an administrative structure: Choate head Edward Shanahan was appointed president, Lawrenceville head Elizabeth Duffy was named vice president, and former Lawrenceville chief financial officer William Bardel was hired as executive director. Administrators' tenures were set at three years. In 2009, Shanahan was succeeded by Duffy and Bardel was succeeded by former Hotchkiss head Robert \"Skip\" Mattoon.\\n\\nA group photo in The Lawrence of the 2006 participants shows Choate head Edward Shanahan, Deerfield head Eric Widmer, Deerfield head-elect Margarita Curtis, Hotchkiss head Robert Mattoon, Lawrenceville head Elizabeth Duffy, Northfield Mount Hermon head Thomas Sturtevant, Phillips Andover head Barbara Landis Chase, Phillips Exeter principal Tyler Tingley, and St. Paul's Rector William Matthews. \\n\\nIn January 2007, the aims of ESA were described in a letter sent by the school heads to their faculties. Andover head Barbara Chase's accompanying email — titled \"Association of Eight Peer Schools\" and dated January 26 — was posted in the blog of Andover's Oliver Wendell Holmes Library. Chase wrote: \"As you will see from the letter, the Association has decided to become somewhat more formally organized. We hope that the closer association will have benefits for our collective faculties and students in the years to come.\" Chase invited faculty members to contribute their suggestions. \"Ideas being discussed currently include a debate invitational, a joint literary publication, athletic play days, and a musical group jamboree. We also see advantages in collaborating on critical issues like pandemic preparedness.\"\\n\\nIn winter and spring of 2007, teachers and student-publication editors at the schools selected student writings for inclusion in the inaugural ESA publication. In August 2007, 8 × 8: Writings from the Eight School Association [sic] was published by Deerfield Academy Press (ISBN 9780975575864; colophon: \"August 2007 | Tiger Press | Northampton Massachusetts USA\"). The title page of the 208-page trade paperback lists eight sub-editors, one from each school, and general editor Andrea Moorhead of Deerfield. In the preface Deerfield head of school Margarita Curtis wrote, \"The inaugural issue of 8 × 8 ... marks an important stage in the development of an educational coalition dedicated to fostering intellectual relationships among its members. ... Let us hope that 8 × 8 will serve as a catalyst for other fruitful collaborations among our schools.\"\\n\\nOn October 13, 2007, Choate hosted the first \"Eight Schools Association Arts Meeting,\" attended by 38 teachers. Keynote speaker was Jock Reynolds, director of the Yale University Art Gallery and former director of the Addison Gallery of American Art at Andover. In April 2008 Lawrenceville hosted the first \"Eight Schools Association Jazz Festival.\"\\n\\nIn a 2008 progress report in the Choate Rosemary Hall Bulletin, ESA president Shanahan wrote: \"Under the aegis of Executive Director Robert 'Skip' Mattoon, former Head of Hotchkiss, the first anthology of student writings from the Eight Schools has been published. The first Eight Schools basketball supremacy cup tournament took place this winter, with Choate hosting the boys varsity teams, and Hotchkiss hosting the girls varsity teams. This past fall, Choate also hosted two Eight Schools events: a meeting of the Eight Schools arts departments held at the Paul Mellon Arts Center and a meeting and luncheon for Eight Schools student leaders.\"\\n\\nTwo years later in the same publication, Shanahan wrote a valedictory note after having \"passed the baton\" of the ESA presidency: \"I have been inspired by our collective efforts and demonstrated willingness for inter-school cooperation — whether it be new avenues of collaboration for introducing human rights and nonproliferation studies into the curriculum, or business management issues, or inter-school athletic tournaments. I am honored to have led this unique franchise in American education.\"\\n\\nOn March 4, 2010, The Phillipian reported that Patricia Russell, sustainability coordinator at Andover, was \"working with other members of the Eight Schools Association to establish a competition similar to the Green Cup Challenge that would begin in October.\" The Green Cup Challenge is a national high school \"green campus\" effort. \\n\\nOn April 16, 2010, the Paul Mellon Arts Center at Choate was the venue of the \"Eight Schools Play Festival\" comprising 10-minute plays performed by representatives of the member schools. This event was followed nine days later by the \"Eight Schools Theater Festival,\" again held at the Mellon Center, with the participation of six ESA schools. There were workshops in acting, singing, voice technique, technical theatre and masking, followed by a collaborative one-act play.\\n\\nOn April 20, 2010, Hotchkiss hosted an ESA \"World Languages and Cultures\" conference. Choate French teacher Katie Jewett told The News, \"Fifty-four language teachers representing six different languages met for a plenary session on how culture was being incorporated into the language education. We eventually split up by each language to discuss issues such as which resources are being used in which level of classes and how the study abroad programs are run.\"\\n\\nSince the 2006 institutionalization, annual meetings of ESA school heads, accompanied by representative trustees, have been held at Andover in April 2008, at Exeter in April 2009, and at St. Paul's in April 2010. \\n\\nChoate headmaster Shanahan told The News in May 2010, \"What first started out as an informal annual meeting for the eight heads of schools evolved into inviting trustees every year. Currently the heads bring two trustees to the annual spring meeting; the heads also meet over a dinner in [New York City] every December.\" In a May 2009 interview with The News, Shanahan said that invited speakers at the spring meeting are \"now more regular than not\" and that the April 2009 session had heard Dartmouth College president emeritus James Wright talk about the \"characteristics of enduring schools.\"\\n\\nAt the April 2008 meeting at Andover, the ESA invited representatives of the Association of Business Officers of Private Schools (ABOPS) to participate in a colloquium about the response of endowed schools to the international financial crisis. Financial officers from 21 ABOPS schools attended a session moderated by James P. Honan, a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education. Lawrenceville head Duffy explained the participation of ABOPS: \"The 40 or so business officers and CFOs who are part of ABOPS meet regularly to discuss financial matters. They've wanted to have a joint meeting with Heads for a few years. We decided to combine the two meetings since all the Eight Schools are part of ABOPS.\"\\n\\nAs reported in The Phillipian, the school heads' agenda included \"the affordability of boarding schools, faculty issues, and various environmental initiatives.\" Duffy spoke of the professional usefulness of ESA meetings, saying that her school was \"considering reintroducing a formal teaching intern program, so it was very helpful for me to hear about the other schools' programs.\" Deerfield head Margarita Curtis said that need-blind admissions continued to be an aspiration of the schools but that there were \"enormous pressures on our budget.\" William Matthews, Rector of St. Paul's, mentioned the importance of retaining the special qualities of endowed schools, including low teacher-student ratios. \"We also addressed ... making boarding school more affordable and accessible to everyone.\"\\n\\nAt the April 2009 meeting of school heads at Exeter, the main topic was again the financial climate. Choate head Edward Shanahan told The News, \"Our situations are very, very similar. Everybody's budget was being cut somewhere between 7½ and 10 [percent]. Almost everybody was talking about reduction in force, cutting back some faculty or staff, and putting on hold major capital projects. Schools chose different approaches based on decisions they ultimately had to make, but essentially our endowments are all in the same level [of percentage loss].\"\\n\\nAthletic directors of ESA schools compose the Eight Schools Athletic Council. Like their counterpart administrators, faculty, and students, they meet to share information and organize ESA sports events and tournaments. \\n\\nThe inaugural tournament of the institutionalized ESA took place on December 2, 2007, when Northfield Mount Hermon hosted the \"Eight Schools Wrestling Jamboree.\" Two weeks later Choate and Hotchkiss were venues of the boys and girls basketball \"Eight Schools Holiday Tournament,\" December 15–16. Neither event saw the full participation of all eight schools. St. Paul's hosted the \"Eight Schools Holiday Basketball Classic,\" December 18–19, 2009.\\n\\nIt will be remembered that the Ivy League began in 1945 with an agreement about football between eight college presidents and eight college athletic directors. The eight athletic directors of the ESA were coordinated by Ned Gallagher of Choate for ten years ending in 2008. His blog As Far As You Know includes a record of the creative process of a nascent ESA sports league. Some extracts: \\n\\nMay 13, 2008: \"The gathering of the athletic directors of the Eight Schools ... took place up at Deerfield today. This meeting has the feel of a council of barons or something like that. It's a good group to meet with, as we share many of the same challenges and issues on each of our campuses. Having coordinated the work of this assemblage for the past decade, I am happily passing the leadership baton on to others, as we created a rotation of each member school taking a turn hosting meetings and acting as point person for the group of colleagues.\"\\n\\nMay 3, 2009, morning: \"I am driving down to New Jersey this afternoon for a gathering of the Eight Schools Athletic Council. We have dinner and some meetings scheduled for tonight on the Lawrenceville School campus and then we'll huddle first thing in the morning with athletic administrators at Princeton University. \\n\\nMay 3, 2009, night: Our group of athletic directors ... ate dinner together and met for a couple of hours this evening, working our way through an agenda of business items. But the best part of our time together is the informal time in a local tavern after the official meetings have ended. That's when the free-wheeling discussions about what's going on in our schools are most useful. It's also when we cement our relationships so that we can deal with each other on the basis of trust in the course of our regular interactions.\" \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eight Worlds", "body": "Eight Worlds refers to a series of novels and short stories by John Varley, in which the solar system has been colonized by human refugees fleeing an alien invasion of the Earth. Earth and Jupiter are off-limits to humanity, but Earth's moon and the other worlds and moons of the solar system have all become heavily populated. There are also minor colonies set in the Oort cloud beyond the solar system itself. Faster Than Light travel is not (as yet) possible, though it's mentioned that test-flights will begin soon at the end of \"The Golden Globe\", and the species has not as yet managed to extend itself to other stars. \\n\\nThe series mostly deals with the ways in which technology and necessity shape morality and society. Instant sex changes are considered a matter of fashion, rather than gender-identity, and many long-standing human sexual taboos no longer exist. Thus the stories are somewhat disturbing to some readers, and maintain a degree of controversy.\\n\\nThe \"Eight Worlds\" story \"Overdrawn at the Memory Bank\" (first published in 1976) was adapted into a TV movie in 1985, starring Raul Julia.\\n\\nThe stories were written at different times and are not always consistent with each other. In particular, the novels \"Steel Beach\" and \"The Golden Globe\" seem to revise large portions of the original history (see Consistency, below). Varley has written that the Eight Worlds background should be regarded as a group of common characters and situations that appear in different stories rather than a single consistent setting. Several of the stories feature common characters, and these may be seen as linking together the whole series.\\n\\nJohn Varley has indicated that these so-called \"Pre-invasion\" stories are not actually a part of the \"Eight Worlds\" universe, even though they are commonly mistaken to be, and are occasionally bundled with real Eight Worlds stories in anthologies. They have a completely different history, in which there is lunar colonization (a common theme in Varley stories) and open sexuality (likewise a common theme), but there are no aliens and a great deal of Nuclear Terrorism on earth. None of the characters or locations in these stories has ever turned up in the Eight Worlds sequence as yet (outside of mentions in \"Steel Beach\" - see Consistency), though, on one occasion, Varley indicated that he might end up tying the two together in the as-yet-unfinished \"Irontown Blues,\" presumably the final novel in the \"Steel Beach\" trilogy set within the Eight Worlds universe.\\n\\nThe first Anna Louise Bach story is the short story \"Bagatelle\" concerning a nuclear device planted in an underground lunar colony. At this time, Earth is still home to a technological civilization, albeit one which has to deal with nuclear terrorism. Bach is the Chief of Police in Luna City. Later stories such as \"The Barbie Murders\", and \"Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo\" deal with Bach in the earlier stages of her career. The novelette \"Blue Champagne\" has Bach as a minor character, working as a lifeguard in \"The Bubble\", a giant globe of water held in zero-gravity conditions on a resort satellite for the enjoyment of rich tourists. At the end of that story she announces that she has been saving her money to return to Luna and enroll in the Police Academy. A major character in the same story is Megan Gallagher, a \"media star\".\\n\\nIn notes contained within \"The John Varley Reader\", the author explains that he created Anna Louise Bach for stories which were too grim for the relative Utopia of the Eight Worlds series. He never intended that her story link to the Eight Worlds chronology. In fact, even within the Anna Louise Bach stories there are inconsistencies, such as the appearance of the fabulous \"Mozartplatz\" in \"Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo\", where a huge chasm on Luna is roofed over producing cubic miles of pressurized space featuring aerial communities, artificial rivers etc. The other stories portray Luna society as living in cramped tunnels.\\n\\nMegan Gallagher first appears in \"Blue Champagne\" and then in \"Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo\", linking her with Anna Louise Bach in both. In \"Blue Champagne\" she is a \"trans-sister\", a quadraplegic who leads a celebrity lifestyle with the aid of a sophisticated device which enfolds her entire body in a net of golden alloy threads, which move her limbs for her. The device also records sights, sounds and emotions as she experiences them. These are then sold as virtual reality experiences, known as feelies, for an audience of vicarious thrill-seekers. In \"Steel Beach\" she is also mentioned as one of the \"Gigastars\" enshrined by the Flacks - a bizarre celebrity cult - who later regret this choice, when feelies go out of fashion. In \"Tango Charlie\" she has shed the device, undergone surgery to restore her nervous system, and uses her money and influence to help Anna Louise Bach with her stuttering career and her current case. She mysteriously disappeared 100 years before the action of \"Steel Beach\".\\n\\nCharacters with these names appear in \"The Phantom of Kansas\", \"Picnic on Nearside\" and \"Steel Beach\". It is by no means clear that they are the same people. Fox encounters her own clone in \"Phantom\", illegally made in a strange form of kidnapping. They discover a mutual affection and leave Luna as a couple for somewhere with less restrictive laws.\\n\\nCathay, a Teacher, appears in the short story \"Beatnik Bayou\" and \"The Ophiuchi Hotline\". His job entails working exclusively with one child for a period of his or her early life. In \"Beatnik Bayou\" he actually regresses physically to the age of the child and grows up at the same rate, keeping his adult mentality, but an incident results in him being professionally disgraced. In \"The Ophiuchi Hotline\" he is cloned illegally by the character \"Boss Tweed\", so that two of him are major characters in that novel.\\n\\nA journalist who was originally named Maria , but took a new name from The Front Page. Hildy is the central character in Steel Beach and has appeared as a minor character in other works.\\n\\nActor and con-man. The main character of The Golden Globe.\\n\\nDescribed at length in The Ophiuchi Hotline the Invaders are inhabitants of gas-giant planets like Jupiter. They transcend the limits of four-dimensional spacetime and can manipulate time and space at will. They classify living beings in one of three categories: those such as themselves, who arise in gas giant planets everywhere, cetacean such as dolphins and whales, and vermin, the last category including all sentient beings other than Invaders and cetaceans. The Invasion of Earth was carried out to protect cetaceans from the effects of human civilization. No humans were directly killed, but instead billions died as the Invaders dismantled all the infrastructure needed to support billions of people on Earth. The human population of Earth, after the Invasion, is about the same as in prehistory, living in tribes without access to technology. This is a scenario that has been played out for millions of years across the galaxy. Inevitably the human species will be forced out of the Solar System altogether, to live between the stars where other displaced intelligences are already in residence.\\n\\nApparently a settlement on the far side of Luna from Earth, it features in several stories, including \"Options\", a story about the early days when people can change sex at will. In \"Picnic on Nearside\" two adolescents leave King City to explore the old cities on the other side of Luna, from which Earth can be seen all the time. These were abandoned after the Invasion, as people did not like to look at what they had lost.\\n\\nHumans possess several advanced technologies, many supposedly derived from information contained in the \"Ophiuchi Hotline\", a stream of data travelling on a laser beam, apparently from the star 70 Ophiuchi. The novel Steel Beach describes new technologies (the \"null field\" and a \"FTL propulsion system\") that are attributed to \"Valentine Michael Smith\", — (the \"leader\" of a group of idealists known as the \"Heinlein\") — a pseudonym which is obviously a homage to the renowned author of Stranger in a Strange Land.\\n\\nA variant on the \"force field\" idea, the nullfield can wrap any object or volume in a shell which cannot be penetrated by anything, except gravity and certain kinds of light. Worn like a second skin it is the ultimate spacesuit. It can also be a domed tent for life on the surface of Luna, Mercury or Venus. To someone outside, a nullfield looks like a perfect mirror in the shape of whatever it contains. In the stories, people in nullfield suits survive falling into Jupiter, skimming the outer atmosphere of the Sun, walking on the surface of Venus, and being buried alive on Mercury (though the kinetic energy of being shot can cause fatal heat buildup). Two nullfields can merge, allowing people wearing them to touch each other, making for a way of passing the time when buried alive, waiting to be rescued. A nullfield can also be used as a doorway between pressurized quarters and vacuum. A person with a personal suit generator can walk through the nullfield doorway from air to vacuum, and their suit will form automatically.\\n\\nUsually called \"Symbs\", these are a semi-living material which can supply all the needs of a human body, requiring only sunlight and some trace elements. A Symb will enfold and penetrate the body of someone who wants to enter into symbiosis with it, forming a Symb Pair. One of the side effects is that the Symb forms a personality of its own in the brain of the human. It also vastly increases the efficiency of the brain, and enhances artistic abilities. Almost all Symb Pairs live in the rings of Saturn, trading artworks for their few material needs.\\n\\nOddly the creators of the Hotline data seem to know a lot about genetics. Humans in the Eight Worlds use this information to create new animal and plant species, but manipulating human DNA is illegal. This is an important plot point in the final episode of the series \"The Ophiuchi Hotline\". Minor modifications of the body are routine, such as the addition of gills for underwater breathing (\"Goodbye, Robinson Crusoe\") or decorative alterations, such as growing fur on various parts of the body.\\n\\nUsing a fictional chemical called ferrophotonucleic acid, or FPNA, the state of a person's brain can be preserved in long molecular chains, and replayed into a new brain. This is used for two purposes. \\n\\nFirst, people can record their personalities and all their memories into storage, along with a sample of their tissue. If they die, a copy can be cloned and returned to life with the memories they had up to the time of recording. This is a plot point in \"The Phantom of Kansas\" where the character Fox awakes, to find she is a clone who has been revived after her original self, and the subsequent clone, were both mysteriously murdered. In \"The Ophiuchi Hotline\" the character Lilo is cloned several times by the politician Boss Tweed to carry out missions for him, as are several other characters. The law also provides for a sentence of \"Death with immediate reprieve\" where a criminal is killed and a clone is revived with memories from before the commission of the crime. The \"innocent\" copy has to undergo therapy to avoid a repeat of the criminal act. This sentence can even be applied to simple assault, as in \"Beatnik Bayou\", if the crime is severe enough.\\n\\nThe other use is a kind of tourism where the personality can be transferred into some other brain to absorb some experience, followed by re-playing that into the original brain. In the story \"Overdrawn at the Memory Bank\" a man's personality is recorded and placed in the brain of a lioness in one of the wildlife reserves on Luna. Unfortunately his body goes missing, and he spends a long time in the computer network, keeping his \"new\" memories alive. In the process he goes to virtual university and also threatens the financial stability of the society when he starts tinkering. After what seems like months to him, he is reunited with his body and finds that only a few hours have passed.\\n\\nIn the Author's Note of \"Steel Beach\", Varley states:  While there are small details throughout the series which do not match up, this is especially true of \"Steel Beach\" and its sequel. Any plot/character descriptions in this article should be read with this in mind.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eights on pylons", "body": "thumbEights on Pylons or Pylon Eights, is a ground reference maneuver where an aircraft isflown in a figure eight pattern around two selected points on the ground (the pylons).However, Eights on Pylons differs from similar maneuvers such as Eights Along a Road, Eights Across a Road, or Eights Around Pylons in that the objective of Eights on Pylons is not to maintain a specific altitude and ground track, but rather to fly the airplane so that the pylon remains fixed in place when viewed from the cockpit along a line parallel to the lateral axis of the aircraft. This is only possible when the aircraft is flown at the pivotal altitude corresponding to the current groundspeed.If the aircraft is flying in wind, the groundspeed will vary throughout the maneuver and thusthe pivotal altitude will change also. However, the pivotal altitude varies only with the ground speed and not with the radius of turn or the angle of bank. So whether the maneuveris flown very close to the pylon with the aircraft banked 60 degrees, or farther from the pylonat 30 degrees bank, the necessary altitude is the same.\\n\\nIn the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration requires pilots to demonstrateEights on Pylons to obtain a Commercial Pilot License.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eiji Yoshikawa", "body": " was a Japanese historical novel, probably one of the best and most famous authors in the genre. Among his most well-known novels, most are revisions of past works. He was mainly influenced by classics such as The Tale of the Heike, Tale of Genji, Outlaws of the Marsh, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, many of which he retold later in his life. For instance, the original manuscript of Taiko is about 15 volumes, so Yoshikawa took up the job to retell it in close and accessible language. His other books also serve similar purposes and, although most of his novels aren't original, he created a huge amount of work and renewed interest in the past. He was awarded the Cultural Order of Merit in 1960 (the highest award for a man of letters), the Order of the Sacred Treasure and the Mainichi Art Award just before his death of cancer in 1962. He is cited as one of the best historical novelists in Japan.\\n\\nHe was born  in Kanagawa Prefecture, in what is now a part of Yokohama. Because of his father's failed business, he had to drop out of primary school to work when he was 11 years old. When he was 18, after a near-fatal accident working at the Yokohama docks, he moved to Tokyo and became an apprentice in a gold lacquer workshop. Around this time he became interested in comic haiku. He joined a poetry society and started writing comic haiku under the pseudonym \"Kijiro.\"\\n\\nIn 1914, with The Tale of Enoshima, he won first prize in a novel-writing contest sponsored by the publisher Kodansha. He joined the newspaper Maiyu Shimbun in 1921, and in the following year he began publishing serializations, starting with Life of Shinran.\\n\\nHe married Yasu Akazawa in 1923, the year of the Great Kantō earthquake. His experiences in the earthquake strengthened his resolve to make writing his career. In the following years he published stories in various periodicals published by Kodansha, who recognized him as their number one author. He used 19 pen names before settling on Eiji Yoshikawa. He first used this pen name with the serialization of Sword Trouble, Woman Trouble. His name became a household word after Secret Record of Naruto was serialized in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun. From then on the public's appetite for his brand of adventure writing was insatiable.\\n\\nIn the early 1930s, his writing became introspective, reflecting growing troubles in his personal life. But in 1935, with the serialization of Musashi, about famed swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, in the Asahi Shimbun, his writing settled firmly into the genre of historical adventure fiction.\\n\\nUpon the outbreak of war with China in 1937 the Asahi Shimbun sent him into the field as a special correspondent. At this time he divorced Yasu Akazawa and married Fumiko Ikedo. During the war he continued writing novels, and became more influenced by Chinese culture. Among the works of this period are Taiko and his re-telling of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\\n\\nAt the end of the war he stopped writing and settled down to a quiet retirement in Yoshino (present-day Oumeshi) on the outskirts of Tokyo, but he soon started writing again in 1947. His post-war works include New Tale of the Heike, published in the Asahi Weekly (1950), and A Private Record of the Pacific War (1958).\\n\\nFour of his books have been translated into English. They are:\\n\\nThe Japanese publisher Kodansha currently publishes an 80-volume series: Yoshikawa Eiji Rekishi Jidai Bunko, or Eiji Yoshikawa's Historical Fiction in Paperback.

After his father died in 1634, Ejei Khan and his mother were surrounded by over ten thousand Jurchen cavalries in a surprise attack in February, 1635. Weighing their options, Ejei and his mother decided to surrender and gave the great seal of the Yuan Khagan to Hong Taiji and the title of Grand Khan passed to the Manchu Emperors, who founded the Qing Dynasty. Ejei then followed the Manchu court's order to ask the remnants of the Mongol clan still fighting the Manchu to lay down their arms and surrender, and he did so successfully. In March, 1636, all resistance ceased and Mongol chieftains from a total of sixteen clans and forty-nine subclans gathered at the Manch capital, gave their allegiance to Hong Taiji, officially marking the end of the rule of the Borjigin clan. For his contribution, Ejei was awarded the rank of Dear Prince (Qin Wang, 亲王), a title he held until his death in 1661, and inherited by his younger brother Abunai (阿布奈).\\n\\nAbunai (阿布奈) openly showed his discontent toward the Manchu and he was put under house arrest in Shenyang by the Kangxi Emperor in 1669 and his imperial title / rank was given to his son Borni (布尔尼) in September of that same year. Borni (布尔尼) was careful to not show any sign of disrespecting the Qing Dynasty, but finally in 1675, he suddenly rebelled along with his younger brother Lubuzung (罗布藏), capitalizing on the Revolt of the Three Feudatories. However, they had made a serious miscalculation in wrongfully believing that other Mongols would join them, when in reality only three thousand Chahar (Mongols) joined the rebellion. It only took a single decisive battle on April 20, 1675 to defeat Abunai (阿布奈) and his followers, who were all killed subsequently in their retreat. The Qing Dynasty's punishment of the rebellion was very harsh: all royal males of Chahar (Mongols) were executed, including infants born to Qing / Manchu princesses, and all royal females of Chahar (Mongols) were sold to slavery except these Qing / Manchu princesses. \\n\\n"}

This law included the various collective state media under a unified management, the majority of which returned to private ownership following the departure of the military regime from power.\\n\\nEl Peruano was first published in Lima on October 22, 1825 under the name El Peruano Independiente, an \"official\" newspaper established by Simón Bolívar, who ordered Tomás de Heres to publish a publication supporting his presence in Peru. In May 1826, the Ministry of Government declared the publication official and ordered that notices and documents relating to the civil service be inserted in it. Its name was changed to simply El Peruano on May 13 of that year. The cleric Lucas Pellicer was the first editor after the officialization of the publication.\\n\\nThe Gazette began publishing laws on November 15, 1826 because the newspaper El Registro Oficial, which was published for that purpose, was published irregularly. Over time El Registro Oficial lost its importance compared to El Peruano.\\n\\nEl Peruano underwent a series of name changes. It was called La Prensa Peruana under the leadership of José Joaquín de Larriva (1828-1829), El Conciliador under the leadership of Felipe Pardo y Aliaga (1830-1834). It was also called El Redactor Peruano (1834-1836 and 1838), La Gaceta de Gobierno (1835), El Eco del Protectorado (1836-1839), and in Lima El Eco del Norte (1837-1838).\\n\\n"}

{"title": "El Santuario de Chimayo", "body": "El Santuario de Chimayó is a Roman Catholic church in Chimayó, New Mexico, USA. This santuario (Spanish for \"sanctuary\"), a National Historic Landmark, is famous for the story of its founding and as a contemporary pilgrimage site. It receives almost 300,000 visitors per year and has been called \"no doubt the most important Catholic pilgrimage center in the United States.\"\\n\\nthumbThe Santuario is on Juan Medina Drive in Chimayó. It is entered through a walled courtyard. Built of adobe with a bell tower on each side, the church is  long and  wide with walls more than 3 feet (about 1 m) thick. Pointed caps on the towers and a metal pitched roof (blocking the clerestory) were added after 1917, probably in the 1920s. The \"elegant\" doors were carved by the 19th-century carpenter Pedro Domínguez. An unusual feature is two side-by-side rooms at the entrance forming a vestibule or narthex, once used for storage. The nave contains a crucifix by the santero \"Molleno\" (fl. 1800–1850) representing Christ of Esquipulas,  tall. Other notable folk-art decorations include five reredos and a small sculpture of St. James the Great. A small room called el pocito (the little well) contains a round pit, the source of \"holy dirt\" (tierra bendita) that is believed to have healing powers. An adjacent Prayer Room displays many ex-voto as well as photographs, discarded crutches, and other testimonials of those purportedly healed.\\n\\nIn the early 19th Century, nineteen families lived in what was then called El Potrero de Chimayó (potrero means pasture). The land where the Santuario now stands belonged to Don Bernardo Abeyta, one of the first members of Los Hermanos de la Fraternidad Piadosa de Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno (the Penitentes) in the area. Also, he was probably devoted to the Christ of Esquipulas, a pilgrimage site in Guatemala where the clay is ascribed healing power. A nephew of Don Bernardo was christened Juan de Esquipulas in 1805.\\n\\nFernando Abeyta built a small chapel to the Christ of Esquipulas on the present site around 1810. On November 15, 1813, he wrote to Father Sebastián Álvarez, the parish priest of Santa Cruz de la Cañada, asking him to write to the Episcopal See of Durango for permission to build a bigger church in which the people of El Potrero could worship Jesus as he appeared at Esquipulas and could hear Mass. The next day, Fr. Álvarez wrote the letter, mentioning that cures were reported and many pilgrims were arriving. On February 8, 1814, Francisco Fernández Valentín, Vicar General of the Diocese of Durango, wrote back with permission. By 1816 the chapel was replaced by the present church.\\n\\nAbeyta's daughter, Carmen Abeyta de Chaves, inherited the property and kept it despite an attempt to force her to give it to the Church; a major source of her income was donations from pilgrims. Her daughter, María de los Ángeles Chaves, inherited it in turn and was the owner as of 1915. In 1929, when the owners were in financial trouble, members of the newly formed Spanish Colonial Arts Society bought the property and donated it to the Archdiocese of Santa Fe.\\n\\nMany visitors to the church take a small amount of the \"holy dirt\", often in hopes of a miraculous cure for themselves or someone who could not make the trip. Formerly, at least, they often ate the dirt. (Likewise pilgrims to the original shrine of Esquipulas eat the supposedly curative clay found there.) Now seekers of cures more commonly rub themselves with the dirt or simply keep it. The Church replaces the dirt in the pocito from the nearby hillsides, sometimes more than once a day, for a total of about 25 or 30 tons a year.\\n\\nThe Church takes no position on whether miracle have occurred at the Santuario.\\n\\nEach year some 30,000 people from all over the world make pilgrimages to the Santuario de Chimayó during Holy Week, especially on Holy Thursday and Good Friday, some seeking blessings and some in fulfillment of a vow. Walking is traditional; some pilgrims walk from as far away as Albuquerque, about 90 miles (150 km).\\n\\nThe feast of St. James the Great (Santiago) is celebrated on the fourth weekend of July with, among other events, a traditional play.\\n\\nEl Santuario de Chimayó was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.\\n\\nSome say that before the Spaniards arrived, a hot spring that then flowed near the site was sacred to the Tewa Indians for its healing powers.\\n\\nOne version of the legend says that during Holy Week, Abeyta (or a friar) saw a light shining from the hillside and dug the crucifix up with his bare hands. He turned it over to Fr. Álvarez, who took it to the Chimayó church, but the crucifix mysteriously returned to the spot where Abeyta found it. After the third time this happened, Álvarez and Abeyta decided to build a chapel on the spot to house the crucifix.\\n\\nAnother version says Abeyta was watching his sheep and contemplating his blessings, though he was sick, when a vision of his patron saint, San Esquipula [sic], beckoned to him. He went to the place where the saint had appeared and knelt; he was cured immediately. Other people also were cured there, and Abeyta built the chapel in thanks.\\n\\nA third version says that the crucifix had belonged to a priest from Esquipulas who accompanied the first Spanish settlers in Chimayó. He was killed by Indians and buried in Chimayó. A flood of the Santa Cruz River (a small tributary of the Rio Grande) in the spring of 1810 uncovered the body and the crucifix. People who remembered the priest dedicated the shrine to the Christ of Esquipulas.\\n\\n"}

It was originally a side product of the development for thermo-pneumatic locomotive, but unlike the trains, it was a big success.\\n\\nThe function principle is targeted for longest lifetime and minimized maintenance, resulting in full steel design and highest manufacturing quality. It connects the engine with the driven unit, transmits the torque, allows misalignments between the shafts, moves resonance and dampens vibration.\\n\\nThe coupling primarily consists of three main parts:\\n\\nElastic Steel Spring CouplingThe whole coupling is filled with pressurized oil, which is responsible for lubrication, damping and cooling. The oil is generally supplied from the engine via a drilling in the crankshaft.\\n\\nThe primary part is mounted to the drive side, the secondary section is connected with the driven side. Between these, the steel spring packs are mounted, the outer end to the primary section, the inner side is guided in groovings in secondary part. In case of torque irregularities caused by misfireings in the engine or vibrations caused from a propeller (in ship applications), a relative movement between inner and outer part occurs. This movement leads to an elastic deformation of the leaf springs, which push oil from one chamber to the other. This causes hydraulic friction and thus is responsible for damping the vibrations. The damping can be adjusted independently from the stiffness via the damping gaps.\\n\\nAdvantages:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elastic scoring", "body": "Elastic scoring is a style of orchestration or music arrangement that was first used by the Australian composer Percy Grainger.\\n\\nThis unique technique of orchestration is used to provide composer with the option of allowing a diverse group of voices or instrumentalist the ability to perform their music. An example of this is when a composer or arranger provides extra sheet music parts so a flute quartet (four flutes) can play the same piece as a group comprising two flutes, alto flute and bass flute, resulting a choir-like sound. In other words, a subtle re-engineering of the original work.\\n\\nThis technique involves making extra and/or interchangeable musical parts which provide substitutions for more or less musicians depending on what is required for an individual performance. This also allows a musical work to be played in smaller communities where the required instruments may not always be available.\\n\\nOne of the main tenets of elastic scoring is that the new arrangement preserve as much as possible the original interval relationship (to the closest octave) between notes while not being overly concerned with tone colour or number of instruments. Timbre is the aspect of music varied most through changing timbre or number of instruments.\\n\\nBesides providing alternative instrumentation in the form of sheet music parts, the elastic scoring concept allows three subsets of scoring music. The Canadian composer Daniel Theaker describes these subsets as lateral, expansion and contraction scoring.\\n\\nLateral scoring can be said to have occurred when a piece of music is set for one or more instruments from the original number of instruments. An example of this is if a piece of music set for flute and piano is re-scored for clarinet and piano. In this instance, the intervallic relationships remain the same, but the tone colour has changed.\\n\\nExpansion scoring is a style of arranging or orchestration that lets composers and arrangers enlarge the original work from a smaller score to a larger one. An example of this is when a string quartet is expanded to become a piece for string orchestra.\\n\\nContraction scoring lets composers and arrangers reduce the original work from a larger score to a smaller score, such as when an orchestral work is reduced to piano part. The resulting piano score is more commonly known as a 'Piano reduction'.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elazar Rokeach", "body": "Eleazar Rokeach (c. 1176 – 1238), also known as Eleazar of Worms or Eleazar ben Judah ben Kalonymus, was a leading Talmudist and kabbalist, and the last major member of the Chassidei Ashkenaz, a group of German Jewish pietist. \\n\\nEleazar was probably born in Mainz. He was a descendant of the great Kalonymus family of Mainz, and a disciple of Judah he-Hasid, who initiated him into the study of the Kabbala, at that time little known in Germany. According to Zunz, Eleazar was chazzan at Erfurt before he became rabbi at Worms. He was a signatory to the Takkanot Shum. Eleazar underwent great sufferings during the Crusades. On the night of 22 Kislev, 1196, he was engaged on his commentary on Genesis (he relates that he had reached the parshah Vayeshev), when two crusaders entered his house and killed his wife Dulcina, his two daughters Belat and Hannah, and his son Jacob. His wife had conducted a business in parchment scrolls in order to support the family and enable him to devote all his time to study. Many of the piyyutim he authored protest at Israel's suffering and hope for redemption and revenge against her tormentors. \\n\\nEleazar developed a vigorous activity in many directions. On the one hand, he was a Talmudist of vast erudition, a liturgist gifted with a clear and easy style, and an astronomer, and was well versed in the sciences open to the Jews of Germany at that time. At the same time, he was an adventurous kabbalist who experienced visions, seeing legions of angels and demons. He exerted himself to spread kabbalistic systems which went far beyond the conceptions of the classical authors of the Kabbala. In his kabbalistic works he developed and gave a new impulse to the mysticism associated with the letters of the alphabet. The philosophical Kabbala of the school of Isaac the Blind is replaced by arithmetical speculations. By the gematria and notarikon systems of interpretation found in the Talmud, Eleazar invented new combinations by which miracles could be performed. The haggadic anthropomorphism which he had combated in his earlier works (Ha-Roḳeaḥ, Sha'are ha-Sod weha-Yiḥud) occupied later the foremost place in his kabbalistic writings.Eleazar's great merit therefore lies not in his new kabbalistic system, but in his ethical works. In these he shows greatness of soul and a piety bordering upon asceticism. Though so severely tried by fate, he inculcates cheerfulness, patience, and love for humanity. He died at Worms in 1238.\\n\\nIn addition to these works, Eleazar wrote tosafot to many Talmudical treatises, referred to by Bezalel Ashkenazi in his Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet; a commentary on \"Sheḳalim\" in the Palestinian recension, cited by Asheri in his commentary to that treatise in the Babylonian Talmud; thirty-six chapters on the examination of slaughtered animals (MS. Michael No. 307). Zunz enumerates fifty-five liturgical poems and dirges composed by Eleazar and occurring in the Ashkenazic maḥzorim, ḳinot, and seliḥot.\\n\\n \\n\\n"}

In 1805, a small hut was built at Elderslie near the ford on the Nepean River to house two constable assigned to keep an eye on the cattle. This was the first house built by British settlers in the Camden region. Later the same year, wool pioneer John Macarthur was granted 5,000 acres (20 km²) at Cowpastures.

Their one MEP, leader Waldemar Tomaszewski, sits with the European Conservatives and Reformists, which includes the Polish Law and Justice.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 1994 the law on social organisations was adopted. According to this law, social organisations had to transform into political parties or simply remain social organizations. Till that time the Association of Poles in Lithuania (APL) was a public-political organisation. Thus it had the option to act both in social and political spheres. The Polish community which did not have its own party faced the difficult task of keeping the Association and simultaneously enabling its participation in the political life of Lithuania at the same time. The appointment of the party required a lot of organizational effort. In this situation the central administration of the APL convened 5th Extraordinary Conference of APL on 14th August. During the Conference the decision was adopted to transform the APL into a social organisation and support the efforts of the group initiating the establishment of a party set up under the name of the Electoral Action of the APL. Finally, on 23rd October after the pressure from the Lithuanian Ministry of Justice to remove the word ‘Union’ from the name of the party, it was registered as the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania (EAPL).

{"title": "Electric arc furnace", "body": "right\\n\\nIn the 19th century, a number of men had employed an electric arc to melt iron. Sir Humphry Davy conducted an experimental demonstration in 1810; welding was investigated by Pepys in 1815; Pinchon attempted to create an electrothermic furnace in 1853; and, in 1878–79, Sir William Siemens took out patent for electric furnaces of the arc type.\\n\\nThe first electric arc furnaces were developed by Paul Héroult, of France, with a commercial plant established in the United States in 1907. The Sanderson brothers formed The Sanderson Brothers steel Co. in Syracuse, New York, installing the first electric arc furnace in the U.S. This furnace is now on display at Station Square, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\\n\\nInitially \"electric steel\" was a specialty product for such uses as machine tool and spring steel. Arc furnaces were also used to prepare calcium carbide for use in carbide lamp. The Stessano electric furnace is an arc type furnace that usually rotates to mix the bath. The Girod furnace is similar to the Héroult furnace.\\n\\nWhile EAFs were widely used in World War II for production of alloy steels, it was only later that electric steelmaking began to expand. The low capital cost for a mini-mill—around US$140–200 per ton of annual installed capacity, compared with US$1,000 per ton of annual installed capacity for an integrated steel mill—allowed mills to be quickly established in war-ravaged Europe, and also allowed them to successfully compete with the big United States steelmakers, such as Bethlehem Steel and U.S. Steel, for low-cost, carbon steel \"long products\" (structural steel, rod and bar, wire, and fastener) in the U.S. market.\\n\\nWhen Nucor—now one of the largest steel producers in the U.S.—decided to enter the long products market in 1969, they chose to start up a mini-mill, with an EAF as its steelmaking furnace, soon followed by other manufacturers. Whilst Nucor expanded rapidly in the Eastern US, the companies that followed them into mini-mill operations concentrated on local markets for long products, where the use of an EAF allowed the plants to vary production according to local demand. This pattern was also followed globally, with EAF steel production primarily used for long products, while integrated mills, using blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace, cornered the markets for \"flat products\"—sheet steel and heavier steel plate. In 1987, Nucor made the decision to expand into the flat products market, still using the EAF production method.\\n\\nthumbAn electric arc furnace used for steelmaking consists of a refractory-lined vessel, usually water-cooled in larger sizes, covered with a retractable roof, and through which one or more graphite electrode enter the furnace. The furnace is primarily split into three sections:\\n\\nThe hearth may be hemispherical in shape, or in an eccentric bottom tapping furnace (see below), the hearth has the shape of a halved egg. In modern meltshops, the furnace is often raised off the ground floor, so that ladles and slag pots can easily be maneuvered under either end of the furnace. Separate from the furnace structure is the electrode support and electrical system, and the tilting platform on which the furnace rests. Two configurations are possible: the electrode supports and the roof tilt with the furnace, or are fixed to the raised platform.\\n\\nA typical alternating current furnace has three electrodes. Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric winch hoists or hydraulic cylinder. The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The mast arms holding the electrodes carry heavy busbar, which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the electrode holders. Modern systems use \"hot arms\", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency. These can be made from copper-clad steel or aluminium. Since the electrodes move up and down automatically for regulation of the arc, and are raised to allow removal of the furnace roof, heavy water-cooled cable connect the bus tubes/arms with the transformer located adjacent to the furnace. To protect the transformer from heat, it is installed in a vault.\\n\\nThe furnace is built on a tilting platform so that the liquid steel can be poured into another vessel for transport. The operation of tilting the furnace to pour molten steel is called \"tapping\". Originally, all steelmaking furnaces had a tapping spout closed with refractory that washed out when the furnace was tilted, but often modern furnaces have an eccentric bottom tap-hole (EBT) to reduce inclusion of nitrogen and slag in the liquid steel. These furnaces have a taphole that passes vertically through the hearth and shell, and is set off-centre in the narrow \"nose\" of the egg-shaped hearth. It is filled with refractory sand, such as olivine, when it is closed off. Modern plants may have two shells with a single set of electrodes that can be transferred between the two; one shell preheats scrap while the other shell is utilised for meltdown. Other DC-based furnaces have a similar arrangement, but have electrodes for each shell and one set of electronics.\\n\\nAC furnaces usually exhibit a pattern of hot and cold-spots around the hearth perimeter, with the cold-spots located between the electrodes. Modern furnaces mount oxygen-fuel burners in the sidewall and use them to provide chemical energy to the cold-spots, making the heating of the steel more uniform. Additional chemical energy is provided by injecting oxygen and carbon into the furnace; historically this was done through lances in the slag door, now this is mainly done through multiple wall-mounted injection units.\\n\\nA mid-sized modern steelmaking furnace would have a transformer rated about 60,000,000 volt-amperes (60 MVA), with a secondary voltage between 400 and 900 volts and a secondary current in excess of 44,000 amperes. In a modern shop such a furnace would be expected to produce a quantity of 80 metric tonnes of liquid steel in approximately 60 minutes from charging with cold scrap to tapping the furnace. In comparison, basic oxygen furnace can have a capacity of 150–300 tonnes per batch, or \"heat\", and can produce a heat in 30–40 minutes. Enormous variations exist in furnace design details and operation, depending on the end product and local conditions, as well as ongoing research to improve furnace efficiency—the largest scrap-only furnace (in terms of tapping weight and transformer rating) is in Turkey, with a tap weight of 300 metric tonnes and a transformer of 300 MVA.\\n\\nTo produce a ton of steel in an electric arc furnace requires approximately 400 kilowatt-hour per short ton of electricity, or about 440 kWh per metric tonne; the theoretical minimum amount of energy required to melt a tonne of scrap steel is 300 kWh (melting point 1520°C/2768°F). Therefore, the 300-tonne, 300 MVA EAF mentioned above will require approximately 132 MWh of energy to melt the steel, and a \"power-on time\" (the time that steel is being melted with an arc) of approximately 37 minutes, allowing for the power factor. Electric arc steelmaking is only economical where there is plentiful electricity, with a well-developed electrical grid. In many locations, mills operate during off-peak hours when utilities have surplus power generating capacity.\\n\\nright\\n\\nThe use of EAFs allows steel to be made from a 100% scrap metal feedstock, commonly known as \"cold ferrous feed\" to emphasise the fact that for an EAF, scrap is a regulated feed material. The primary benefit of this is the large reduction in specific energy (energy per unit weight) required to produce the steel. Another benefit is flexibility: while blast furnace cannot vary their production by much and are never stopped, EAFs can be rapidly started and stopped, allowing the steel mill to vary production according to demand. Although steelmaking arc furnaces generally use scrap steel as their primary feedstock, if hot metal from a blast furnace or direct-reduced iron is available economically, these can also be used as furnace feed.\\n\\nA typical steelmaking arc furnace is the source of steel for a mini-mill, which may make bars or strip product. Mini-mills can be sited relatively near to the markets for steel products, and the transport requirements are less than for an integrated mill, which would commonly be sited near a harbour for access to shipping.\\n\\nAlthough the modern electric arc furnace is a highly efficient recycler of steel scrap, operation of an arc furnace shop can have adverse environmental effects. Much of the capital cost of a new installation will be devoted to systems intended to reduce these effects, which include:\\n\\nBecause of the very dynamic quality of the arc furnace load, power systems may require technical measures to maintain the quality of power for other customers; flicker and harmonic distortion are common side-effects of arc furnace operation on a power system.\\n\\nFor steelmaking, direct current (DC) arc furnaces are used, with a single electrode in the roof and the current return through a conductive bottom lining or conductive pins in the base. The advantage of DC is lower electrode consumption per ton of steel produced, since only one electrode is used, as well as less electrical harmonics and other similar problems. However, the size of DC arc furnaces is limited by the available electrodes and maximum allowable voltage. Maintenance of the conductive furnace hearth is a bottleneck in extended operation of a DC arc furnace. However, Danieli—makers of steel plant equipment—are preparing to install a 420-tonne DC furnace, powered by two 160 MVA transformers, in a Japanese steel mill. Instead of an upper graphite electrode and a lower conductive hearth, this EAF would have two upper graphite electrodes.\\n\\nIn a steel plant, a ladle furnace (LF) is used to maintain the temperature of liquid steel during processing after tapping from EAF or to change the alloy composition. The ladle is used for the first purpose when there is a delay later in the steelmaking process. The ladle furnace consists of a refractory roof, a heating system, and, when applicable, a provision for injecting argon gas into the bottom of the melt for stirring. Unlike a scrap melting furnace, a ladle furnace does not have a tilting or scrap charging mechanism.\\n\\nElectric arc furnaces are also used for production of ferroalloy and other non-ferrous alloy, and for production of phosphorus. Furnaces for these services are physically different from steel-making furnaces and may operate on a continuous, rather than batch, basis. Continuous process furnaces may also use paste-type, Søderberg electrode to prevent interruptions due to electrode changes. Such a furnace is known as a submerged arc furnace because the electrode tips are buried in the slag/charge, and arcing occurs through the slag, between the matte and the electrode. A steelmaking arc furnace, by comparison, arcs in the open. The key is the electrical resistance, which is what generates the heat required: the resistance in a steelmaking furnace is the atmosphere, while in a submerged-arc furnace the slag or charge forms the resistance. The liquid metal formed in either furnace is too conductive to form an effective heat-generating resistance.\\n\\nAmateurs have constructed a variety of arc furnaces, often based on electric arc welding kits contained by silical blocks or flower pots. Though crude, these simple furnaces are capable of melting a wide range of materials and creating calcium carbide etc. An example is shown here.\\n\\nA plasma arc furnace (PAF) uses plasma torches instead of graphite electrodes. Each of these torches consists of a casing provided with a nozzle and an axial tubing for feeding a plasma-forming gas (either nitrogen or argon), and a burnable cylindrical graphite electrode located within the tubing. Such furnaces can be referred to as \"PAM\" (Plasma Arc Melt)furnaces. They are used extensively in the titanium melt industry and similar specialty metals industries.\\n\\nVacuum arc remelting (VAR) is a secondary remelting process for vacuum refining and manufacturing of ingots with improved chemical and mechanical homogeneity.\\n\\nIn critical military and commercial aerospace applications, material engineers commonly specify VIM-VAR steels. VIM means Vacuum Induction Melted and VAR means Vacuum Arc Remelted. VIM-VAR steels become bearings for jet engines, rotor shafts for military helicopters, flap actuators for fighter jets, gears in jet or helicopter transmissions, mounts or fasteners for jet engines, jet tail hooks and other demanding applications.\\n\\nMost grades of steel are melted once and are then cast or teemed into a solid form prior to extensive forging or rolling to a metallurgically sound form. In contrast, VIM-VAR steels go through two more highly purifying melts under vacuum. After melting in an electric arc furnace and alloying in an argon oxygen decarburization vessel, steels destined for vacuum remelting are cast into ingot molds. The solidified ingots then head for a vacuum induction melting furnace. This vacuum remelting process rids the steel of inclusions and unwanted gases while optimizing the chemical composition. The VIM operation returns these solid ingots to the molten state in the contaminant-free void of a vacuum. This tightly controlled melt often requires up to 24 hours. Still enveloped by the vacuum, the hot metal flows from the VIM furnace crucible into giant electrode molds. A typical electrode stands about 15 feet (5 m) tall and will be in various diameters. The electrodes solidify under vacuum.\\n\\nFor VIM-VAR steels, the surface of the cooled electrodes must be ground to remove surface irregularities and impurities before the next vacuum remelt. Then the ground electrode is placed in a VAR furnace. In a VAR furnace the steel gradually melts drop-by-drop in the vacuum-sealed chamber. Vacuum arc remelting further removes lingering inclusions to provide superior steel cleanliness and further remove gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen. Controlling the rate at which these droplets form and solidify ensures a consistency of chemistry and microstructure throughout the entire VIM-VAR ingot. This in turn makes the steel more resistant to fracture and/or fatigue. This refinement process is essential to meet the performance characteristics of parts like a helicopter rotor shaft, a flap actuator on a military jet or a bearing in a jet engine.\\n\\nFor some commercial or military applications, steel alloys may go through only one vacuum remelt, namely the VAR. For example, steels for solid rocket cases, landing gears or torsion bars for fighting vehicles typically involve the one vacuum remelt.\\n\\nVacuum arc remelting is also used in production of titanium and other metals which are reactive or in which high purity is required.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eleutheria (play)", "body": "frameEleutheria (sometimes rendered Eleuthéria: see image) is a play by Samuel Beckett, written in French in 1947. It was his first completed drama endeavour (after an aborted effort about Samuel Johnson). Roger Blin was considering staging it in the early fifties, but opted for Waiting for Godot, because it was so much cheaper. At this point, Beckett suppressed the manuscript, as was his custom for many of his lesser works.\\n\\nIn 1985, Beckett's long term American publisher, Barney Rosset, was fired after a buyout of Grove Press. Beckett offered to help Rosset, and proposed translating Eleutheria into English for him to publish. In the end, Beckett couldn't bring himself to do so, and offered other works.\\n\\nAfter Beckett's death in 1989, Rosset still favored publishing Eleutheria in English. It was his view that, like so much other work that Beckett suppressed but eventually published, he would have changed his mind again had he lived. But Jérôme Lindon, Beckett's French publisher and literary executor, was against publication. After much wrangling and some legal threats, Lindon and the estate reluctantly allowed Rosset to publish, and issued their own in the original French. The estate will not grant performance licenses; however, a few private shows have been done.\\n\\nThe American edition, published in 1995 by Rosset's new company Foxrock, is translated by Michael Brodsky, himself a novelist and playwright. The English has been criticized as too \"American,\" and thus not appropriate for Beckett.

A British edition was published in 1996 by Faber and Faber, translated by Barbara Wright.\\n\\nThe plot concerns the efforts of a young man, Victor Krap, to cut himself off from society and his own family; the title reflects this: eleutheria (ελευθερία) is Greek for \"liberty\".\\n\\nthumbEleutheria went on stage for the first time in 2005, performed by Naqshineh theatre, as translated by Vahid Rahbani and directed by Vahid Rahbani and Mohammadreza Jouze at the City Theatre of Tehran.\\n\\n"}

Medieval sources do not even indicate whether the Hungarian princess was her mother. Elizabeth is believed to have been her daughter only because both had the same name. Some scholars report that Elizabeth was born about 1152 or 1154. \\n\\nAround 1173 Elisabeth was married to Soběslav II, Duke of Bohemia. This union was a part of the multiple dynastic arrangements made by Duke Mieszko III. As a result of this agreement, in 1176 Polish troops helped Duke Soběslav II in his fight against the House of Babenberg, rulers of Austria. In 1178 Prince Frederick (Soběslav II's cousin) besieged Prague; Elisabeth, who at that time was there, was then captured by Frederick, but soon was set free. On 27 January 1179 Soběslav II was completely defeated in battle on the outskirts of Prague. He took refuge in Skála castle, and after a long siege, Frederick won at the end of 1179 and became in the new ruler of Bohemia. Elisabeth and her husband then went into exile in Hungary, where Soběslav II died on 29 January 1180. They had no children.\\n\\nElisabeth never returned to Poland. Soon after her husband died (end January or early February 1180), she married with Conrad, fifth son of Dedi V, Margrave of Lusatia. They had three children: one son, Conrad, and two daughters, Matilda and Agnes.\\n\\nOn 16 August 1190, Margrave Dedi V died, and his domains were divided between his two surviving sons: the eldest, Dietrich, inherited the counties of Sommerschenburg and Groitzsch (as eldest heir of his mother) and the second, Conrad, received the Margraviate of Lusatia (the main paternal domain) and the county of Eilenburg. In consecuence, Elisabeth became in Margravine consort of Lusatia and Countess consort of Eilenburg. About her role in the Lusatian court there are no messages. \\n\\nAt the beginning of 1209, Conrad II defeated the army of Elisabeth's half-brother, Władysław III Spindleshanks, in the Battle of Lubusz.

He was educated by his father Joseph Perkins in Plainfield, Connecticut, where he later practiced medicine with success. Around 1795–96 Perkins invented his \"Tractors\", for which he took out a 14-year patent on February 19, 1796. The tractors consisted of two 3-inch metal rods with a point at the end. Although they were made of steel and brass, Perkins claimed that they were made of unusual metal alloys. Perkins used his rods to cure inflammation, rheumatism and pain in the head and the face. He applied the points on the aching body part and passed them over the part for about 20 minutes. Perkins claimed they could \"draw off the noxious electrical fluid that lay at the root of suffering\".\\n\\nThe Connecticut Medical Society condemned the tractors as \"delusive quackery\", and expelled Perkins from membership on the grounds that he was \"a patentee and user of nostrums\". Perkins nevertheless managed to convince three US medical faculties that his method worked. In Copenhagen, Denmark, twelve surgeons at the Royal Frederick Hospital also began to support the method. Even George Washington bought a set. Other physicians' criticisms were met with charges of elitism and professional arrogance. Perkins boasted of 5,000 cured cases. The cures were certified to by eight professors, forty physicians, and thirty clergymen. Of the purchase made by Washington, Perkins' son, Benjamin Perkins, said that the \"President of the United States, convinced of the importance of the discovery from experiments in his own family, availed himself of its advantages by purchasing a set of the Tractors for their use\".\\n\\nBenjamin Perkins was a bookseller and introduced the tractors to London. There a Perkinsian Institution for the benefit of the poor was founded under the presidency of Lord Rivers. In 1798, Benjamin published The Influence of Metallic Tractors on the Human Body. In October 1799, an advertisement in The Times said that \"The tractors, with every necessary direction for using them in Families, may be had for 5 guinea the set, of Mr. Perkins, of Leicester Square; or of Mr. Frederic Smith, Chemist & Druggist, in the Haymarket\". \\n\\nAylmer Bourke Lambert, a British botanist, is on record as having written in January 1800 to Richard Pulteney of Blandford (now Blandford Forum), in the English county of Dorset, as follows: \\n\\nShortly before his death Elisha Perkins also invented antiseptic medicine and used it for dysentery and sore throat. In 1799 he went to New York to try his methods during a yellow fever epidemic but died of the disease himself four weeks later. \\n\\nAfter Perkins' death, British physicians began to have doubts about his tractors. In 1799, Dr. John Haygarth conducted a test in which he treated five rheumatic patients with wooden tractors that were made to resemble the metallic ones. Four of them reported that the pain was relieved. The next day the patients were treated with metallic tractors with the same results. Dr. Haygarth reported on his findings in a publication entitled On the Imagination as a Cause & as a Cure of Disorders of the Body. Attempts to use the tractors to cure animals proved futile.\\n\\nBy this time, Perkins had numerous influential supporters and the sale of the tractors continued. In 1803, Thomas G. Fessenden published his poem “Terrible Tractoration” in favor of Perkins and as a satire on other physicians.\\n\\nBenjamin Perkins died in 1810. Only after that did the popularity of the tractors began to wane.\\n\\n"}

An older and more common traditions refers to him as a settler of Greece , particularly Elis in the Peloponese. The Greek Septuagint of Genesis 10 lists Elisa not only as the son of Javan, but also among the sons of Japheth, possibly a copyist's error.thumbLusitanian mythology states him (under the name Lysias/Lísias) traditionally and nowadays as an ancestor and predecessor of Lusus though this is debated. The Portuguese orator and mythographer Father António Vieira refers to Elishah (under his actual biblical name) as founder and eponym of Lisbon and Lusitania (when he came to the Iberia with his uncle Tubal), as well as the origin of the name of the mythological Elysium. It should be noticed this Iberian connection would make sense if his brother Tarshish can be rightly identified as the founder of Tartesos in Andalucia, and so both would have came to Iberia with Tubal (though this isn't the only theory on Tarshish. Elishah in this Portuguese portrayal is identified with Bacchus' captain Lysias/Lísias, sometimes also with Lusus and Phoroneus is referred as the founder of Portalegre and being buried at the Ermida de São Cristovão (Chapel of Saint Christopher) inside the town. A possible solving of these conflicting version would be considering an early Lysias, Elishas (maybe the founder of Portalegre in 1900 B.C.) and Lusos (having as mortal father king Siceleo of Iberia, grandson of Atlante/Atlas, founder of Atlantis, a possible descendent of Elishah, and possibly Bacchus as his real and divine father) as coming in between this and another Lysias son of Bacchus (the son of Semele who conquered Spain, not the son of Zeus and Io who conquered India nor the son of Jupiter and Proserpina who was an agrarian and herding culture hero), who was of a different cast but with the similarity of name to the above claimed be their reencarnation and became the new separate king of the Lusitanians since Lusus.\\n\\nJudean historian Flavius Josephus related the descendants of Elishah with the Halizones (Aeolians), one of the ancestral branches of the Greeks .\\n\\nOthers have identified Elishah with Cypriots as in ancient times the island or part of it was known as Alashiya.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eliza Jane Scovill", "body": "Eliza Jane Scovill was the daughter of AIDS denialist Christine Maggiore, an HIV-positive activist who publicly questioned the link between HIV and AIDS, and supported HIV-positive pregnant women who want to avoid taking anti-HIV medication. Eliza Jane's May 16, 2005 death from AIDS at the age of three and a half sparked a social and legal controversy over her mother's decision not to take precautions during her pregnancy to prevent transmission of the virus, and her parents' decision not to have her treated for HIV infection during her life.\\n\\nIn 1992, Eliza Jane's mother, Christine Maggiore, tested positive for HIV. She subsequently became involved in volunteer work for a number of AIDS charities, including AIDS Project Los Angeles, L.A. Shanti, and Women at Risk. However, following an interaction with prominent AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg in 1994, she began to question whether HIV causes AIDS. Maggiore came to believe that her positive test may have been due to flu shot, pregnancy, or a common viral infection.\\n\\nMaggiore chose not to take antiretroviral drugs or other measures which reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during her pregnancies. Maggiore also breast-fed her children, despite evidence that breast-feeding can also transmit HIV from mother to child. Her youngest daughter, Eliza Jane, was never tested for HIV, nor did she or her older brother Charlie receive any of the recommended childhood vaccines.(Maggiore later reported Charlie to have tested HIV-negative three times.) Maggiore discussed her beliefs as an AIDS dissident on Air America Radio in March 2005, stating that \"...our children have excellent records of health. They've never had respiratory problems, flus, intractable colds, ear infections, nothing. So, our choices, however radical they may seem, are extremely well-founded.\"\\n\\nSeveral weeks after this interview, in April 2005, Eliza Jane became ill with a runny nose. She was seen by a physician from the family's pediatric practice, who documented a normal physical exam. Several days later, Maggiore took Eliza Jane to see another pediatrician, Jay Gordon, who felt she had a mild ear infection. Reportedly, Gordon was aware of Maggiore's HIV status, but did not have Eliza Jane tested for HIV. According to the hospital report, filed just after Eliza Jane's death and based upon an interview with Maggiore, Eliza Jane \"had been diagnosed with pneumonia\" in the weeks preceding her death.\\n\\nWhen Eliza Jane failed to improve, Maggiore took her to see Philip Incao, a holistic practitioner and board member of Maggiore's AIDS-denialist organization Alive &amp; Well AIDS Alternatives. Incao stated that Eliza Jane appeared \"mildly ill... no way I considered her in danger... she did not act as a patient acts if she's severely ill or in danger.\" On May 14, 2005, Incao prescribed amoxicillin for a presumed ear infection.\\n\\nThe following day, Eliza Jane became lethargic and vomited several times. While Maggiore was on the phone with Incao, Eliza Jane collapsed and stopped breathing. She was rushed by ambulance to Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, California. Physicians attempted to resuscitate Eliza Jane, but were unsuccessful. According to the hospital report, a \"chest x-ray revealed pneumonia,\" and Eliza Jane was pronounced dead at 5:40 AM on May 16, 2005.\\n\\nAn autopsy was performed. The Los Angeles County coroner found that Eliza Jane was markedly underweight and underheight, consistent with a chronic illness, and that she had pronounced atrophy of her thymus and other lymphatic organs. Examination of her lungs showed infection with Pneumocystis jirovecii, a common opportunistic pathogen in people with AIDS and the leading cause of pediatric AIDS deaths. The post-mortem examination of Eliza Jane's brain showed changes consistent with HIV encephalitis; protein components of HIV itself were identified in Eliza Jane's brain tissue via immunohistochemistry.\\n\\nBased on the clinical information, the immunohistochemical documentation of HIV in Eliza Jane's brain, the evidence of pronounced immunosuppression, and the isolation of the opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis jirovecii from Eliza Jane's lungs, the coroner concluded that Eliza Jane had died of Pneumocystis pneumonia in the setting of advanced AIDS. This conclusion was described by the coroner as \"unequivocal\".\\n\\nMaggiore rejected the coroner's conclusion, ascribing it to political bias and attacking the personal credibility of the senior coroner, James Ribe. Maggiore retained a board member of Alive &amp; Well AIDS Alternatives, Mohammed Al-Bayati, to review the autopsy report. Al-Bayati holds a Ph.D. in comparative pathology (the pathology of animal diseases). He is not a medical doctor, nor is he board-certified in human pathology. He is the author of a book entitled Get All The Facts: HIV Does Not Cause AIDS.\\n\\nAl-Bayati released a report concluding that Eliza Jane had not died from AIDS or pneumocystis pneumonia, but from an allergic reaction to amoxicillin. Maggiore embraced Al-Bayati's conclusion that a reaction to amoxicillin was responsible, stating, \"I believe the unfortunate irony in this situation is that the one time that we were asked to and that we complied with mainstream medicine, we inadvertently gave our daughter something that took her life.\"\\n\\nAl-Bayati's report has been dismissed as both biased and medically unsound. Both the L.A. Times and ABC PrimeTime Live consulted independent experts in pathology about Eliza Jane's case; these experts agreed unequivocally with the coroner's conclusion that AIDS and resultant Pneumocystis pneumonia were the cause of death, and rejected Al-Bayati's report.\\n\\nFollowing Eliza Jane Scovill's death, Maggiore's beliefs and advocacy became points of controversy. Maggiore had held fast to her belief that HIV does not cause AIDS, and that Eliza Jane died of a reaction to amoxicillin. She submitted a letter to the LA Times alleging factual errors and omissions in their articles on Eliza Jane; the Times did not print the letter, stating that \"If facts in an article are wrong, a correction would be published. However, no correction is warranted in this case.\"\\n\\nOthers point to the evidence which indicates that Eliza Jane acquired AIDS from Maggiore perinatal or via breast feeding, that Eliza's HIV infection might have been prevented had Maggiore taken antiretroviral drugs or avoided breast feeding, that Eliza Jane's death was due to complications of AIDS, and that her death may have been preventable with proper medical care.\\n\\nJohn Moore, a prominent HIV/AIDS researcher speaking at the 16th International AIDS Conference, described Eliza Jane's death as a concrete example of the human harm that can result from pseudoscientific beliefs such as AIDS denialism:\\n\\nMaggiore's inclusion as an exhibitor at the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa has been criticized by AIDS activists.\\n\\nMaggiore's influence on Thabo Mbeki's decision to block funding of medical treatment of HIV-positive pregnant woman was criticized following her death, with medical researchers noting a Harvard study which estimated \"330,000 lives were lost to new AIDS infections during the time Mbeki blocked government funding of AZT treatment to mothers.\"\\n\\nThe journalist and AIDS denialist Celia Farber wrote an article in June 2006 in the independent paper Los Angeles CityBeat, arguing Maggiore's case and alleging incompetence, conspiracy, and coverups on the part of the coroner, the mainstream AIDS community, the mainstream media, and the medical community. In particular, Farber's article claimed that the coroner's office had not disclosed the records of Eliza Jane's HIV serology test, and quoted another denialist who claimed Eliza Jane's total lymphocyte count was elevated at the time of her death.\\n\\nThe death of Eliza Jane was investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Department of Child Protective Services as a possible case of medical neglect or child endangerment. On September 15, 2006 the LA County District Attorney's office announced that it would not file charges against Christine Maggiore, noting that Maggiore did take her sick child to several physicians.\\n\\nIn September 2006, the Medical Board of California filed charges of gross negligence against one of these physicians, Paul Fleiss, a convicted felon who was Eliza Jane's pediatrician, alleging a failure to test Eliza Jane for HIV (or to document her parents' refusal of testing), a failure to counsel Maggiore to avoid breast-feeding at any time during the three years Maggiore breast-fed her daughter, given the risk of transmitting HIV, and similar violations of standard medical practice in Fleiss' care of a second HIV-positive child.\\n\\nIn September 2007, the Medical Board of California issued its decision in the Fleiss case, effective October 8, 2007. The Board revoked Fleiss' medical license, but stayed this action in favor of a 35-month probation period during which Fleiss must submit to regular monitoring, pay costs, notify insurance and hospitals of the decision against him, and take continuing medical education (CME) classes and record-keeping courses. He is not permitted to supervise Physician's Assistants and has affirmed the practice of referring HIV-positive patients to a specialist.\\n\\nIn an admonition letter dated September 13, 2007, an Inquiry Panel of the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners issued its finding that Philip Incao's \"care and treatment and lack of timely documentation\" in the case of Eliza Jane Scovill \"falls below the generally accepted standards of medical practice\".

She was also a primary voice of the conservative women's movement.\\n\\nThe daughter of Cornell professor Edward Whiting Fox, a specialist in the history of modern Europe, and Elizabeth Simon Fox, daughter of real estate mogul Robert Simon, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese studied at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris in France and attended Bryn Mawr College, where in 1963 she received a B.A. in French and history. At Harvard University, she earned a M.A. in history in 1966 and a Ph.D. in 1974. After completing her PhD she taught at SUNY Binghamton and The University of Rochester. In 1986 she began teaching history at Emory University, where she was the Eleonore Raoul Professor of the Humanities and the founding director of the Institute for Women's Studies. At the Institute, she began the first doctoral program in Women's Studies in the U.S. and personally directed thirty-two doctoral dissertation. She was married to and sometimes collaborated with fellow historian and husband Eugene D. Genovese.\\n\\nIn 1993 Fox-Genovese and Emory University were named as co-defendants in a sexual discrimination and harassment lawsuit filed by L. Virginia Gould, one of her former graduate students. Emory settled the lawsuit out of court. Financial details were not released.\\n\\nFox-Genovese grew up in a household that was respectful of Christianity but nonbelieving, and for most of her adult life considered herself Christian only \"in the amorphous cultural sense of the word\". Having \"thoroughly imbibed materialist philosophy,\" she inhabited \"a world that took it as a matter of faith that 'God is dead'.\" In 1995, however, Fox-Genovese publicly converted to Roman Catholicism, due in part to her deep unease about \"moral relativism\" (since she found \"a world in which each followed his or her moral compass\" neither rational nor viable) and in part to the pride and self-centeredness that she said she had witnessed in the secular academy. Some regarded her reputation as a feminist as being at odds with her conversion, but she herself found it to be \"wholly consistent\" and wrote, \"Sad as it may seem, my experience with radical, upscale feminism only reinforced my growing mistrust of individual pride.\"\\n\\nFox-Genovese died in 2007, aged 65. The following year, Eugene Genovese published a tribute to his wife, Miss Betsey: A Memoir of Marriage.\\n\\nFox-Genovese's academic interests changed from French history to the history of women before the American Civil War. Virginia Shadron, assistant dean at Emory, said that Within the Plantation Household cemented the reputation of Fox-Genovese as a scholar of women in the Old South.\\n\\nFox-Genovese also wrote scholarly and popular works on feminism itself. Through her writings, she alienated many feminists but attracted many woman who may have considered themselves conservative feminists. Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz said, \"She probably did more for the conservative women's movement than anyone.... [Her] voice came from inside the academy and updated the ideas of the conservative women's movement. She was one of their most influential intellectual forces.\" Fox-Genovese reportedly had no patience with the cultural feminist trend of viewing women and men as possessing completely different values, and she criticized the idea that women's natural instincts and experience of oppression gave them a superior capacity for justice and mercy.\\n\\nEugene D.

{"title": "Elizabeth of Luxembourg", "body": "Elisabeth of Luxembourg (Visegrád, Hungary, 7 October 1409 – Győr, Hungary, 19 December 1442) was a queen consort of Hungary, Bohemia and Duchess consort of Austria. She was the interim regent of Hungary in 1439-1440, and a throne claimant and one of the participants in the Hungarian civil war 1440-1442. \\n\\nShe was the only child of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, king of Hungary and Bohemia, by his second wife Barbara of Celje. Her father was the last male descent of the House of Luxembourg on the Imperial Throne.\\n\\nHer real birth date can be calculated in virtue of a letter of King Sigismund to Kéméndi Petew fia János (John, son of Peter Kemendi), Lord-lieutenant of Zala County dated 26 April 1410 (sabbato post festum s. Georgii) at Végles, Hungary (now Vígľaš, Slovakia) and sealed with Queen Barbara of Celje's seal, who also stayed there and in which the king informs him about his daughter's birth alias circa festum beati Francisci confessoris. Because this feast falls on 4 October, it must have happened in the previous year, that is, 1409 and in October. He argues that the usage of circa can allow some variations towards September but if it had occurred in September, he would have referred to the feast of Saint Michael which falls on 29 September instead of that of Francis of Assisi. The only remaining question, namely the exact day is educed from the engagement date of his daughter to Archduke Albert which was held on 7 October 1411, Pozsony, Hungary (now Bratislava, Slovakia, Pressburg in German) and probably may have adjusted to a former important event because it belongs to no religious feasts. The birth place is also inferential and is traced back to the traditional place for the queen's labours that was in Visegrád and which is referred to in her Memoirs by Helene Kottannerin in the case of Queen Elisabeth advanced in pregnancy with Ladislas V in early 1440. In addition, Itinerary of King Sigismund shows that he stayed in Visegrad between 9–19 October 1409. In the end one concludes that her birth in Prague, on 28 February 1409, similarly to the date of 27 November this year which in reality was her christening day, is based on false sources.\\n\\nOn 28 September 1421, Pozsony, Hungary (now Bratislava, Slovakia, Pressburg in German) Elisabeth married Albert V, Duke of Austria, thus becoming Duchess of Austria. After her father died, Albert was elected King of Hungary, King of Bohemia and King of Germany. She was thus Queen consort of Hungary, Bohemia and Germany. Elisabeth was crowned on 1 January 1438 by the Bishop of Wesprim.\\n\\nAt the death of her husband, she was regarded as the rightful heir to the Hungarian throne, and she took control of Hungary as regent. She was pregnant, and she was convinced the child was a son. She prepared for the election of the next monarch of Hungary and formed a political party of followers. Among her followers were her mothers family Cilli, Ulrich Cylejskiego, the greatest fief holder in Hungary, Szécsich, Garaiów and the cities, and appointed followers to the posts of arch bishop and governor of the royal castle. By 1440, Elisabeth was the de facto ruling monarch of Hungary, and her orders were respected and carried out, though she was not yet elected by the council and confirmed as such. On 1 January 1441, the Hungarian council gathered to elect a monarch. The decision was, that because of the threats from the Ottoman Empire, Elisabeth could not be elected as monarch, but a war lord and a military leader was needed. There were also suggestions that Elisabeth should marry the male elected to be monarch. In the end, Vladislaus of Poland was elected King of Hungary.\\n\\nElisabeth officially accepted the decision, but shortly afterward, she left Budapest with her followers in possession of the crown jewels. On 15 May, she had her son crowned King of Hungary in Győr. On 22 May Vladislaus of Poland was crowned King of Hungary in Budapest. Northern Hungary supported Elisabeth, and she attacked Budapest with an army led by Jana Jiskrę z Brandysu, but was defeated. Elisabeth left her children in the care of Emperor Frederick III and financed the civil war in Austria. In 1442, a negotiation was issued by Cardinal Cesarini in Győr. Elisabeth and Vladislaus met and engaged gifts. Vladislaus gave Elisabeth fur. Shortly afterward, Elisabeth died. She was rumoured to have been poison. \\n\\nHer only son Ladislas V the Posthumous of Austria, king of Bohemia and Hungary (born 1440) died without issue, leaving the remaining kingdoms of the family to be succeeded by elected rulers.\\n\\nHer daughters Anna, Duchess of Thuringia (1432–1462), and Elisabeth, Queen of Poland (1437–1505), continued the family which afterwards regained some of these kingdoms.\\n\\nElisabeth was not the daughter of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor's first wife Mary of Hungary, and thus not descended from Angevin kings of Hungary (but in many ways, she descended from the old Árpád kings of Hungary).\\n\\nHer paternal grandparents were Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Elisabeth of Pomerania. Her maternal grandfather was Count Herman II of Celje, whose parents were the Slovenian ruler Count Herman I of Celje and Catherine of Bosnia (who apparently descended also from Nemanjic kings of Serbia and from Catherine of Hungary, a daughter of Stephen V of Hungary). In right of the paternal grandparents, she was, through Emperor Charles, an heiress of Bohemia, and through Elisabeth of Pomerania, an heiress of Poland, of its Kujavia Piast branch of kings. Thus, she was a leading claimant to several Slavic kingdoms and principalities.\\n\\nShe was also a descendant of Árpád kings of Hungary, through her great-grandmother Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292–1330), who herself was granddaughter of Kunguta Rostislavna of Halicia, whose mother Anna was a daughter of King Bela IV of Hungary. Admittedly, this was not a very close Hungarian connection, but all the other extant descendants of Árpáds were approximately as distant at that time.Additionally, she descended from Ottokar I of Bohemia's second wife Constance of Hungary, daughter of Bela III of Hungary.\\n\\n</center>\\n\\n|-\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ellen G. White Estate", "body": "thumbThe Ellen G. White Estate, Incorporated, or simply the (Ellen) White Estate, is the official organization created by Ellen G. White to act as the custodian of her writings, which are of importance to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Based at the General Conference in Silver Spring, Maryland, with which it works closely, the White Estate has branch offices and research centers at Adventist universities and colleges around the world.\\n\\nThe mission of the White Estate is to circulate Ellen White's writings, translate them, and provide resources for helping to better understand her life and ministry. At the Toronto General Conference Session in 2000, the world church expanded the mission of the organization to include a responsibility for promoting Adventist history for the entire denomination.\\n\\nOther duties include handling her properties, \"conducting the business thereof,\" \"securing the printing of new translations,\" and the \"printing of compilations from my manuscripts.\" Her will, dated Feb. 9, 1912, named five church administrators to serve as a board of trustees: Arthur G. Daniells, William C. White, Clarence C. Crisler, Charles H. Jones, and Francis M. Wilcox. Appointment of the trustees was for life, Ellen White providing that “if a vacancy shall occur for any reason among said trustees, or their successors, a majority of the surviving or remaining trustees are hereby empowered and directed to fill such vacancy by the appointment of some other fit person”; or if this provision were to fail, the General Conference Executive Committee should appoint someone to fill such a vacancy. The will dedicated the major portion of the existing and potential royalty incomes from her books to the work of the trustees.\\n\\nAt the death of Ellen White, July 16, 1915, this self-perpetuating board began to function. It soon sold Ellen White’s real estate, consisting mainly of Elmshaven, her home property near St. Helena, California, then began the continued care of her literary properties. Under the terms of the will, such responsibilities fell into three areas: \\n\\nThe board now carries a fourth responsibility, which has developed naturally through the years—acquainting Seventh-day Adventists and others with Mrs. White and her work.\\n\\nThe Original Board. When the board was organized in 1915, A. G. Daniells served as president. The secretaryship, after being held for a short time by C. C. Crisler, passed to W. C. White, the only member of the board devoting full time to the work of the trustees. He filled this office until his death in 1937. From 1915 to 1937 the work was carried on at Elmshaven in a rented office building with a vault that was used to house the E. G. White materials.\\n\\nDuring the 19 years they worked together, the original members, in addition to routine tasks, (1) published 10 posthumous compilations; (2) produced an 865-page Comprehensive Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White, published in 1926; (3) carried forward the thorough indexing of the Ellen G. White manuscript files; and (4) in counsel with the leading officers of the General Conference in 1933 and 1934, laid the foundation for continuing the trusteeship in perpetuity. The steps taken to ensure the perpetuation of the trusteeship were: (a) in 1933 the trustees, as the constituency, formed a corporation under the laws of the state of California “to carry out and perform the provisions of the charitable trust created by the last will and testament of Ellen G. White deceased”; (b) the General Conference agreed to provide adequate financial support for the work of the trustees in the form of an annual budget; the trustees, in turn, assigned to the General Conference all royalty incomes produced by the Ellen G. White books; (c) it was agreed to move the property and work of the trustees at some appropriate future time to Washington, D.C., thus placing it close to the world headquarters of the church.\\n\\nWhen three of the original trustees died—one in 1935 and two in 1936–the vacancies were filled in harmony with the provisions of the will and the bylaws of the 1933 corporation. The full-time secretary, W. C. White, died on Sept. 1, 1937. He was replaced by his son, Arthur L. White, who for nine years had served as his secretary and for four years as assistant secretary of the White Estate. The work of the White Estate was moved to the General Conference, Washington, D.C., in January, 1938.\\n\\nWith the demands upon them increasing steadily with the growth of the church and numerous constituencies to be represented, in 1950 the trustees increased the board’s membership from five to seven, and in 1958 amended the bylaws of the corporation to provide for a constituency and board of nine, seven to be life members and two to be elected for a term corresponding to that of General Conference elected personnel (originally four years, but now five). In 1970 the board was increased to 11; in 1980, to 13; and, in 1985, to 15. The number of life members is currently five. At quinquennial meetings the board also elects the secretary and associate secretaries, as well as officers of the corporation, as provided for in the bylaws.Relationship to General Conference. Through the years a close working relationship has obtained between the White trustees and the General Conference. Most of the trustees are members of the General Conference Executive Committee. Various matters, such as promoting the overseas publication of the Ellen G. White material, appropriation of funds to assist in the foreign language publication of Ellen G. White books, and overall planning of Spirit of Prophecy promotion, including preparation of materials for the annual Spirit of Prophecy Sabbath, although intimately related to the work of the White trustees, are beyond the sphere of their direct responsibility. These are handled by the General Conference Committee through a sub-committee known as the Spirit of Prophecy Committee. This committee includes several of the White trustees. The duties of this subcommittee and the working relationship between the General Conference Committee and the White Estate are currently set forth in a joint agreement adopted by the General Conference Committee and the White Estate trustees on Oct. 10, 1957. There is an interlocking and at times overlapping of responsibilities; nevertheless, a smooth and efficient working relationship between the two organizations is maintained.\\n\\nThe paid staff members: \\n\\nProductions of special value to the church include the four-volume Comprehensive Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White (1962, 1992); the six-volume facsimile reprints of the Ellen G. White Present Truth and Review and Herald articles; the four-volume Ellen G. White Signs of the Times articles; the Ellen G. White Youth’s Instructor articles; the Periodical Resource Collection volumes; the six-volume biography of Ellen G. White, by Arthur L. White; and The Published Writings of Ellen G. White on Compact Disc (CD-ROM), a tool of inestimable value to users of computers.\\n\\nBeginning in 1974 the White Estate began to set up \"Ellen G. White-SDA Research Centers\" on the campuses of Seventh-day Adventist colleges and universities. These offices contain duplicates of the Ellen White documents and other historical materials housed in the main office at General Conference headquarters. The three branch offices are located at:\\n\\nIt has local research centers around the world, including a center opened in 2004 at\\n\\nand 14 others outside North America, in:\\n\\nDuring the later years of her life, Ellen White often drew upon her unique 50,000-page manuscript file in the preparation of published works. The White trustees have continued to draw upon this for the compilations made since her death. These manuscripts constitute an invaluable basic file of historical records and of counsel to the church. The copyright of these manuscripts resides solely with the White trustees.While all of Ellen White’s writings are available for research, the unpublished letters, manuscripts, and other materials in the Ellen G. White files do not constitute a public archive. The sacred nature of the files generally and the confidential nature of many of the communications in the files require that they be cared for and used responsibly. Even manuscripts whose primary value is historical in nature must not be used in a solely secular manner. Because of this, during the first few decades following Ellen White’s death, careful policies governing the use and release of unpublished materials were set up, ultimately resulting in the publication of 21 volumes known as Manuscript Releases. In recent years the earlier restrictive policies have been adapted to accommodate the needs of increased research.\\n\\nThe two chief officers of the board are the chair and the secretary. The chair is also president of the corporation. The secretary serves not only as secretary of the board but as executive secretary of the organization, being responsible for the day-to-day operations of the office and staff. Beginning in 1915, when the terms of Ellen White’s will went into effect, the White Estate has had 10 chairs and 6 secretaries.\\n\\nEstate\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elliot in the Morning", "body": "Elliot in the Morning is a morning radio talk show hosted by DJ Elliot Segal. It airs weekdays from \"5:48 until 10-something\" on WWDC-FM in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and on WRXL in Richmond, Virginia. The program was simulcast on WOSC in Ocean City, Maryland from 2003 to 2004 and on WCHH in Baltimore, Maryland from May 2008 to November 2009.\\n\\nThe format covers a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from in-person or telephone interviews with well-known celebrities, to gross-out stunts involving many of the colorful supporting cast. The show has regular telephone interviews with Michelle Sigona (from America's Most Wanted), Mark Steines (from Entertainment Tonight) during sweeps, London Fletcher (from the Washington Redskins) and Brandon Noble (former NFL player) during football season. \\n\\nAs of 2005, Elliot in the Morning had been the cause of the fifth largest amount of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fines since 1970, with $302,500 worth of fines leveled at the show. As a result, while the show still frequently involves euphemistic mentions of sexual topics, it is broadcast with a short tape delay, and is occasionally \"dumped\" to canned music for profanity.\\n\\nOther former members: Dan Hoffman, Brett Haber, Jared Stern, and David Brody who is credited with giving Flounder his nickname (Because he looked liked Flounder from Animal House) and worked with Elliot at WHTZ.\\n\\nThe show's most prominent catchphrase has an unusual origin. The technically clean but inexplicably lewd-sounding phrase was conceived when the cast of the show was observing mug shots on the Frederick News-Post website (a local newspaper) for persons caught soliciting prostitutes. One picture that caught their eye was a badly disheveled man with a huge, bushy grey beard named Ronny Kline. Imagining what such a man might say to a woman after performing cunnilingus, the phrase “smell my face” immediately sprang to mind. \\n\\nThe phrase became a kind of \"battle cry\" and has been heavily integrated into the show’s promotional material, with bumper stickers, signs, and highly coveted T-shirts. The show’s cast and crew have also solicited (or tricked) numerous celebrities into saying the catchphrase for recordings used to promote the show. So far, there are recordings of Aaron Neville, Marguerite Perrin, Hélio Castroneves, Brittany Murphy, Mark Hoppus, Joe Frazier, Paul Stanley, Perry Farrell, Constantine Maroulis, Plain White T's, The Pussycat Dolls, Hulk Hogan, John Basedow, Josh Kelley, Sebastian Bach, Timbaland, Juliette Lewis, Pat McGee, Stephan Jenkins, Chyna, Night Ranger, Jeffrey Ross, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, and Chris Cornell.\\n\\nIn February 2000, Elliot related a lewd urban legend involving a woman who performed a sexual act with a live lobster. The show continued uninterrupted, but a message from General Manager Mark O'Brien was repeatedly played on the station later in the day condemning the story and announcing Segal's 'indefinite suspension'. Segal returned to the airwaves two days later. The episode has been replayed on \"Best of...\" versions of the show, with the offending portions censored.\\n\\nOn the morning of February 8, 2001, Elliot Segal sent Bryan \"Flounder\" Schlossberg to the south fence of the White House, where a gunman had been shot and arrested the previous day, offering passersby to a \"free shot of bush.\" The \"bush\" in question was an anatomical reference in connection to a spread of porn magazines that were on display. Flounder was connected to the airwaves via cell phone when the Secret Service surrounded him and demanded that he hang up the phone. In the end, Flounder avoided being taken into custody, but was however banned from the grounds of the White House indefinitely.\\n\\nThe morning of May 7, 2002, on D.C. metro area disc jockey Elliot Segal's radio program, DC101's \"Elliot in the Morning\", two sixteen-year-old O'Connell students called to be considered in a contest whose winners were to be cage dancers at an upcoming Kid Rock concert at George Mason University's Patriot Center. Instead, goaded by Elliot, they discussed alleged sexual activity at O'Connell. The students, who claimed to be eighteen, were named Katherine Brynn Hansen and Mary-Rose Hanson. The two discussed giving oral sex to lines of boys in the hallway and having intercourse in stairwells and closets. They implied these acts occurred during a typical school day. The students, who had used false names on air, were suspended the same day for their comments. The principal addressed the student body on the PA system and discussed the immorality of Mr. Segal's radio show. The following day (May 8), Mr. Segal, angered by the students' suspension, personally insulted the principal on air, making lewd remarks about his family and his sexual activity. He also mocked the school's mission statement, specifically what he considered to be a hypocritical statement that their educational environment is \"rooted in the life of Christ.\" The two days of broadcasting were ruled indecent by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As a result, in October 2003, sixteen months after the incident, DC101's parent company Clear Channel Communications was fined $55,000. L. Brent Bozell III, founder of nearby Alexandria, Virginia-based organization Parents Television Council, criticized both the anti-Catholic prejudice he perceived in those episodes of the program and the FCC's $55,000 fine that he claimed would not be effective for the multi-million dollar corporation Clear Channel Communications, owner of WWDC, having criticized the show back in July 2003 for its indecent content.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2003, Segal conducted an interview with whom he believed to be famous cyclist Lance Armstrong. In reality, the caller was Chad Dukes, currently the co-host of The LaVar Arrington Show on WJFK-FM in Washington, DC. Dukes stayed in character as Lance Armstrong for over seven minutes on-air without arousing the suspicions of Segal or his co-hosts. When Segal asked Dukes - still in character as Armstrong - what the greatest moment in his career was, Dukes responded that it was \"when the The Junkies moved to HFS in the mornings you jack-tool-ass-f, I can't believe you thought this was Lance Arm...!\" Segal abruptly hung up on Dukes in mid-sentence and went to commercial break.\\n\\nOn November 8, 2007, Elliot Segal announced that Dan Patrick would no longer be contributing to the show. Patrick, a former ESPN anchor, had commentated on Fridays during football season, but failed to call for two previously scheduled interviews. Elliot said, \"The Dan Patrick thing just didn't work out and that's fine.\"\\n\\nThe show was suspended on December 11 and 12, 2008. As part of an agreement to resume broadcasting, Elliot was barred from discussing the reason behind his suspension.\\n\\nThe show was pulled off the air on August 30, 2010 as Elliot spoke on the telephone with former Clear Channel employee, Jon Ballard, who was fired from sister-station WBIG-FM Big 100.3 earlier in the morning. \\n\\nThe conversation abruptly ended when the show was pulled off the air and replaced with music, most notably, \"Monkey Wrench\" by Foo Fighters. \\n\\nElliot later revealed that the show was halted at the request of WWDC DC101 program director Dave Wellington, who was subsequently removed from his position two weeks later.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ellis Worth", "body": "Ellis Worth (c. 1587 – 1659), or Woorth, was a noted English actor in the Jacobean and Caroline eras. He was a leading member of two important companies, Queen Anne's Men and Prince Charles's Men.\\n\\nNothing is known of Worth's origins or early life, or the start of his career; he was with the Queen Anne's company by 1615, and continued with the troupe until it dissolved in 1623. The paucity of the extant historical record means that little is known of the roles he played; he was most likely the \"Ellis\" who played a Lord in Robert Daborne's The Poor Man's Comfort around 1617. After 1623, Worth was a member of what is usually called the Company of the Revels at the Red Bull Theatre, and sometimes simply the Red Bull company; little is known of their activities. \\n\\nWhen Richard Gunnell built his Salisbury Court Theatre in 1629, he needed a company to act there. He brought in the new or second version of Prince Charles's Men. Worth was an original member and a \"sharer\" (partner) in this organization from 1631 to at least 1638, and probably until the theatres were closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War. He played Ardelio in the troupe's December 1631 production of Marmion's Holland's Leaguer.\\n\\nMuch of what is known of Worth's career comes from legal documents that pertain to the various controversies in which his companies were involved. The long legal battle between Susan Baskervile and Queen Anne's Men is one obvious example; that lawsuit is often known as the Worth/Baskervile suit, or Worth v. Baskervile, since Worth, due to his leading position in the troupe, was listed first among the roster of actors Baskervile sued. [See: Susan Baskervile.] Worth also testified in the Keep the Widow Waking suit in 1624 (though he testified that he had nothing to do with the play). \\n\\nThe second Prince Charles's company also had a tempestuous and litigious career, and Worth was deeply enmeshed in its controversies. Worth and Andrew Cane, the troupe's leaders, were sued by fellow actor William Bankes in 1635. Bankes invested £100 to become an actor/sharer in the company, but was unhappy with the results.\\n\\nEven after the theatres were closed, the litigation continued; Worth gave a deposition in a Chancery suit in February 1654, in which, coincidentally, he identifies himself as \"of the age of 67 or thereabouts.\" \\n\\nWorth's daughter Jane was christened in July 1613. The girl's mother died sometime before 1626, when Worth married the widow of Thomas Holcombe. Their son Elizeus was christened in March 1629.\\n\\nFor a couple of centuries, nothing was known about Worth's later years; even the year of his death was mysterious. The discovery of his last will and testament provided some valuable data on his family and surviving descendants. Regrettably, the will contains no mention of actors; Worth's colleagues had largely passed from the scene by 1659.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ellsberg paradox", "body": "The Ellsberg paradox is a paradox in decision theory and experimental economics in which people's choices violate the expected utility hypothesis. An alternate viewpoint is that expected utility theory does not properly describe actual human choices. Likewise, utility theory clashes with the Saint Petersburg Paradox which better explains how humans make their choices. \\n\\nIt is generally taken to be evidence for ambiguity aversion. The paradox was popularized by Daniel Ellsberg, although a version of it was noted considerably earlier by John Maynard Keynes.\\n\\nEllsberg raised two problems: 1 urn problem and 2 urn problem. Here, 1 urn problem is described, which is the better known one.\\n\\nSuppose you have an urn containing 30 red balls and 60 other balls that are either black or yellow. You don't know how many black or yellow balls there are, but that the total number of black balls plus the total number of yellow equals 60. The balls are well mixed so that each individual ball is as likely to be drawn as any other. You are now given a choice between two gambles:\\n\\nAlso you are given the choice between these two gambles (about a different draw from the same urn):\\n\\nThis situation poses both Knightian uncertainty – whether the non-red balls are all yellow or all black, which is not quantified – and probability – whether the ball is red or non-red, which is ⅓ vs. ⅔.\\n\\nUtility theory models the choice by assuming that in choosing between these gambles, people assume a probability that the non-red balls are yellow versus black, and then compute the expected utility of the two gambles.\\n\\nSince the prizes are exactly the same, it follows that you will prefer Gamble A to Gamble B if and only if you believe that drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball (according to expected utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that you will prefer Gamble C to Gamble D if, and only if, you believe that drawing a red or yellow ball is more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. If drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball, then drawing a red or yellow ball is also more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. So, supposing you prefer Gamble A to Gamble B, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble C to Gamble D. And, supposing instead that you prefer Gamble D to Gamble C, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble B to Gamble A.\\n\\nWhen surveyed, however, most people strictly prefer Gamble A to Gamble B and Gamble D to Gamble C. Therefore, some assumptions of the expected utility theory are violated.\\n\\nMathematically, your estimated probabilities of each color ball can be represented as: R, Y, and B. If you strictly prefer Gamble A to Gamble B, by utility theory, it is presumed this preference is reflected by the expected utilities of the two gambles: specifically, it must be the case that\\n\\nwhere  is your utility function. If  (you strictly prefer $100 to nothing), this simplifies to:\\n\\nIf you also strictly prefer Gamble D to Gamble C, the following inequality is similarly obtained:\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\nThis contradiction indicates that your preferences are inconsistent with expected-utility theory.\\n\\nNote that the result holds regardless of your utility function. Indeed, the amount of the payoff is likewise irrelevant. Whichever gamble you choose, the prize for winning it is the same, and the cost of losing it is the same (no cost), so ultimately, there are only two outcomes: you receive a specific amount of money, or you receive nothing. Therefore it is sufficient to assume that you prefer receiving some money to receiving nothing (and in fact, this assumption is not necessary in the mathematical treatment above, it was assumed U($100) > U($0), but a contradiction can still be obtained for U($100) < U($0) and for U($100) = U($0)).\\n\\nIn addition, the result holds regardless of your risk aversion. All the gambles involve risk. By choosing Gamble D, you have a 1 in 3 chance of receiving nothing, and by choosing Gamble A, you have a 2 in 3 chance of receiving nothing. If Gamble A was less risky than Gamble B, it would follow that Gamble C was less risky than Gamble D (and vice versa), so, risk is not averted in this way.\\n\\nHowever, because the exact chances of winning are known for Gambles A and D, and not known for Gambles B and C, this can be taken as evidence for some sort of ambiguity aversion which cannot be accounted for in expected utility theory. It has been demonstrated that this phenomenon occurs only when the choice set permits comparison of the ambiguous proposition with a less vague proposition (but not when ambiguous propositions are evaluated in isolation).\\n\\nThere have been various attempts to provide decision-theoretic explanations of Ellsberg's observation. Since the probabilistic information available to the decision-maker is incomplete, these attempts sometimes focus on quantifying the non-probabilistic ambiguity which the decision-maker faces – see Knightian uncertainty. That is, these alternative approaches sometimes suppose that the agent formulates a subjective (though not necessarily Bayesian) probability for possible outcomes.\\n\\nOne such attempt is based on info-gap decision theory. The agent is told precise probabilities of some outcomes, though the practical meaning of the probability numbers is not entirely clear. For instance, in the gambles discussed above, the probability of a red ball is 30/90, which is a precise number. Nonetheless, the agent may not distinguish, intuitively, between this and, say, 30/91. No probability information whatsoever is provided regarding other outcomes, so the agent has very unclear subjective impressions of these probabilities.\\n\\nIn light of the ambiguity in the probabilities of the outcomes, the agent is unable to evaluate a precise expected utility. Consequently, a choice based on maximizing the expected utility is also impossible. The info-gap approach supposes that the agent implicitly formulates info-gap models for the subjectively uncertain probabilities. The agent then tries to satisfice the expected utility and to maximize the robustness against uncertainty in the imprecise probabilities. This robust-satisficing approach can be developed explicitly to show that the choices of decision-makers should display precisely the preference reversal which Ellsberg observed.\\n\\nAnother possible explanation is that this type of game triggers a deceit aversion mechanism. Many humans naturally assume in real-world situations that if they are not told the probability of a certain event, it is to deceive them. People make the same decisions in the experiment that they would about related but not identical real-life problems where the experimenter would be likely to be a deceiver acting against the subject's interests. When faced with the choice between a red ball and a black ball, the probability of 30/90 is compared to the lower part of the 0/90-60/90 range (the probability of getting a black ball). The average person expects there to be fewer black balls than yellow balls because in most real-world situations, it would be to the advantage of the experimenter to put fewer black balls in the urn when offering such a gamble. On the other hand, when offered a choice between red and yellow balls and black and yellow balls, people assume that there must be fewer than 30 yellow balls as would be necessary to deceive them. When making the decision, it is quite possible that people simply forget to consider that the experimenter does not have a chance to modify the contents of the urn in between the draws. In real-life situations, even if the urn is not to be modified, people would be afraid of being deceived on that front as well.\\n\\nA modification of utility theory to incorporate uncertainty as distinct from risk is Choquet expected utility, which also proposes a solution to the paradox.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elmer Gantry", "body": "Elmer Gantry is a satirical novel written by Sinclair Lewis in 1926 and published by Harcourt in March 1927. \\n\\nLewis did research for the novel by observing the work of various preachers in Kansas City in his so-called \"Sunday School\" meetings on Wednesdays. He first worked with William L. \"Big Bill\" Stidger (not Burris Jenkins), pastor of the Linwood Boulevard Methodist Episcopal Church in Kansas City, Missouri. Stidger introduced Lewis to many other clergymen, among them the Reverend L.M. Birkhead, a Unitarian and an agnostic. Lewis preferred the liberal Birkhead to the conservative Stidger, and on his second visit to Kansas City, Lewis chose Birkhead as his guide. Other KC ministers Lewis interviewed included Burris Jenkins, Earl Blackman, I. M. Hargett, and Bert Fiske.\\n\\nThe character of Sharon Falconer was based on elements in the career of Aimee Semple McPherson, an American evangelist who founded the Pentecostal Christian denomination known as the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel in 1927.\\n\\nThe novel tells the story of a young, narcissistic, womanizing college athlete who abandons his early ambition to become a lawyer. The legal profession did not suit the unethical Gantry, who then became a notorious and cynical alcoholic. Gantry is mistakenly ordained as a Baptist minister, briefly acts as a \"New Thought\" evangelist, and eventually becomes a Methodist minister. He acts as manager for Sharon Falconer, an itinerant evangelist. Gantry becomes her lover but loses both her and his position when she is killed in a fire at her new tabernacle.\\n\\nDuring his career, Gantry contributes to the downfall, physical injury, and even death of key people around him, including a genuine minister, Frank Shallard. Ultimately Gantry marries well and obtains a large congregation in Lewis's fictional Midwestern city of Zenith.\\n\\nThroughout his life, Gantry continues as a false prophet and finds that his games lead to misery.\\n\\nMark Schorer, then of the University of California, Berkeley, notes: \"The forces of social good and enlightenment as presented in Elmer Gantry are not strong enough to offer any real resistance to the forces of social evil and banality.\" Schorer also says that, while researching the book, Lewis attended two or three church services every Sunday while in Kansas City, and that: \"He took advantage of every possible tangential experience in the religious community.\" The result is a novel that satirically represents the religious activity of America in evangelistic circles and the attitudes of the 1920s toward it. Elmer Gantry also appears in another, lesser known Lewis novel, Gideon Planish.\\n\\nOn publication in 1927, Elmer Gantry created a public furor. The book was banned in Boston and other cities and denounced from pulpits across the USA. One cleric suggested that Lewis should be imprisoned for five years, and there were also threats of physical violence against the author. The famous evangelist Billy Sunday called Lewis \"Satan's cohort\". The novel remains unpopular with many evangelical Christian.\\n\\nElmer Gantry ranked as the number one fiction bestseller of 1927, according to \"Publisher's Weekly\".\\n\\nShortly after the publication of Elmer Gantry, H. G. Wells published a widely-syndicated newspaper article called \"The New American People\", in which he largely based his observations of American culture on Lewis' novels.\\n\\nThere have been five adaptations of the novel. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elsa Fraenkel", "body": "Elsa Fraenkel née Rothschild (1892–1975) was a German–born British sculptress raised in Heidelberg, Germany.\\n\\nElsa Fraenkel’s interest in art began when she was a young girl. She received the support of her family in this endeavor and took drawing lessons in Brussels at age 16. She also attended History of Art lectures in Heidelberg University and studied at Karlsruhe Academy under Friedrich Fehr (drawing) and Herman Foehri (sculpture).In 1918, the year of her marriage to Dr.jur. Georg Fraenkel, she moved to Hanover, where her husband had his practice. They had two children. She lived in Hannover till 1933. While in Hannover, Germany Elsa Fraenkel travelled to Paris at least once a year to study further under Jacques Loutchansky, the sculptor, and moved in the artist circles of Constantine Brancusi, Piet Mondrian, Charles Despiau, Aristide Maillol, Fernand Léger and others.\\n\\nElsa Fraenkel began to sculpt mainly bronze life size busts of people and family members she would come across in her daily life and who struck her as being special in some way. Examples include a young American girl (1926), a musician (1927), a young Chinese (1928), an Arabian dancing girl (1929), a gypsy boxer (1930), and a mathematician lecturing with his eyes open and closed she thought was striking. None of these works were commissioned. She exhibited her works in Hanover, Berlin, Brunswick and Mannheim. Her sculpture of a young girl was purchased in 1927 by the Landesmuseum, Hanover. \\n\\nElsa Fraenkel moved to Paris in 1933 and lived there till 1935. She was influenced by the portraits of Despiau and by the Chaldean art in the Louvre. In Paris, she worked with bronze, pewter and silver. Among her works are professors she interacted with at the Sorbonne. As a result of the severe political climate in Germany against the Jews, in 1935 Elsa Fraenkel moved to St. John's Wood in London and then to Loughton, England. Fortunately she carried at least one copy of many of her works with her from Germany to Paris and eventually to England as today there is very little evidence of Elsa Fraenkel’s works in German catalogues except for the foundry where her work were cast. Her sculpture of a young girl as well as the portrait of the young Chinese were located in the Sprengel Museum, Hanover in 2008. \\n\\nUntil the end of World War II, Elsa Fraenkel was less prolific but she continued to sculpt a few individuals she would meet. After the war however, many of Elsa’s works from Germany and Paris went on show in several London galleries and museums including the Leicester Galleries, Ben Uri Gallery, Leighton House museum, Stafford Gallery, the Tate Gallery, and the Royal Academy. Her works have also been on show at the Tel Aviv Museum, the Jewish Museum in New York and the Royal Library in Copenhagen. In the 1950s Elsa Fraenkel was a contemporary of Dora Gordine (also a sculptor) and became a friend of Sylvia Pankhurst. They worked on some joint projects together. Elsa also began to receive commissions to sculpt bronze and silver busts of well known people. \\n\\nToday her works are in private collections but mostly with family members. Her work called \"Young Frenchman\" is in the permanent collection of the Tate Britain in London; \"Rabbi and Jewish Writer\" is in the Hove Museum, Hove, England; St Michael with Angels, statuette at Church of St Michael and All Angels, Dumfries Scotland; Princess Tsahai in the Royal Palace in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Sri Aurobindo in the Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, India; Queen Sirikit at the palace of Bangkok, Thailand; The Dalai Lama, in the Dalai Lama abode, Dharamsala India; Prof. Lazarus Goldschmidt’s portrait is in the Royal Library, Copenhagen, Denmark and the Jewish Museum, New York.\\n\\nFellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Vice President of the Essex Art Club, and Honorary Member of Council of \"The Royal Society for India, Pakistan and Ceylon\\n\\nElsa Fraenkel moved to Bangalore, India to live with her daughter in 1969 and died there in 1975.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emerald Mound Site", "body": "The Emerald Mound Site is a Plaquemine Mississippian period archaeological site located on the Natchez Trace Parkway near Stanton, Mississippi, United States. The site dates from the period between 1200 and 1730 CE. It was also used by the later historic Natchez people for their main ceremonial center. The platform mound is the second-largest Pre-Columbian earthwork in the country, after Monk's Mound at Cahokia, Illinois. \\n\\nThe mound covers eight acres, measuring 770 by 435 feet at the base and 35 feet in height. Emerald Mound has a flat top with two smaller secondary mounds at each end. Travelers in the early 19th century noted a number of adjoining mounds and an encircling ditch that are no longer present. Emerald Mound was stabilized by the National Park Service in 1955. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989.\\n\\nEmerald Mound was constructed during the Mississippian culture period between 1250 and 1600 CE as a ceremonial center for a population who resided in outlying villages and hamlets. It got its name from the historic Emerald Plantation that surrounded the mound back in the 19th century. The large mound began as a natural hill, which was built up by workers' depositing earth along the sides, reshaping it and creating an elongated, pentagonal-shaped, artificial plateau. Two smaller mounds sit on either end of the summit of the primary mound. The larger of the two sits at the western end, and measures 190 by 160 feet by 30 feet in height. \\n\\nThe summit of the mound is roughly 65 feet above the surrounding landscape. Early drawings suggest that six smaller mounds, three on either side, flanked the edges of the primary mound between the two secondary mounds, but were flattened by erosion and plowing in the 19th century. Originally a constructed ditch, part of the earthworks, encircled the entire complex.thumbThe Plaquemine culture builders are believed to have been the ancestors of the historic Natchez Indians. At its height, Emerald would have been the center of religious and civic rituals for the area, with the ceremonial center located on top of Emerald Mound, an unusual feature rarely seen in other mound centers. The secondary mounds were the bases of a temple and residence of a priest or ruler and other elites.\\n\\nArchaeologists believe that the later historical Natchez tribe used Emerald Mound site as their main ceremonial center. By the late 17th century, the Natchez had abandoned Emerald, possibly because of social upheaval that followed extensive fatalities from European diseases introduced to the American Southeast by the de Soto expedition in the 1540s. By the time of the La Salle Expedition of 1682, the tribe's main ceremonial center was located at the Grand Village of the Natchez/Fatherland site, 12 miles to the southwest. They added to the site during the early 18th century. The people of the tribe lived in a widely dispersed settlement pattern, mainly in small hamlets and on family farms. They periodically assembled at the ceremonial centers for religious and social events. This settlement appears to have been one of the last active expressions of the large platform mound-building culture along the Mississippi River.\\n\\nThe site, originally known as the Selzertown site, derives its present name from the nearby antebellum-era Emerald Plantation. The first excavations took place in 1838, and were recorded by John C. Van Tramp in his book Prairie and Rocky Mountain Adventures, or, Life In The West. Measurements were taken, pottery and skeletons exhumed, and the investigators noted the eight secondary mounds and a large encircling trench. Over the intervening years, periodic excavations have taken place, most recently in 1972. Animal remains, ceramic fragments, tools, and the stratigraphy—all studied by National Park Service archeologists—offer a glimpse into the life of Emerald's ancient inhabitants. \\n\\nThe owners donated the site to the National Park Service (NPS) during the 1950s. Due to damage caused by erosion of the secondary mounds, the NPS restored the mounds and sodded the surfaces in the mid-50s. A trail and stairways were constructed from the parking lot adjacent to the mound, leading to the surface of the primary platform and to the tops of the larger of the secondary mounds.\\n\\n"}

EM loan funds may be used to help producers recover from production losses (when the producer suffers a significant loss of an annual crop) or from physical losses (such as repairing or replacing damaged or destroyed structures or equipment, or for the replanting of permanent crops such as orchards). A qualified producer can then borrow up to 80% of the actual production loss or $500,000, whichever is less, at a subsidized interest rate. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emergency medical technician – basic", "body": "Emergency Medical Technician-Basic (EMT-B) is the entry level of Emergency Medical Technician (pre-hospital emergency medical provider) in the United States. \\n\\nEMT-Bs are not trained to provide definitive medical care, but instead focus on rapid in-field treatment and transport to higher medical providers. EMT-Bs work in conjunction with other medical providers such as paramedics, nurses, and physicians, as well as with other EMT-Bs. When operating in the prehospital environment, their actions are governed by protocols and procedures set by their system's physician medical director. \\n\\nEMT-B training is regulated at both the state and federal level. At the federal level, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has developed a minimum content and hour requirement that all states must at least meet. This requirement is known as the National Standard Curriculum. Under the NHTSA curriculum, students receive 170 hours of lecture and lab time covering anatomy, physiology, legal aspects of medical care, assessment, and treatment of medical, trauma, behavioral, and obstetric emergencies. In addition to class time, the NHTSA recommends clinical rotations on board ambulances and in emergency departments.\\n\\nUsing NHTSA guidelines, the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians have developed and implemented certification tests for the NHTSA EMT levels, including the EMT-Basic level. As of 2006, 39 US states utilize the NREMT EMT-Basic exam as part of the state licensing and/or certification procedure. \\n\\nOnce certified, EMT-Basics are required to obtain continuing education hours to recertify. Recertification requirements vary from state to state. Continuing education courses can cover a variety of topics, provided that they cover relevant material, including college courses covering anatomy, physiology, or psychology, to more applied courses that are either standardized, such as a Prehosptial Trauma Life Support (PHTLS), or tailored to the needs of an individual EMS system or region. \\n\\nSome states allow for an already certified EMT from another state to apply for reciprocity in their state. Reciprocity allows for, say an EMT-B from New Jersey, to apply for an EMT-B certification in New York and be certified as a New York State EMT-B without taking the EMT course over again in New York State. The states that participate in this can be found by contacting the certification boards of each state or on their websites.\\n\\nThe scope of medical practice for EMT-Bs is regulated by state law, and can vary significantly both among states as well as inside states. In general, EMT-Bs provide what is considered basic life support and are limited to essentially non-invasive procedures. Besides employing basic medical assessment skills, typical procedures provided by EMT-Bs include CPR, Automated external defibrillation, mechanical ventilation using a bag-valve mask, placement of air way adjuncts such as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways, splinting (including spinal immobilization and traction splint), and suctioning. In addition, EMT-Bs are trained to assist patients with administration of preprescribed nitroglycerin, Metered-dose inhaler such as albuterol, and epinephrine auto injectors such as the EpiPen.\\n\\nIndividually, each state is free to add or subtract to their EMT-Bs scope of practice as they please. For example, EMT-Bs working in California (known as EMT-Is (one)) and New Jersey are not allowed to administer activated charcoal, an NHTSA approved intervention, under a standard certification. Local EMS systems (i.e. counties in California) can apply to the state to implement an extended scope of practice for EMT-Bs that includes activated charcoal as well as other pharmaceutical interventions not normally allowed to be administered by EMT-Bs. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emery Theatre", "body": "The Emery Theatre, or Emery Auditorium, is a 1,600 seat acoustically pure theater located in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio. It was originally built in 1911 as the home for the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, who performed there from January 6, 1912 until 1936 when they moved to the larger Music Hall. The quality of acoustics in the hall is legendary, and was compared to that of Carnegie Hall in New York City by the famous conductor Leopold Stokowski. The design of the hall is based on the \"isacoustic curve\" principles that were first proposed by John Scott Russell. It included two balconies and was one of the first concert halls in the United States to have no obstructed seats.\\n\\nMany world renown performing artists and Broadway stars have appeared at the Emery, including George Gershwin, John Philip Sousa, Bette Davis, Arturo Toscanini, Fritz Reiner, Katherine Cornell, and Russian ballet dancers Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova. Gershwin performed Rhapsody in Blue there with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra shortly after premiering it in New York City.\\n\\nAs of December 2008 the Emery Theatre is closed for renovation, but is expected to reopen in 2011 with $3 million in investments. The theatre would be in use 300 days a year and have an estimated $3.5 million annual economic impact on the area.\\n\\nOne often stated reason for restoring the Emery is to fill Cincinnati's lack of a mid-sized venue. Cincinnati has been overlooked in favor of Louisville or Columbus because it lacks a venue that seats between 900 and 1,800 people. \\n\\nThe Cincinnati Opera and the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra have both expressed interest in using the theatre, as well as other art groups.\\n\\nThe Emery Theatre came under the ownership of the University of Cincinnati in 1969. From 1978 until 1999 the American Theatre Organ Society ran silent and sound films there.\\n\\nIn 1988 $4.5 million was secured for the Emery Theatre by Stanley Aronoff, a Cincinnati politician. However, with the help of Aronoff the University of Cincinnati diverted $3.2 million of the money to a building that houses the College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning. University trustees were so grateful for the state money they named the building the Aronoff Center for the Performing Arts. The university then used another $1.4 million of the money to renovate French Hall for University College, with only $400,000 of the original appropriation going to planning for the Emery's restoration.\\n\\nIn 2000 there were plans to raise $17.5 million in order to restore the Emery by 2004. Suggested renovations include an extended two story lobby that stretches to the corner of Walnut and Central Parkway, the removal of a wall to expand the stage house, restoration of the historic friezes and ceiling murals, elevator-accessible balcony, and the conversion of a sixth floor gymnasium into a black box space. However, because of competition with other buildings the Cincinnati Preservation Association was unable to allocate the $5 million needed from state government.\\n\\nThe University of Cincinnati can never sell the Emery due to Mary Emery's \"iron-clad will,\" so the rest of the building was redeveloped into apartments between 1999 and 2001. The complex now contains 59 units of market-rate housing, interior parking, and commercial office and retail space.\\n\\nIn July 2008 a group of over 100 local volunteers from Give Back Cincinnati spent a day cleaning up the dusty theatre.A few months later the 2008 Cincinnati Entertainment Awards were held at the Emery.\\n\\nThe Give Back Cincinnati Volunteer team returned in 2009 to continue restoration of the theater and continued cleaning the balconies, painting the first floor, and completed painting of the backstage area.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2009, the Emery Theater was temporarily opened to host Emery Jam, a fundriaser featuring local bands.\\n\\n"}

The Imam Ahmad Gragn camped there during the rainy season of 1543, after he defeated Cristovão da Gama at the Battle of Wofla. The Emperor Menas later used it as his camp during the rainy season of 1559, and thereafter it was favored as an administrative center by the succeeding Emperors: Sarsa Dengel spent the rainy season there three times between 1571 and 1580, then every rainy season for four years beginning with 1585, eventually building a stone castle there, possibly modelled on the Ottoman fort at Debarwa. \\n\\nDespite the move of the capital to Gondar, Emfraz still retained some importance in the following years.

{"title": "Emiliano Mutti", "body": "Emiliano Mutti is a geologist who has made significant contributions to petroleum geoscience, especially to sedimentary dynamics of turbidite and their reservoir characterization.\\n\\nEmiliano Mutti was born in 1933 near the small lake Orta in northern Italy. During WW II his father Ido moved the family to the small mountain village of Nociveglia in the Northern Apennines. Surrounded by rocks and forests, Emiliano developed a love for the mountains that he has never lost. Later, when he realized that the rocks in this valley were turbidites, he returned to study them and produce classic papers on deep-water depositional systems.\\n\\nEmiliano completed a Masters degree in geology at the University of Milan in 1959. His thesis was on the stratigraphy and structure of Tertiary Macigno turbidites in the Northern Apennines. From 1960-65 Emiliano was assistant professor of sedimentology at the University of Milan.\\n\\nIn 1965, interest in research led him to accept a job with the Esso Production Research Lab in Bordeaux, the European affiliate of Exxon Production Research Company in Houston. Through this connection, Emiliano met Chuck Campbell, and the two of them did field work in Italy. \\n\\nAfter several weeks, Chuck invited Emiliano to the US for additional training. The time spent with Chuck was a turning point in Emiliano's career. He describes the experience this way: \"At that time I had a lot of experience in field mapping and knew turbidites quite well. Chuck realized that I didn't know anything else. He took me into the field in the States and taught me how to recognize fluvial and shallow- marine. Most importantly he taught me his stratigraphic approach\" In 1969, Emiliano resigned from Esso to become a professor at the University of Torino. In 1971 he received his PhD and in 1975 he became a full professor. In 19sn Emiliano moved to the University of Parma where he was a full professor of sedimentary geology. Nowadays he is retired.\\n\\nDuring his career Emiliano has mainly worked on stratigraphy and sedimentology of turbidite basins in fold-thrust belts, notably in the Spanish Pyrenees, the northern Apennines, and Greece. Much of his work is summarized in classic papers co-authored with Franco Ricci Lucchi, and Bill Normark. Since 1989 his work has focused on stratigraphy and facies analysis of flood-dominated fluvio-deltaic deposits and their relationships to turbidite systems in many tectonically mobile basins worldwide.\\n\\nEmiliano is a field geologist with a very strong passion for sedimentary rocks. Anyone who has been in the field with him knows that he is a master of observation and description. He always carries a sketchpad in the field; his sketches of outcrops are extraordinary for their detail and ability to sort out complex sedimentary relationships. All of' his papers are characterized by superb photographs, which are the result for his love of photography. Emiliano has received numerous awards and honorary memberships in geological societies. \\n\\nHe has written over 100 scientific papers and several books on stratigraphy and turbidite systems. Professor Emiliano Mutti coached several geologists, mainly from Brazilian oil company Petrobras in various activities in the regions of the Spanish Pyrenees and the northern Apennines in Italy.\\n\\nIn 2004 E. Mutti won the Twenhofel Medal from SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology), which is the highest medal of recognition to a career of excellence in sedimentary geology.\\n\\nE. Mutti, R. Tinterri, E.

It was implied that the father of her aborted child is John Cooley. In the episode “Demonology”, Prentiss shared this painful memory with David Rossi while investigating the death of a childhood friend, Matthew Benton.

{"title": "Emma Watson", "body": "Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990) is an English actress and model who rose to prominence playing Hermione Granger, one of three starring roles in the ''Harry Potter'' film series. Watson was cast as Hermione at the age of nine, having previously acted only in school plays. From 2001 to 2010, she starred in seven Harry Potter films alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint; she will return for the final installment: the second part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Watson's work on the Harry Potter series has earned her several awards and more than £. She made her modelling debut for Burberry's Autumn/Winter campaign in 2009.\\n\\nIn 2007, Watson announced her involvement in two non-Harry Potter productions: the television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes and an animated film, The Tale of Despereaux. Ballet Shoes was broadcast on 26 December 2007 to an audience of 5.2 million, and The Tale of Despereaux, based on the novel by Kate DiCamillo, was released in 2008 and grossed over US $70 million in worldwide sales.\\n\\nEmma Watson was born in Paris to Jacqueline Luesby and Chris Watson, both British lawyers. Watson has one French grandmother, and lived in Paris until the age of five. Later, following her parents' divorce, she moved with her mother and younger brother to Oxfordshire.From the age of six, Watson wanted to become an actress, and for a number of years she trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing and acting. By the age of ten, she had performed in various Stagecoach productions and school plays, including Arthur: The Young Years and The Happy Prince, but she had never acted professionally before the Harry Potter series. \"I had no idea of the scale of the film series,\" she stated in a 2007 interview with Parade; \"If I had I would have been completely overwhelmed.\"\\n\\nIn 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States), the film adaptation of British author J. K. Rowling's bestselling novel. Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher, and producers were impressed by her confidence. After eight auditions, producer David Heyman told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint that they had been cast for the roles of the schoolfriends Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley respectively. Rowling supported Watson from her first screen test.\\n\\nThe release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2001 was Watson's debut screen performance. The film broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001. Critics praised the performances of the three leads, often singling out Watson for particular acclaim; The Daily Telegraph called her performance \"admirable\", and IGN said she \"stole the show\". Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in Philosopher's Stone, winning the Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actress.\\n\\nA year later, Watson again starred as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second installment of the series. Although the film received mixed reviews, reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances. The Los Angeles Times said Watson and her peers had matured between films, while The Times criticised director Chris Columbus for \"under-employing\" Watson's hugely popular character. Watson received an Otto Award from the German magazine Bravo for her performance.\\n\\nIn 2004, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released. Watson was appreciative of the more assertive role Hermione played, calling her character \"charismatic\" and \"a fantastic role to play\". Although critics panned Radcliffe's performance, labelling him \"wooden\", they praised Watson; The New York Times lauded her performance, saying \"Luckily Mr. Radcliffe's blandness is offset by Ms. Watson's spiky impatience. Harry may show off his expanding wizardly skills ... but Hermione ... earns the loudest applause with a decidedly unmagical punch to Draco Malfoy's deserving nose.\" Although Prisoner of Azkaban remains the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film as of April 2009, Watson's personal performance won her two Otto Awards and the Child Performance of the Year award from Total Film.\\n\\nWith Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), both Watson and the Harry Potter film series reached new milestones. The film set records for a Harry Potter opening weekend, a non-May opening weekend in the US, and an opening weekend in the UK. Critics praised the increasing maturity of Watson and her teenage co-stars; the New York Times called her performance \"touchingly earnest\". For Watson, much of the humour of the film sprang from the tension among the three lead characters as they matured. She said, \"I loved all the arguing. ... I think it's much more realistic that they would argue and that there would be problems.\" Nominated for three awards for Goblet of Fire, Watson won a bronze Otto Award. Later that year, Watson became the youngest person to appear on the cover of Teen Vogue, an appearance she reprised in August 2009. In 2006, Watson played Hermione in The Queen's Handbag, a special mini-episode of Harry Potter in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday.\\n\\nthumbthumbThe fifth film in the Harry Potter franchise, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released in 2007. A huge financial success, the film set a record worldwide opening-weekend gross of $332.7 million. Watson won the inaugural National Movie Award for Best Female Performance. As the fame of the actress and the series continued, Watson and fellow Harry Potter co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint left imprints of their hands, feet and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood on 9 July 2007.\\n\\nDespite the success of Order of the Phoenix, the future of the Harry Potter franchise became surrounded in doubt, as all three lead actors were hesitant to sign on to continue their roles for the final two episodes. Radcliffe eventually signed for the final films on 2 March 2007, but Watson was considerably more hesitant. She explained that the decision was significant, as the films represented a further four-year commitment to the role, but eventually conceded that she \"could never let [the role of] Hermione go\", signing for the role on 23 March 2007. In return for committing to the final films, Watson's pay was doubled to £2 million per film; she concluded that \"in the end, the pluses outweighed the minuses\". Principal photography for the sixth film began in late 2007, with Watson's part being filmed from 18 December to 17 May 2008.\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince premiered on 15 July 2009, having been controversially delayed from November 2008. With the lead actors now in their late teens, critics were increasingly willing to review them on the same level as the rest of the film's all-star cast, which the Los Angeles Times described as \"a comprehensive guide to contemporary UK acting\". The Washington Post felt Watson to have given \"[her] most charming performance to date\", while The Daily Telegraph described the lead actors as \"newly-liberated and energized, eager to give all they have to what's left of the series\".\\n\\nWatson's filming for the final installment of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, began on 18 February 2009 and ended on 12 June 2010. For financial and scripting reasons, the original book has been divided into two films which were shot back to back. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 was released in November 2010, and the second film is scheduled for release in July 2011.\\n\\nWatson's first non-Potter role was the 2007 BBC film Ballet Shoes, an adaptation of the novel of the same title by Noel Streatfeild. The film's director Sandra Goldbacher commented that Watson was \"perfect\" for the starring role of aspiring actress Pauline Fossil: \"She has a piercing, delicate aura that makes you want to gaze and gaze at her.\" Ballet Shoes was broadcast in the UK on Boxing Day 2007 to an audience of 5.7 million viewers, despite generally poor reviews.\\n\\nWatson also lent her voice to the role of Princess Pea in the animated film The Tale of Despereaux, a children's comedy starring Matthew Broderick. The Tale of Despereaux was released in December 2008 and grossed $87 million worldwide.\\n\\nIn April 2008, Watson was widely rumoured to have been cast as \"Betsy\" Bonaparte in an upcoming film titled Napoleon and Betsy, but her official website denied that any commitment had been made and the film failed to materialize. Watson has chosen to focus on her education rather than pursuing other film or television roles.\\n\\nIn May 2010, Watson was reported to be in talks to star in a film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Also that month, she announced that she would appear in a music video for One Night Only after meeting lead singer George Craig at the 2010 Winter/Summer Burberry advertising campaign. Watson also expressed an interest to be in a musical film after being involved in the Harry Potter films. The video, \"Say You Don't Want It\", was screened on Channel 4 on 26 June 2010 and released on 16 August.\\n\\nIn her first post-Harry Potter film, Watson has been cast in the upcoming My Week with Marilyn as Lucy, a wardrobe assistant who has a few dates with the main character, Colin Clark.\\n\\nAs she has grown older, Watson has become something of a fashion devotee, saying that she sees fashion as very similar to art, which she studied in school. In September 2008, she told a blogger, \"I've been focusing on art a lot, and fashion's a great extension of that.\"\\n\\nIn 2008, the British press reported that Watson was to replace Keira Knightley as the face of the fashion house Chanel, but this was flatly denied by both parties. In June 2009, following several months of rumours, Watson confirmed that she would be partnering Burberry as the face of their new campaign; she received an estimated six-figure fee for modelling Burberry's Autumn/Winter 2009 collection. She later appeared in Burberry's 2010 Spring/Summer campaign alongside her brother Alex, musicians George Craig and Matt Gilmour, and Max Hurd.\\n\\nIn September 2009, Watson announced her involvement with People Tree, a Fair Trade fashion brand. Watson worked as a 'creative advisor' for People Tree to create a spring line of clothing, which was released in February 2010; the range featured styles inspired by southern France and the City of London. The collection, described by The Times as \"very clever\" despite their \"quiet hope that [she] would become tangled at the first hemp-woven hurdle\", was widely publicised in tabloids such as You magazine, Heat Magazine, Teen Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and People. Watson, who was not paid for the collaboration, admitted that competition for the range was minimal, but argued that \"Fashion is a great way to empower people and give them skills; rather than give cash to charity you can help people by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in\"; adding, \"I think young people like me are becoming increasingly aware of the humanitarian issues surrounding fast fashion and want to make good choices but there aren't many options out there.\" Watson continued her involvement with People Tree, resulting in a release of a 2010 Autumn/Winter collection.\\n\\nthumbWatson's extended family has grown as her divorced parents each have new partners. Her father has a son, Toby, and identical twin girls, Nina and Lucy. Her mother's partner has two sons (Watson's stepbrothers), who \"regularly stay with her\". Watson's full brother, Alexander, has appeared as an extra in two Harry Potter films, and her half-sisters were cast as the young Pauline Fossil in the BBC's Ballet Shoes adaptation.\\n\\nAfter moving to Oxford with her mother and brother, Watson attended The Dragon School, an independent preparatory school, until June 2003 and then moved to Headington School, an independent school for girls, also in Oxford. While on film sets, Watson and her peers were tutored for up to five hours a day; despite the focus on filming she maintained high academic standards. In June 2006, Watson took GCSE examinations in 10 subjects, achieving eight A* and two A grades; she was a target of friendly ribbing on the Harry Potter set because of her straight-A exam results. She received A grades in her 2008 A level examinations in English Literature, Geography and Art, and in her 2007 AS (advanced subsidiary) level in History of Art.\\n\\nAfter leaving school, Watson took a gap year to film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows beginning in February 2009, but said she \"definitely want[ed] to go to university\". Despite numerous contradictory news stories, some from highly reputable sources, claiming that she would \"definitely\" attend Trinity College, Cambridge; Columbia University; Brown University or Yale University, Watson was reluctant to commit publicly to any one institution, saying that she would announce her decision first on her official website. In interviews with Jonathan Ross and David Letterman in July 2009, she confirmed that she was planning to study liberal arts in the United States, saying that – having missed so much school as a child for filming – the \"broad curriculum\" of American higher education appealed to her more than British universities, \"where you have to just choose one thing to study for three years\". In July 2009, after a second storm of rumour, The Providence Journal reported that Watson had \"grudgingly admitted\" that she had chosen Brown University, located in Providence, Rhode Island. Watson defended her attempts to avoid announcing her choice of university – accidentally slipped by Daniel Radcliffe and producer David Heyman, during interviews publicising the release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally confirmed in September 2009 after the university's academic year had started – saying that she \"want[ed] to be normal. ... I want to do it properly, like everyone else. As long as I don't walk in and see ... Harry Potter posters everywhere, I'll be fine.\"\\n\\nAs of July 2007, Watson's work in the Harry Potter series had earned her more than £10 million, and she acknowledged she would never have to work for money again. In March 2009 she was ranked 6th on the Forbes list of \"Most Valuable Young Stars\", and in February 2010 she was named as Hollywood's highest paid female star, having earned an estimated £19 million in 2009. However, she has declined to leave school to become a full-time actress, saying \"People can't understand why I don't want to ... but school life keeps me in touch with my friends. It keeps me in touch with reality.\" She has been positive about working as a child actress, saying her parents and colleagues helped make her experience a positive one. Watson enjoys a close friendship with her fellow Harry Potter stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, describing them as a \"unique support system\" for the stresses of film work, and saying that, after working with them for the ten years of the film series, \"they really are like my siblings\".\\n\\nWatson lists her interests as dancing, singing, field hockey, tennis, art, and she supports the Wild Trout Trust. She describes herself as \"a bit of a feminist\", and admires fellow actors Johnny Depp and Julia Roberts.\\n\\n"}

Entering the army from the military school of Saint-Cyr, he saw considerable active service in Algeria, and in 1840 became captain; in 1847 chef de bataillon. He first earned marked distinction in the Crimean War as colonel of a Turco-Persian regiment, and his conduct at the storm of the Mamelon won him the grade of general of brigade. \\n\\nIn the campaign of 1859 he was with General MacMahon at the battle of Magenta at the head of a brigade of Guard Infantry, and again won promotion on the battlefield. Between this campaign and the Franco-Prussian War, he was mainly employed in Algeria, and was not at first given a command in the ill-fated Army of the Rhine. But when the earlier battles revealed incapacity in the commander of the 5th corps, De Wimpffen was ordered to take it over, and was given a dormant commission appointing him to command the Army of Châlons in case of Marshal MacMahon's disablement. He only arrived at the front in time to rally the fugitives of the 5th Corps, beaten at Beaumont, and to march them to Sedan. \\n\\nIn the disastrous Battle of Sedan on the first of September, MacMahon was soon wounded, and the senior officer, General Ducrot, assumed the command.

In consequence it fell to him to negotiate the surrender of the whole French army. \\n\\nAfter his release from captivity, he lived in retirement at Algiers, and died at Paris in 1884. His later years were occupied with polemical discussions on the surrender of Sedan, the responsibility for which was laid upon him.\\n\\nHe wrote, amongst other works, Sedan (1871), La Situation de la France, et les reformes necessaires (1873) and La Nation armée (1875).\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emperor Shang of Tang", "body": "Emperor Shang (唐殤帝) (695 or 698 – September 5, 714), also known as Emperor Shao (少帝), personal name Li Chongmao (李重茂), was an emperor of the Tang Dynasty of China, ruling briefly in 710.\\n\\nLi Chongmao was the youngest son of Emperor Zhongzong, born to one of Zhongzong's concubine. As of 710, Empress Wei and her daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle were exceedingly powerful, but Li Guo'er was unable to convince Emperor Zhongzong to have her created crown princess. Empress Wei, meanwhile, wanted to become \"emperor\" like Emperor Zhongzong's mother Wu Zetian, and traditional historians believed that she and LI Guo'er poisoned Emperor Zhongzong in July 710. Empress Wei then arranged for Li Chongmao, then the Prince of Wen, to succeed Emperor Zhongzong as emperor, hoping to control the young teenager as empress dowager and regent.\\n\\nEmpress Dowager Wei's plans, however, were foiled when Empress Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi launched a coup less than a month after Emperor Shang's enthronement. Both Empress Wei and Li Guo'er were killed during the coup, and on July 25 the young emperor was forced to cede the imperial throne to Li Longji's father Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, a former emperor (as Emperor Ruizong).\\n\\nLi Chongmao, who had been emperor for only 17 days, was reverted to a princely rank and sent away from the capital Chang'an. He died four years later without having returned to the capital. Immediately after his death, Li Longji, who had by then succeeded his father Emperor Ruizong (as Emperor Xuanzong), restored Li Chongmao's imperial dignity and gave him the posthumous name Shang which literally means \"died at an early age.\" Li Chongmao is also known in histories as Emperor Shao, which literally means \"the young emperor.\" Most traditional historians do not consider him as a legitimate emperor and do not include him in the list of emperors of the Tang dynasty, although modern historians usually do.\\n\\nLi Chongmao was either born in 695 -- during a time when his father Li Xian, who was formerly an emperor of Tang Dynasty but was deposed in 694, was in exile and carried the title of Prince of Luling -- or in 698 -- after Li Xian had been recalled to then-capital Luoyang by Li Chongmao's grandmother Wu Zetian, then reigning as Empress Regnant, to be crown prince. His mother was a concubine of Li Xian's, but nothing, including her name, is written in official histories about her background. In 700, Wu Zetian created him the Prince of Beihai.\\n\\nIn 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and Li Xian was restored (as Emperor Zhongzong). He created Li Chongmao the greater title of Prince of Wen. Li Chongmao was also made titularly a commanding general of the imperial guards and the commandant at Bing Prefecture (并州, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), but did not actually report to Bing Prefecture and remained in the palace. Sometime during his stint as Prince of Wen, he married a Lady Lu as his wife and princess.\\n\\nIn 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly -- a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning by his powerful wife Empress Wei and daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle, so that Empress Wei could become \"emperor\" like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could become crown princess. Meanwhile, though, Empress Wei named Li Chongmao emperor (as Emperor Shang), but retained power as empress dowager and regent. His wife Princess Lu was created empress.\\n\\nLess than a month later, believing that Empress Dowager Wei would act against them, Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi rose in rebellion, killing Empress Dowager Wei and Li Guo'er. Li Longji's father Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, himself a former emperor, became regent instead, and the popular sentiment at the time called for Li Dan to return to the throne. When eunuch and ladies in waiting attending to the young Emperor Shang requested that one of the coup leaders who became a chancellor immediately after the coup, Liu Youqiu, draft an edict to let Emperor Shang to honor his mother as empress dowager, Liu refused and hinted that Li Dan should be emperor, and while Li Longji publicly told Liu not to speak any further, Li Longji, his brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song, and Princess Taiping were trying to persuade Li Dan to take the throne. Several days later, Li Dan agreed, and he took the throne, displacing Emperor Shang, who was still sitting on the throne during the ceremony and whom Princess Taiping grabbed by the collar to pull down from the throne. He was again given the title of Prince of Wen.\\n\\nAfter Li Chongmao's removal from the throne, he was initially housed inside the palace to prevent anyone from using him to start a coup. In 711, he was given the title of Prince of Xiang and made the prefect of Ji Prefecture (集州, roughly modern Bazhong, Sichuan). 500 imperial guards were sent to accompany and watch him. In 714, by which time Li Longji was emperor (as Emperor Xuanzong), Li Chongmao died. Li Longji restored his imperial status and gave him the posthumous name of Shang, and observed a three-day mourning period, but not the customary three years for the death of an emperor. He appeared to be sonless, as while his older brother Li Chongjun, who died in 707, was listed with a son, he was not.\\n\\n</center>\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emperorship of Marcus Aurelius", "body": "This article covers the life of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius from his accession on 7 March 161 to his death on 17 March 180. Marcus' life before his accession is covered in Early life and career of Marcus Aurelius. This article focuses on personal and administrative matters; military matters are covered in more detail in Roman–Parthian War of 161–66 and Marcomannic Wars.\\n\\nThe major sources for the life and rule of Marcus Aurelius are patchy and frequently unreliable. The biographies contained in the Historia Augusta claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century, but are in fact written by a single author (referred to here as \"the biographer\") from the later 4th century (c. 395). The later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are a tissue of lies and fiction, but the earlier biographies, derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources (Marius Maximus or Ignotus), are much better. For Marcus' life and rule, the biographies of Hadrian, Pius, Marcus and Lucius Verus are largely reliable, but those of Aelius Verus and Avidius Cassius are full of fiction.\\n\\nA body of correspondence between Marcus' tutor Fronto and various Antonine officials survives in a series of patchy manuscripts, covering the period from c. 138 to 166. Marcus' own Meditations offer a window on his inner life, but are largely undateable, and make few specific references to worldly affairs. The main narrative source for the period is Cassius Dio, a Greek senator from Bithynian Nicaea who wrote a history of Rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books. Dio is vital for the military history of the period, but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective. Some other literary sources provide specific detail: the writings of the physician Galen on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of Aelius Aristides on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the Digest and Codex Justinianus on Marcus' legal work. Inscriptions and coin finds supplement the literary sources.\\n\\nAt the death of Antoninus Pius, Marcus was effectively sole ruler of the Empire. The formalities of the position would follow: The senate would soon grant him the name Augustus and the title imperator, and he would soon be formally elected as Pontifex Maximus, chief priest of the official cults. Marcus made some show of resistance: the biographer writes that he was \"compelled\" to take imperial power. This may have been a genuine horror imperii, \"fear of imperial power\". Marcus, with his preference for the philosophic life, found the imperial office unappealing. His training as a Stoic, however, had made the choice clear. It was his duty.\\n\\nthumbAlthough Marcus shows no personal affection for Hadrian (significantly, he does not thank him in the first book of his Meditations), he presumably believed it his duty to enact the man's succession plans. Thus, although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers. The senate accepted, granting Lucius the imperium, the tribunician power, and the name Augustus. Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus' family name, Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.#tag:ref It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.#tag:ref\\n\\nIn spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more auctoritas, or \"authority\", than Lucius. He had been consul once more than Lucius, he had shared in Pius' administration, and he alone was Pontifex Maximus. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior. As the biographer wrote, \"Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor.\"\\n\\nImmediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the Castra Praetoria, the camp of the praetorian guard. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as imperatores. Then, like every new emperor since Claudius, Lucius promised the troops a special donative. This donative, however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 sesterces (5,000 denarii) per capita, more to officers. In return for this bounty, equivalent to several years' pay, the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors. The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus' accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles.\\n\\nPius' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, \"elaborate\". If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the Campus Martius, while his spirit would rise to the gods' home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Pius' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A flamen, or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Pius, now Divus Antoninus. Pius' remains were laid to rest in the Hadrian's mausoleum, beside the remains of Marcus' children and of Hadrian himself. The temple he had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.\\n\\nIn accordance with his will, Pius' fortune passed on to Faustina. (Marcus had little need of his wife's fortune. Indeed, at his accession, Marcus transferred part of his mother's estate to his nephew, Ummius Quadratus.) Faustina was three months pregnant at her husband's accession. During the pregnancy she dreamed of giving birth to two serpents, one fiercer than the other. On 31 August she gave birth at Lanuvium to twins: T. Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus.#tag:ref Aside from the fact that the twins shared Caligula's birthday, the omens were favorable, and the astrologers drew positive horoscopes for the children. The births were celebrated on the imperial coinage.\\n\\nSoon after the emperors' accession, Marcus' eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle). At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations. Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their civiliter (\"lacking pomp\") behavior. The emperors permitted free speech, evinced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. At any other time, under any other emperor, he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time, a forgiving time. And thus, as the biographer wrote, \"No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.\"\\n\\nMarcus replaced a number of the empire's major officials. The ab epistulis Sextus Caecilius Crescens Volusianus, in charge of the imperial correspondence, was replaced with Titus Varius Clemens. Clemens was from the frontier province of Pannonia and had served in the war in Mauretania. Recently, he had served as procurator of five provinces. He was a man suited for a time of military crisis. Lucius Volusius Maecianus, Marcus' former tutor, had been prefectural governor of Egypt at Marcus' accession. Maecianus was recalled, made senator, and appointed prefect of the treasury (aerarium Saturni). He was made consul soon after. Fronto's son-in-law, Aufidius Victorinus, was appointed governor of Upper Germany.\\n\\nFronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in Cirta as soon as news of his pupils' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly. The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: \"There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality.\" Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.\\n\\nthumbLucius was less esteemed by his tutor than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors. Marcus told Fronto of his reading—Coelius and a little Cicero—and his family. His daughters were in Rome, with their great-great-aunt Matidia; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them. He asked Fronto for \"some particularly eloquent reading matter, something of your own, or Cato, or Cicero, or Sallust or Gracchus—or some poet, for I need distraction, especially in this kind of way, by reading something that will uplift and diffuse my pressing anxieties.\" Marcus' early reign proceeded smoothly. Marcus was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection. Soon, however, Marcus would find he had many anxieties. It would mean the end of the felicitas temporum (\"happy times\") that the coinage of 161 had so glibly proclaimed.\\n\\nIn the spring of 162,#tag:ref the Tiber flooded over its banks, destroying much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention.#tag:ref In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.\\n\\nFronto's letters continued through Marcus' early reign. Fronto felt that, because of Marcus' prominence and public duties, lessons were more important now than they had ever been before. He believed Marcus was \"beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence\". Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: \"Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of Cleanthes and Zeno, yet, against your will, not the philosopher's woolen cape.\" The early days of Marcus' reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: his pupil was beloved by the people of Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and, perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished. Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at Cyzicus. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the senate had been awed: \"not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech\". Fronto was hugely pleased.\\n\\nOn his deathbed, Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him. One of those kings, Vologases IV of Parthia, made his move in late summer or early autumn 161. Vologases entered the Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), expelled its king and installed his own—Pacorus, an Arsacid like himself. The governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters. Convinced by the prophet Alexander of Abonutichus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself, Severianus led a legion (perhaps the IX Hispana) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.\\n\\nthumbThere was threat of war on other frontiers as well—in Britain, and in Raetia and Upper Germany, where the Chatti of the Taunus mountains had recently crossed over the limes. Marcus was unprepared. Pius seems to have given him no military experience; the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Pius' twenty-three-year reign at his emperor's side—and not in the provinces, where most previous emperors had spent their early careers.#tag:ref\\n\\nMore bad news arrived: the Syrian governor's army had been defeated by the Parthians, and retreated in disarray. Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. P. Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African senator commanding X Gemina at Vindobona (Vienna), left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian legions. Three full legions were also sent east: I Minervia from Bonn in Upper Germany, II Adiutrix from Aquincum, and V Macedonica from Troesmis. The northern frontiers were strategically weakened; frontier governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible. M. Annius Libo, Marcus' first cousin, was sent to replace the Syrian governor. He was young—his first consulship was in 161, so he was probably in his early thirties—and, as a mere patrician, lacked military experience. Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.\\n\\nMarcus took a four-day public holiday at Alsium, a resort town on the Etruria coast. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday. Fronto replied ironically: \"What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking and complete leisure for four whole days?\" He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Pius had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra, fishing, and comedy), going so far as to write up a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure. Marcus could not take Fronto's advice. \"I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off,\" he wrote back. Marcus put on Fronto's voice to chastise himself: \"'Much good has my advice done you', you will say!\" He had rested, and would rest often, but \"—this devotion to duty! Who knows better than you how demanding it is!\"\\n\\nFronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material, and, to settle his unease over the course of the Parthian war, a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto's works, it is labeled De bello Parthico (On the Parthian War). There had been reverses in Rome's past, Fronto writes, but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: \"always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs\".\\n\\nthumbOver the winter of 161–62, as more bad news arrived—a rebellion was brewing in Syria—it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, more suited to military activity. Lucius' biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius' debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, to realize that he was an emperor.#tag:ref Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and, in the summer of 162, Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; the city \"demanded the presence of an emperor\".\\n\\nLucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at Laodicea and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch. Critics declaimed Lucius' luxurious lifestyle. He had taken to gambling, they said; he would \"dice the whole night through\". He enjoyed the company of actors.#tag:ref Libo died early in the war; perhaps Lucius had murdered him.\\n\\nIn the middle of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus' daughter Lucilla. Marcus moved up the date; perhaps he had already heard of Lucius' mistress, the low-born and beautiful Panthea. Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen. Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius' father. Civica was made comes Augusti, \"companion of the emperors\"; perhaps Marcus wanted him to watch over Lucius, the job Libo had failed at.\\n\\nMarcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen. Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east. Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter, and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the group any official reception.\\n\\nThe Armenian capital Artaxata was captured in 163. At the end of the year, Verus took the title Armeniacus, despite having never seen combat; Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year. When Lucius was hailed as imperator again, however, Marcus did not hesitate to take the Imperator II with him.\\n\\n310pxOccupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. In 164, a new capital, Kaine Polis ('New City'), replaced Artaxata. A new king was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, C. Iulius Sohaemus. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch, or even Ephesus. Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend : Lucius sat on a throne with his staff while Sohamenus stood before him, saluting the emperor.\\n\\nIn 163, the Parthians intervened in Osroene, a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia centered on Edessa, and installed their own king on its throne. In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point. Before the end of 163, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank. Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town south-west of Edessa.\\n\\nIn 165, Roman forces moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, and Mannus, the king deposed by the Parthians, was re-installed. The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris. A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura. By the end of the year, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the Seleucid empire, one of Alexander the Great's successor kingdoms), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first.\\n\\nCassius' army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely. Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as imperatores again, earning the title 'imp. III'. Cassius' army returned to the field in 166, crossing over the Tigris into Media. Lucius took the title 'Medicus', and the emperors were again hailed as imperatores, becoming 'imp. IV' in imperial titulature. Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.\\n\\nMost of the credit for the war's success must be ascribed to subordinate generals, the most prominent of which was C. Avidius Cassius, commander of III Gallica, one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of Cyrrhus. His father, Heliodorus, had not been a senator, but was nonetheless a man of some standing: he had been Hadrian's ab epistulis, followed the emperor on his travels, and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrian's reign. Cassius also, with no small sense of self-worth, claimed descent from the Seleucid kings. Cassius and his fellow commander in the war, Martius Verus, still probably in their mid-thirties, took the consulships for 166. After their consulships, they were made governors: Cassius, of Syria; Martius Verus, of Cappadocia.\\n\\nAt Rome, Marcus was occupied with family matters. Matidia, his great-aunt, had died. Her will was invalid under the lex Falcidia: Matidia had assigned more than three-quarters of her estate to non-relatives; her clients had convinced her to include them in codicils to her will. Matidia had never confirmed the documents, but, as she lay unconscious, her clients had sealed them in with the original, making them valid. It was an embarrassing situation. Fronto urged Marcus to push the family's case; Marcus demurred. He was going to consult his brother, who would make the final call.#tag:ref\\n\\nOn the return from the campaign, Lucius was awarded with a triumph; the parade was unusual because it included the two emperors, their sons and unmarried daughters as a big family celebration. Marcus Aurelius' two sons, Commodus five years old and Annius Verus of three, were elevated to the status of Caesar for the occasion. \\n\\nThe returning army carried with them a plague, afterwards known as the Antonine Plague, or the Plague of Galen, which spread through the Roman Empire between 165 and 180. The disease was a pandemic believed to be either of smallpox or measles, and would ultimately claim the lives of two Roman emperors—Lucius Verus, who died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius, whose family name, Antoninus, was given to the epidemic. The disease broke out again nine years later, according to the Roman historian Dio Cassius, and caused up to 2,000 deaths a day at Rome, one quarter of those infected. Total deaths have been estimated at five million. \\n\\nA possible contact with Han China occurred in 166 when a Roman traveller visited the Han court, claiming to be an ambassador representing a certain Andun (Chinese: 安敦), who can be identified either with Marcus Aurelius or his predecessor Antoninus Pius.\\n\\nLike nearly all emperors, Marcus spent most of his time addressing petitions and hearing disputes—that is, on matters of law. Marcus took great care in the theory and practice of legislation. Professional jurists called him \"an emperor most skilled in the law\" and \"a most prudent and conscientiously just emperor\". He shows marked interest in three areas of the law: the manumission of slaves, the guardianship of orphans and minors, and the choice of city councillors (decuriones).\\n\\nleftDuring the early 160s, Fronto's son-in-law Victorinus was stationed as a legate in Germany. He was there with his wife and children (another child had stayed with Fronto and his wife in Rome). The condition on the northern frontier looked grave. A frontier post had been destroyed, and it looked like all the peoples of central and northern Europe were in turmoil. There was corruption among the officers: Victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a legionary legate who was taking bribes. Experienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family. L. Dasumius Tullius Tuscus, a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced M. Nonius Macrinus. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure Ti. Haterius Saturnius. M. Servilius Fabianus Maximus was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when Iallius Bassus had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus' son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.\\n\\nStarting in the 160s, Germanic tribes and other nomadic people launched raids along the Northern border, particularly into Gaul and across the Danube. This new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes farther east. A first invasion of the Chatti in the province of Germania Superior was repulsed in 162. Far more dangerous was the invasion of 166, when the Marcomanni of Bohemia, clients of the Roman Empire since 19, crossed the Danube together with the Lombards and other German tribes. At the same time, the Iranian Sarmatians attacked between the Danube and the Theiss rivers. \\n\\nDue to the situation in the East, only a punitive expedition could be launched in 167. Both Marcus and Verus led the troops. After the death of Verus (169), Marcus led personally the struggle against the Germans for the great part of his remaining life. The Romans suffered at least two serious defeats by the Quadi and Marcomanni, who could cross the Alps, ravage Opitergium (Oderzo) and besiege Aquileia, the Roman main city of north-east Italy. At the same time the Costoboci, coming from the Carpathian area, invaded Moesia, Macedonia and Greece. After a long struggle, Marcus Aurelius managed to push back the invaders. Numerous Germans settled in frontier regions like Dacia, Pannonia, Germany and Italy itself. This was not a new thing, but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and Marcomannia, including today's Bohemia and Hungary. \\t \\n\\nThe emperor's plans were, however, prevented by a revolt in East, led by Avidius Cassius, which was prompted by false news of the death of Marcus after an illness. Of the eastern provinces, only Cappadocia and Bithynia did not side with the rebels. When it became clear that Marcus Aurelius was still alive, Cassius' fortunes declined quickly and he was killed by his troops after only 100 days of power. \\t \\n\\nTogether with his wife Faustina, Marcus Aurelius toured the eastern provinces until 173. He visited Athens, declaring himself a protector of philosophy. After a triumph in Rome, the following year he marched again to the Danubian frontier. After a decisive victory in 178, the plan to annex Bohemia seemed poised for success but was abandoned after Marcus Aurelius again fell ill in 180.\\n\\nMarcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180, in the city of Vindobona (modern Vienna), his son and successor Commodus accompanying him. He was immediately deified and his ashes were returned to Rome, and rested in Hadrian's mausoleum (modern Castel Sant'Angelo) until the Visigoth sack of the city in 410. His campaigns against Germans and Sarmatians were also commemorated by a column and a temple built in Rome.\\n\\nMarcus Aurelius was able to secure the succession for Commodus, whom he had named Caesar in 166 and made co-emperor in 177, though the choice may have been unknowingly unfortunate. This decision, which put an end to the fortunate series of \"adoptive emperors\", was highly criticized by later historians since Commodus was a political and military outsider, as well as an extreme egotist with neurotic problems. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius' death is often held to have been the end of the Pax Romana.\\n\\nAt the end of his history of Marcus' reign, Cassius Dio wrote an encomium to the emperor, and described the transition to Commodus, to Dio's own times, with sorrow.\\n\\nIt is possible that he chose Commodus simply in the absence of other candidates, or as a result of the fear of succession issues and the possibility of civil war. Michael Grant, in The Climax of Rome (1968), writes of Commodus: \"The youth turned out to be very erratic or at least so anti-traditional that disaster was inevitable. But whether or not Marcus ought to have known this to be so, the rejections of his son's claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrous around future successions.\"\\n\\n"}

As a result, Empty Glass, when compared with The Who's 1981 album Face Dances, was considered the superior album, with many critics calling it a Who album that never was. Roger Daltrey later commented that he felt let down by Townshend, and that many of the songs from the album would have worked well for The Who, among them \"Rough Boys\" and \"Empty Glass\"; Townshend countered by saying that he felt \"Rough Boys\" was the one song Daltrey would have wanted clarified (in terms of the song's homoerotic subtext) and toned down if he were to sing it, thus defeating its message, while \"Empty Glass\" had been recorded during sessions for Who Are You in 1978, with a version featuring Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass released on the 1996 reissue of that album. This version is notable for the more suicidal undertones in the lyrics that were changed in the final, solo version. The line \"Killing each other, then we jump off the ledge\" on the Who Are You sessions was changed to \"Killing each other by driving a wedge\".\\n\\nThe sleeve was designed by photographer Bob Carlos Clarke.  The album's title is an allusion to a poem by the Sufi poet Hafez.\\n\\nThe sleeve cover of the vinyl album (SD 33-100) includes this dedication:\\n\\nAll songs were composed by Pete Townshend.\\n\\nIncluded only on the 2006 Hip-O USA and Imperial Japan CD Release\\n\\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\\n\\nSingles - Billboard (North America)\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ems Ukaz", "body": "thumbThe Ems Ukaz, or Ems Ukase (, Emskiy ukaz; , Ems’kyy ukaz), was a secret decree (ukaz) of Tsar Alexander II of Russia issued in 1876, banning the use of the Ukrainian language in print, with the exception of reprinting of old documents. The ukaz also forbade the import of Ukrainian publications and the staging of plays or lectures in Ukrainian. It was named after the city of Bad Ems, Germany, where it was promulgated.\\n\\nIn the 1860s, a decade and a half after the Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius was broken up in Kiev, and its founder Nikolay Kostomarov and other prominent figures exiled or arrested, Ukrainian intellectuals were gaining further awareness of their cultural background. Hromada cultural associations were started in a number of cities, named after the traditional village assembly, and Sunday schools in the cities and towns (education had been neglected by the Russian Imperial administration). This was partly driven by publication in both Russian and Ukrainian, including journals (such as Kostomarov's Osnova, 1861–62, and Hlibov's Chernyhosvs’kyy Lystok, 1861–63), historical and folkloristic monographs (Kostomarov's biography of Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Kulish's two-volume Zapiski o Yuzhnoy Rusi, ‘Notes on Southern Rus’’, 1856–57), and elementary primers (Kulish's Hramatka, 1857, 1861, Shevchenko's Bukvar Yuzhnoruskiy, 1861). In Osnova, Kostomarov published his influential article \"Dve russkiye narodnosti\", ‘Two Russian Nationalities’.\\n\\nAlthough Ukrainianism had been considered popular and somewhat chic in Russian cultural circles, a debate began at the time over its relation to the ideology of Russian Pan-Slavism—epitomized by a quotation of Pushkin: \"will not all the Slavic streams merge into the Russian sea?\"—and a rhetoric of criticism emerged. Conservative Russians called the Ukrainian movement a \"Polish intrigue\", while Polish commentators had been complaining that Ukrainianism had been used as a weapon against Polish culture in right-bank Ukraine.\\n\\nAfter the 1861 emancipation of serfs in the Russian Empire, many landowners were unhappy with the loss of their serfs, while peasants were generally displeased with the terms of the emancipation. In this atmosphere of distrust, increasing reports reached the imperial government that Ukrainian leaders were plotting to separate from Russia. The 1863 January Uprising in Poland raised tensions around the issue of ethnic separatism in general even further. Several Ukrainian activists were arrested, Sunday schools and hromadas were closed and their publication activities were suspended. \\n\\nA new Ukrainian translation by Pylyp Morachevsky of parts of the New Testament was vetted and passed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences, but rejected by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox church, because it was considered politically suspect. In response, Interior Minister Count Pyotr Valuyev issued a decree through an internal document circulated to the censors, on July 18, 1863. Valuyev's circular implemented a policy based on his opinion that \"the Ukrainian language never existed, does not exist, and shall never exist\". It banned publication of secular and religious books (apart from belles-lettres), on the premise that not only is the content of such publications potentially questionable, but their very existence implied the anti-imperial idea that a Ukrainian nation could exist.\\n\\nIn the 1870s, the Kiev Hromada and the South-Western Branch of the Imperial Russian Geographic Society began to publish important works in Kiev, in Russian, about Ukrainian ethnography. Authors included Mykhailo Drahomanov, Volodymyr Antonovych, Ivan Rudchenko, and Pavlo Chubynsky. They held an Archaeological Congress in 1874, and published in the Russian-language paper Kievskiy telegraf.\\n\\nA member of the Geographic Society, Mikhail Yuzefovich, sent two letters to St Petersburg warning of separatist activity. Tsar Alexander II appointed an Imperial Commission on Ukrainophile Propaganda in the Southern Provinces of Russia, which found evidence of a danger to the state, and recommended extending the scope of the Valuyev decree. While enjoying a spa in Bad Ems, Germany, in May 1876, the Tsar signed what would come to be called the \"Ems Ukaz\", extending the publication ban to apply to all books and song lyrics in the \"Little Russian dialect\", and to prohibit the import of such materials. Public lectures, plays, and song performances in Ukrainian were forbidden, suspect teachers removed from teaching, and presumably dangerous organizations and newspapers shut down.\\n\\nThe ukaz coincided with other actions against Ukrainian culture. Drahomanov and fellow activist Mykola Ziber were sacked from their posts at Kiev's University of St Vladimir, and emigrated along with other cultural leaders such as Fedir Vovk and Serhiy Podolynsky. The situation was exposed by professor Mykhailo Drahomanov at the 1878 Paris International Literary Congress.\\n\\nIn 1881, the new Tsar Alexander III amended the ukaz. Ukrainian lyrics and dictionaries would be allowed, but the Kulishivka Ukrainian alphabet was still prohibited, and such publications would have to employ Russian orthography (disparagingly called the Yaryzhka by some Ukrainians, after the Russian letter yery, ы). Performance of Ukrainian plays and humorous songs could be approved by local authorities, but Ukrainian-only theatre and troupes could not be established. \\n\\nMany illegal performances and publications were delivered through ingenuity and bribery, but Ukrainian cultural development practically ceased.\\n\\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Imperial Academy of Sciences recommended that the ukaz's restrictions be lifted. Ukrainian-language newspaper began publication, Prosvita (‘Enlightenment’) educational societies were formed, some university professors lectured in Ukrainian, and the Orthodox bishop of the Podolia vicariate, Parfeniy Levytsky, allowed the language to be used in services and church schools there. \\n\\nIn 1910, concerned about potential revolutionary activity, Interior Minister Pyotr Stolypin restored the ukaz's restrictions and shut down the Prosvita societies and Ukrainian-language publications. Russian-language press and intellectuals launched a campaign against the idea of Ukrainian autonomy or separatism.\\n\\nThus, self-aware Ukrainians remained a small intelligentsia in Dnieper Ukraine, out of touch with a much larger rural population who lacked the opportunity for a cultural education. Russian imperial ideology dominated the schools and the army, and the Russian language was the only one used for official business in the urban workplace, government offices, and public services. In the meantime, Ukrainian self-identity would grow in Austro-Hungarian Galicia, out of reach of Russian imperial authorities.\\n\\nThe ukaz was never cancelled, but became void along with all other imperial Russian laws in the February Revolution of 1917–18. After the Revolution, Ukrainian language, education and culture was allowed to flower in the Ukrainian National Republic, the Hetmanate, and under the Ukrainization policies of Soviet Ukraine before 1931.\\n\\nExcerpts from the Ukaz:\\n\\n"}

Special training is usually required to operate the software.\\n\\nData recovered by EnCase has been used successfully in various court systems around the world such as in the case of the BTK Killer.\\n\\nEnCase contains tools for several areas of the digital forensic process; acquisition, analysis and reporting. The software also includes a scripting facility called EnScript with various API's for interacting with evidence.\\n\\nEnCase contains functionality to create forensic images of suspect media. Images are stored in proprietary EnCase Evidence File Format; the compressible file format is prefixed with case data information and consists of a bit-by-bit (e.g. exact copies of the original) copy of the media inter-spaced with hashes (usually MD5 or SHA-1) for every 64K of data. The file format also appends an MD5 hash of the entire drive as a footer.\\n\\nAfter imaging, EnCase can be used to examine the files stored in the image using common tools such as a document viewer and hex editor. It can also examine parts of the filesystem not normally exposed to the user, such as deleted file entries, on-disk checksums and log/journaling data. It can also search for and attempt to recover deleted files.\\n\\nEvidential material can be \"bookmarked\" within the program and produced as a report in various formats.\\n\\nIn 2001, Jessica M.

{"title": "Enchantment (novel)", "body": "Enchantment (1999) is a fantasy novel by author Orson Scott Card. It is an almost-total re-envisioning of the Sleeping Beauty fairy-tale, as well as a number of traditional Russia folk tale.\\n\\nThe novel begins in the USSR, where young Ivan Smetski's parents are attempting to negotiate an escape from Communist Russia. To secure their exit, Ivan's parents have declared themselves Orthodox Jews to get visas for Israel, even though they secretly intend to go to America. Ivan learns that his real name is Itzak Schlomo. With the help of Cousin Marek, they emigrate to the States, where Ivan and his father eventually become two of the world's leading authorities on Old Church Slavonic, a tongue from 10th-century Russia. While doing graduate degree research in Kiev in 1992, on linguistics and folk tales, Ivan returns to Cousin Marek's farm, where he re-encounters a wooded grove he stumbled upon as a child. In the center of a lake of leaves is a beautiful sleeping woman; under the lake is a giant bear, which immediately begins throwing large rocks at him. Ivan smashes out one of the bear's eyes with a rock of his own and jumps the chasm, using his training as a high school track-and-field athlete. Then, he wakes the woman with a kiss. With the bear looming over them, she demands (in Old Church Slavonic) that he pledge to marry her. He does.\\n\\nThe princess is Katerina, of the kingdom of Taina, and now the small island has two bridges: one that only Ivan can see, leading back to the 20th century, and one that only Katerina can see, which leads to her time. Katerina leads him back to Taina, which, to Ivan's surprise, is a Christian kingdom, centuries before anyone thought there would be. Taina is under the grip of Russian arch-villainess Baba Yaga, who, with the power of an enslaved god, the Great Bear, claims to be its rightful ruler, and will hold onto her claim until Katerina is married. \\n\\nIvan has a difficult time adapting to his new setting and faces ridicule from the townspeople, Katerina included. Though Katerina and Ivan do indeed get married, they become aware of a plot led by the kingdom's strongest druzhinnik (knight) Dimitri to kill Ivan once an heir is conceived. Instead of consummating their marriage, Ivan and Katerina escape to the enchanted grove where they met and together return to Ivan's time. \\n\\nTheir escape does not derail Baba Yaga, who, exerting much of her power, follows them to the 20th century. Returning to Cousin Marek, Ivan discovers that he is, in fact, the god Mikola Mozhaiski, immortal but far reduced in power now that no one believes in him (same as the one-eyed Bear). Ivan thinks his problems are solved, but Baba Yaga's presence, and Mikola's lack of ability in martial areas, results in the newlyweds embarking on a \"honeymoon\" to America, where they hope Baba Yaga cannot follow.\\n\\nIvan's mother Esther receives Katerina warmly, and Ivan discovers to his consternation that she too uses magic; she is heir to the same mystical and ethnic traditions as Katerina. His father Piotr is less sanguine, and Ivan's former betrothed Ruth is incensed at their marriage. Katerina learns new spells from Esther; Ivan and Piotr grill Katerina on the details of her times and language; and Ivan uses the Internet to find the details on producing gunpowder, vodka for Molotov cocktails, and a hang glider, which are potential weapons for use against Baba Yaga and her army.\\n\\nThat night, Katerina uses a magic spell to check on her father and discovers that Dimitri has led a coup and poisoned King Matfei with a potion from Baba Yaga, rendering him mute. Meanwhile, Ruth, bent on revenge, buys \"love potions\" from a gypsy crone (Baba Yaga in disguise) and then proposes a Fourth of July picnic with the couple. Only some quick wits and Esther's enchantments keep the \"love potions\" from killing Ivan. It is clear that Katerina and Ivan must return to Taina. That night at dinner, Ivan pledges her his support but gets only a sorrowful smile for his trouble. Dejected, he retires to his bedroom and is surprised when Katerina joins him in bed (they had slept in separate bedrooms until then). The next morning, Ivan asks about her motive. Katerina replies that it is love.\\n\\nEsther provides Ivan and Katerina with charms and wards for the journey across, during which they will undoubtedly be hounded by Baba Yaga. Ivan takes extra precautions by booking their flight to JFK airport out of Greater Rochester International Airport instead of the more convenient Syracuse Hancock International Airport, because Baba Yaga may not know about it. She figures it out, though: a prickling of suspicion, aided by one of Esther's charms, makes Ivan forgo their scheduled plane flight, and he and Katerina pack up and leave. Shortly after takeoff, the other plane disappears from radar; Baba Yaga leaves the 20th century with the 747. With more time on their hands, Ivan and Katerina take the time to scout out natural deposits in the area of Taina (Cousin Marek's house is right where King Matfei's palace had been) and build a makeshift hang glider before taking the bridge home.\\n\\nThough Dimitri has declared martial law for Taina's protection, he is not a deft ruler, and the people rejoin Katerina and Matfei with open arms. They then plan their campaign against Baba Yaga. She has been using her captured Boeing 747 as a sort of chariot—the contemporaries describe it as a house with chicken legs—and is holding its crew and passengers prisoner in her castle. On the field of battle, Ivan will lead a group of grenadiers to winnow away her army, while Matfei and his men stand and fight. Katerina, meanwhile, will use a hang glider to enter Baba Yaga's castle and free the prisoners. The battle goes mostly to plan; however, Dimitri betrays the king at a crucial time, before being slain by Sergei, a monk friend of Ivan. At the end of the battle, Baba Yaga, using Ivan's real name in a spell, traps him in the 747 and then switches places with Bear.\\n\\nIvan faces Bear, who has already let slip some significant information to Katerina; she uses that opportunity to lay a trap, which holds Baba Yaga in place for several minutes. Bear says he's going to kill Ivan, not out of spite but simply because \"it isn't right for someone to put out the eye of a god and walk away.\" Ivan, however, realizes that he is right near his intended seat, where Katerina accidentally left a book bag containing a potent spell that breaks Bear free of his enslavement. In Baba Yaga's castle, the prisoners escape and are eventually discovered in a forest in modern-day Ukraine. Katerina also makes her escape just before the place collapses in the absence of Bear's magic. Baba Yaga, though alive, is never seen again.\\n\\nThe final chapter takes place 10 years later. Ivan is a celebrated scholar for his contributions to the field of Russian linguistics, and every year he and Katerina, along with their four children, return to Taina for the summer using the magic bridges. None of the children can cross without their assistance, and they face the ever-looming question of who will end up living where. Regardless, Ivan and his Sleeping Beauty have finally found their happy ending.\\n\\nPart of the inspiration behind Enchantment may have been Card's interest in history. In a 1998 interview given during work on the novel, Card stated that he had realized he knew little about Slavic history and suggested that the novel was inspired by extensive research in the area. In 2008, Card also credited singer/songwriter Bruce Cockburn's album The Charity of Night as an influence on his writing of the book. In the same article, he stated that he believed Enchantment might be his best novel.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Encryption", "body": "In cryptography, encryption is the process of transforming information (referred to as plaintext) using an algorithm (called cipher) to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing special knowledge, usually referred to as a key. The result of the process is encrypted information (in cryptography, referred to as ciphertext). In many contexts, the word encryption also implicitly refers to the reverse process, decryption (e.g. “software for encryption” can typically also perform decryption), to make the encrypted information readable again (i.e. to make it unencrypted).\\n\\nEncryption has long been used by militaries and governments to facilitate secret communication. Encryption is now commonly used in protecting information within many kinds of civilian systems. For example, the Computer Security Institute reported that in 2007, 71% of companies surveyed utilized encryption for some of their data in transit, and 53% utilized encryption for some of their data in storage. Encryption can be used to protect data \"at rest\", such as files on computers and storage devices (e.g. USB flash drives). In recent years there have been numerous reports of confidential data such as customers' personal records being exposed through loss or theft of laptops or backup drives. Encrypting such files at rest helps protect them should physical security measures fail. Digital rights management systems which prevent unauthorized use or reproduction of copyrighted material and protect software against reverse engineering (see also copy protection) are another somewhat different example of using encryption on data at rest.\\n\\nEncryption is also used to protect data in transit, for example data being transferred via networks (e.g. the Internet, e-commerce), mobile telephone, wireless microphone, wireless intercom systems, Bluetooth devices and bank automatic teller machine. There have been numerous reports of data in transit being intercepted in recent years. Encrypting data in transit also helps to secure it as it is often difficult to physically secure all access to networks.\\n\\nEncryption, by itself, can protect the confidentiality of messages, but other techniques are still needed to protect the integrity and authenticity of a message; for example, verification of a message authentication code (MAC) or a digital signature. Standards and cryptographic software and hardware to perform encryption are widely available, but successfully using encryption to ensure security may be a challenging problem. A single slip-up in system design or execution can allow successful attacks. Sometimes an adversary can obtain unencrypted information without directly undoing the encryption. See, e.g., traffic analysis, TEMPEST, or Trojan horse.\\n\\nOne of the earliest public key encryption applications was called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). It was written in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann and was purchased by Network Associates (now PGP Corporation) in 1997.\\n\\nThere are a number of reasons why an encryption product may not be suitable in all cases. First, e-mail must be digitally signed at the point it was created to provide non-repudiation for some legal purposes, otherwise the sender could argue that it was tampered with after it left their computer but before it was encrypted at a gateway. An encryption product may also not be practical when mobile users need to send e-mail from outside the corporate network.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Endangered language", "body": "An endangered language is a language that is at risk of falling out of use. If it loses all its native speakers, it becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all it becomes an \"extinct language\".The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. Michael E. Krauss estimated that there are about 6000 languages in active use, as of 2007. UNESCO also uses this figure. Krauss goes on to define languages as \"safe\" if children will probably be speaking them in 100 years; \"endangered\" if children will probably not be speaking them in 100 years (approximately 60-80% of languages fall into this category); and \"moribund\" if children are not speaking them now.\\n\\nThe total number of contemporary languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on the extent and means of the research intended to discover them, the definition of a distinct language and the current state of knowledge concerning the identities and vital statistics of the various peoples of the earth. Even the number of languages that are known varies as some of them become extinct or are newly discovered within the lifetimes of the active investigators.\\n\\nOne of the most active research agencies is SIL International, which maintains a database, Ethnologue, kept up-to-date by the contributions of linguists globally. Its 2005 count of the number of languages in its database, excluding duplicates in different countries, is 6912, of which 32.8% (2269) are in Asia and 30.3% (2092) are in Africa. This contemporary tally must be regarded as a variable number within a range. Michael E. Krauss reported in 2007: \"The worldwide total figure I have been using is 6000 extant languages, a nice round figure that happens to be one millionth of the human population, a kind of middle figure ....\"\\n\\nUNESCO, heavily influenced by Michael E. Krauss and Stephen Wurm, adopted the 6000 round figure and the \"new speaker\" criterion in attempting to define endangered languages.\\n\\nKrauss defines languages as safe if children will probably be speaking them in 100 years; endangered if children will probably not be speaking them in 100 years; and \"moribund\" if children are not speaking them now. He estimates 15-30% (or 900-1800) of languages are moribund.\\n\\nWhile there is no definite threshold for identifying a language as endangered, three main criteria are used as guidelines:\\n\\nSome languages, such as those in Indonesia, may have tens of thousands of speakers but may be endangered because children are no longer learning them, and speakers are in the process of shifting to using the national language Indonesian (or a local Malay variety) in place of local languages.\\n\\nIn contrast, a language with only 100 speakers might be considered very much alive if it is the primary language of a community, and is the first (or only) language of all children in that community (most of Andaman languages, actually spoken).\\n\\nAsserting that \"Language diversity is essential to the human heritage,\" UNESCO's Ad Hoc Expert Group on Endangered Languages offers this definition of an endangered language: \"... when its speakers cease to use it, use it in an increasingly reduced number of communicative domains, and cease to pass it on from one generation to the next. That is, there are no new speakers, adults or children.\"\\n\\nUNESCO's online Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger categorises 2,500 languages in five levels of endangerment: unsafe, definitely endangered, severely endangered, critically endangered and extinct. \\n\\nUNESCO's Red Book of Endangered Languages uses the classification \"potentially endangered,\" \"endangered\" and \"severely endangered.\"\\n\\nOnce a language is determined to be endangered, there are two basic steps that need to be taken in order to stabilize or rescue the language. The first is language documentation and the second is language revitalization.\\n\\nLanguage documentation is the process by which the language is documented in terms of its grammar, its lexicon, and its oral traditions (e.g. stories, songs, religious texts). \\n\\nLanguage revitalization is the process by which a language community through political, community, and educational means attempts to increase the number of active speakers of the endangered language. This process is also sometimes referred to as language revival or reversing language shift. \\n\\nAnother option is \"post-vernacular maintenance\": the teaching of some words and concepts related to the lost language - rather than revival proper.\\n\\n"}

On 5 May that year Arnulf had had to intervene to return some land wrongfully taken from Megingoz, a vassal of Erkenbold, Bishop of Eichstätt, by Engeldeo and Hildegard. That these latter two were acting in concert at the same time as they were both deprived of public office in Bavaria suggests that they were allies against the interests of the king. Perhaps they were kinsman, perhaps they were engaged in an affair. The king's action was justified by the \"judgement of the Franks, Bavarians, Saxons, and Alemans\".\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Engineering design process", "body": "The engineering design process is a formulation of a plan or scheme to assist an engineer in creating a product. The engineering design is defined as:\\n\\nThe engineering design process is a multi-step process including the research, conceptualization, feasibility assessment, establishing design requirements, preliminary design, detailed design, production planning and tool design, and finally production. The sections to follow are not necessarily steps in the engineering design process, for some tasks are completed at the same time as other tasks. This is just a general summary of each step of the engineering design process.\\n\\nA significant amount of time is spent on research, locating, applying, and transferring information . Consideration should be given to the existing applicable literature, problems and successes associated with existing solutions, costs, and marketplace needs. \\n\\nThe source of information should be relevant, including existing solutions. Reverse engineering can be an effective technique if other solutions are available on the market . Other sources of information include the Internet, local libraries, available government documents, personal organizations, trade journal, vendor catalogs and individual experts available .\\n\\nOnce an engineering issue is clearly defined, solutions must be identified. These solutions can be found by using ideation, or the mental process by which ideas are generated. The following are the most widely used techniques:\\n\\nThe purpose of a feasibility assessment is to determine whether the engineer's project can proceed into the design phase. This is based on two criteria: the project needs to be based on an achievable idea, and it needs to be within cost constraints. It is of utmost importance to have an engineer with experience and good judgment to be involved in this portion of the feasibility study, for they know whether the engineer's project is possible or not.\\n\\nEstablishing design requirements is one of the most important elements in the design process, and this task is normally performed at the same time as the feasibility analysis. The design requirements control the design of the project throughout the engineering design process. Some design requirements include hardware and software parameters, maintainability, availability, and testability.\\n\\nThe preliminary design bridges the gap between the design concept and the detailed design phase. The preliminary design phase is also called embodiment design. In this task, the overall system configuration is defined, and schematic, diagram, and layout of the project will provide early project configuration. During detailed design and optimization, the parameters of the part being created will change, but the preliminary design focuses on creating the general framework to build the project on.\\n\\nThe detailed design portion of the engineering design process is the task where the engineer can completely describe a product through solid modeling and drawings. Some specifications include:\\n\\nThe advancement of computer-aided design, or CAD, programs have made the detailed design phase more efficient. This is because a CAD program can provide optimization, where it can reduce volume without hindering the part's quality. It can also calculate stress and displacement using the finite element method to determine stresses throughout the part. It is the engineer's responsibility to determine whether these stresses and displacements are allowable, so the part is safe.\\n\\nThe production planning and tool design is nothing more than planning how to mass produce the project and which tools should be used in the manufacturing of the part. Tasks to complete in this step include selecting the material, selection of the production processes, determination of the sequence of operations, and selection of tools, such as jigs, fixtures, and tooling. This task also involves testing a working prototype to ensure the created part meets qualification standards.\\n\\nWith the completion of qualification testing and prototype testing, the engineering design process is finalized. The part must now be manufactured, and the machines must be inspected regularly to make sure that they do not break down and slow production.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "England v United States (1950)", "body": "On 29 June 1950, at the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the United States defeated England 1–0 in a group match. This unexpected result has led to the match being described as the \"Miracle on Grass\", in reference to the 1980 Miracle on Ice, in which the US ice hockey team beat the Soviet Union. The match was played in Belo Horizonte at Estádio Independência. The game and the U.S. team were profiled by author Geoffrey Douglas in his book The Game of Their Lives, which was made into a film of the same name (later renamed as The Miracle Match).\\n\\nAt the time, the English considered themselves the \"Kings of Football\", with a post-war record of 23 wins, 4 losses, and 3 draws. Conversely, the Americans had lost their last seven international matches (including the 1934 World Cup and 1948 Summer Olympics) by the combined score of 45–2. The odds were 3–1 the English would win the Cup, and 500–1 for the U.S.\\n\\nEngland had Stanley Matthews available, who was widely considered one of the best players in the world at the time, but he had not played with the English team in the three international matches prior to the World Cup (in fact, he had joined the team late, having been touring Canada as part of another group of English internationals). As such, the selection committee (consisting entirely of Arthur Drewry, then president of the English/Wales Football League and later the president of FIFA), opted to stay with the team that had just defeated Chile. As there were no substitutes allowed in those days, Matthews watched the game with the other reserves.\\n\\nThe American team consisted of semi-professional players, most of whom had other jobs to support their families. Walter Bahr was a high school teacher, Frank Borghi drove a hearse for his uncle's funeral parlor, and others worked as mail carriers or dishwashers. The team had also been hastily assembled, and had only been able to train together once, and that was the day before they left for Brazil, which happened to be against the touring English team featuring Matthews. Three players—Joe Maca, Ed McIlvenny, and Joe Gaetjens—were added to the roster just prior to that game. \"We have no chance,\" recently-appointed coach Bill Jeffrey told the press.\\n\\nEngland and the U.S. were in Group 2 of the first round robin, along with Spain and Chile.\\n\\nEngland won the toss and elected to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross from the left wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the twelfth minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.\\n\\nThe U.S. struggled to move to the offense, and finally managed a shot on goal in the twenty-fifth minute, which was blocked by English goalkeeper Bert Williams. The English counterattacked with three successive clear shots at the goal in minutes 30, 31, and 32, but failed to score. Mortensen twice went over the crossbar, and Tom Finney's header to the top corner was tipped away by Borghi.\\n\\nIn the thirty-seventh minute, Bahr took a long shot twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong and grazed the ball enough to put it to the left of the English goalkeeper, whose momentum prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to tie the score, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.\\n\\nWith renewed confidence, the U.S. played tougher as the second half opened, creating another scoring opportunity in the 54th minute. In the 59th minute England was awarded a direct free kick but Mortensen's shot was well saved by Borghi. But England began threatening again, and it was fifteen minutes before the Americans were able to get another shot. With eight minutes left, Charlie Colombo brought down Mortensen with an illegal tackle at the edge of the penalty area. England pleaded for a penalty kick, but the referee ruled it was outside the box. On the resulting free kick, Jimmy Mullen headed the ball for what he thought was a goal, failing to notice that Borghi had tipped it away at the last second, denying the English the chance to tie the game.\\n\\nEngland had no more chances on goal and the game ended in victory for the U.S. team.\\n\\nEngland lost their next match and failed to qualify for the Final Round, finishing the First Round with a record of 1–0–2.\\n\\nThe U.S. lost their next match 5–2, versus Chile, ending their 1950 World Cup run with a First Round record of 1–0–2. They would not qualify for the World Cup again until 1990.\\n\\nSpain advanced from Group 2 of the First Round, finishing last in next/Final Round. Uruguay won the 1950 World Cup.\\n\\nJohn Souza, the U.S. inside right forward, was selected to the World Cup All-Star team by the Brazil sports newspaper Mundo Esportivo, and remained the only American player selected to a World Cup All-Star team until Claudio Reyna in 2002.\\n\\nNewspaper headlines in most World Cup nations trumpeted the shocking upset, except in the United States and England.\\n\\nThere was only one American journalist even at the World Cup: Dent McSkimming of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, who could not get the newspaper to pay for the trip, and had taken time off work to cover the event. His report of the match was the only one to appear in any major American newspaper.\\n\\nIn England, newspapers at the time were generally small, and only had a single page devoted to sports. Because the English cricket team happened to suffer their first-ever defeat to the West Indies the very same day, that was the major story in most publications. However, in publications that did report the World Cup match, so unexpected was the result that it was presumed that the 1–0 scoreline was a typing error and so it was reported that England had won on a scoreline of 10–0 or 10–1.\\n\\nAfterwards, a number of books and newspapers in England suggested that the U.S. team had arrived \"through Ellis Island\", meaning that the team was made up of imported players, but eight of the starting eleven were American-born. The other three, Gaetjens, McIlvenny, and Maca, were not U.S. citizens but had declared their intentions to gain citizenship and according to the rules of the United States Soccer Football Association at the time were allowed to play. The U.S. was cleared of any wrongdoing by FIFA in a hearing on 2 December 1950.\\n\\nEngland's blue kit, which had made its debut in this match, was never worn again. Walter Bahr erroneously notes that England has never had a blue kit since then, but a blue away kit was worn again in 1959 during a 1–4 loss to Peru.\\n\\nThe United States and England did not play another World Cup match against each other until the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which ended in a 1–1 draw.\\n\\nUnited States 1950England 1950\\n\\n"}

Eventually, Tseboath was replaced by Nebiros. \\n\\n1996, along with Ancient Rites and Bewitched, Enthroned began an extensive tour of Europe. \\n\\nIn April 1997, as Enthroned was to begin recording Towards the Skullthrone of the Nile, Cernunnos took his life. Enthroned recorded the album with a session drummer in honor of Cernunnos and performed at the Dragons Blaze festival with newly acquired drummer Namroth Blackthorn. \\n\\nIn April 1998, the band toured the European continent with Dark Funeral and also released the MCD Regie Axese which was dedicated to their former drummer Cernunnos. Later that year, they toured again with labelmates Hecate Enthroned and Usurper. At the close of 1998, the band entered Abyss Studios (Sweden) to record The Apocalypse Manifesto. This third album was released in May 1999, which dealt with the biblical concept of the Apocalypse as interpreted by a Norse mythological perspective. \\n\\nEnthroned rounded off the 20th Century on tour with Marduk and continued to take European crowds by storm with several other live performances. \\n\\nIn 2000, the band parted ways with Nebiros and recruited Nerath Daemon as their new guitarist, went on a German mini tour followed by several other European shows and recorded Armoured Bestial of Destruction in the Real Sound Studio (Germany). This fourth album was released in April 2001. Namroth Blackthorn was replaced by Alsvid from the French Black Metal band Seth. Enthroned continued to play many live gigs in and around Europe, as well as in the US. \\n\\nIn early 2002, Enthroned signed to Napalm Records releasing their fifth full-length recording, Carnage in Worlds Beyond, later that year. In June 2003, Nguaroth (guitars) and Glaurung (drums) joined Enthroned played a South American tour and released their sixth album, XES Haereticum. \\n\\nIn 2005, Enthroned released their first official live album, Black Born Warriors, recorded during their tour of Brazil. Enthroned parted ways with longtime vocalist Sabathan, at which time Nornagest took over the vocals, Phorgath joined the band on bass. \\n\\nIn June 2007, Enthroned recorded their seventh album Tetra Karcist, seeing the return of old drummer Alsvid for the studio sessions. \\n\\nAhephahim joined as the new official drummer in June 2007 and Enthroned signed with Regain Records in January 2008. At this time, some members of the band opened a recording studio, Blackout Multimedia. In the mean time, Ahephaim & Nguaroth left the band due to a lack of time and were replaced by ex-Gorgoroth drummer Garghuf and Nerath Daemon took back the position he left five years ago in Enthroned, changing his name to Neraath. Enthroned's eight album, Black Mass of Pain, was released on 22 March 2010. Since then, Nornagest has given up playing guitar in live performances, due to him developing chronic tendinitis in his wrist, and has instead become the band's frontman. Former members Lord Sabathan and Nguaroth joined the band for a one-off live performance in 2010 as an act of reconciliation.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "EoN Olympia", "body": "{||}\\n\\nThe Eon Olympia was a glider produced from 1947 by Elliotts of Newbury.\\n\\nElliotts had been asked in 1945 by Chilton Aircraft Ltd to make one set of wings for the Chilton Olympia, a glider that had been developed in pre-war Germany as the DFS Olympia Meise. This had been designed by Hans Jacobs and selected as the glider for the 1940 Summer Olympics. The German drawings were not detailed and so entirely new drawings were made by Chilton that merely retained the Meise Olympia's aerodynamic shape. Otherwise it was a complete re-design and resulted in a stronger and heavier aircraft. To maintain employment at their factory, Elliotts refused to sell the wing jigs that they had made for the prototype. Consequently Chilton gave up all aircraft work, agreeing to sell to Elliotts the production rights, fuselage jigs, and work in hand on all Olympia gliders.\\n\\nProduction of the Olympia (originally called Type 5) started in 1946 as a batch of 100, and the first flight was made in January 1947. Elliotts and their design consultants Aviation & Engineering Products Ltd made improvements to the original design before starting production. Marks 1, 2 and 3 were produced, mainly distinguishable by the landing gear. The Mark 1 had only a skid whereas the Olympia 2 had a built-in main wheel. The Eon Olympia 3's wheel was jettisonable after take off. The first batch of 100 was completed in 1947 but the market could not absorb such a large number, despite the low price of £425. Even by 1953, 40 of the first 100 Olympias were still unsold. Nevertheless a second batch of 50 was built. Gliders from the second batch were still being offered for sale for £800 as late as 1957 in order to clear the stock, despite being below cost price.\\n\\nOn 24 August 1950 an Eon Olympia flown by Bill Bedford broke the British distance record by flying 310 km in 3:50 hr. On 2 May 1951 Bedford broke his record with a flight of 413 km from Farnborough to Newcastle. Olympias also broke height records on occasions, culminating in a flight by Gordon Rondel on 18 June 1960 in a thunderstorm to 9,321 m (30,580 ft) with gain of height of 8,870 m (29,100 ft), absolute National height and gain of height records.\\n\\nAfter building three marks of the Olympia, another improved version, called the EoN Olympia 4 was produced in 1954. This is regarded as being sufficiently different from the original as being a new type. This type in turn led to a succession of variants.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Epoché", "body": "Epochè (ἐποχή, epokhē \"suspension\") is an ancient Greek term which, in its philosophical usage, describes the theoretical moment where all judgments about the existence of the external world, and consequently all action in the world, are suspended. One's own consciousness is subject to immanent critique so that when such belief is recovered, it will have a firmer grounding in consciousness. This concept was developed by the Greek skeptics and plays an implicit role in skeptical thought, as in René Descartes' epistemic principle of methodic doubt. The term was popularized in philosophy by Edmund Husserl. Husserl elaborates the notion of 'phenomenological epoché' or 'bracketing' in Ideas I. Through the systematic procedure of phenomenological reduction, one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness.\\n\\nEpochè played an important role in Pyrrhonism, the skeptical philosophy of Pyrrho. On the basis of claiming that we do not know anything, Pyrrho argued that the preferred attitude to be adopted is epochè, i.e., the suspension of judgment or the withholding of assent. This does not mean that we have no rationale to choose one way of action or another; rather, one kind of life or one kind of action cannot be definitively said to be the 'correct' way or action. Instead of a life of inaction, the Skeptic insists that one ought to live according to customs, laws, and traditions. However, this is not always the case. The Skeptics do not dogmatically assert the inability to know anything: the very word skepsis means \"always searching/investigating.\" It would be a contradiction to boldly assert that nothing can be known since that very proposition itself would then be elevated to the status of something which is known.\\n\\n \\n\\n"}

Its formal discovery was announced on August 7, 2000 by a team led by Artie Hatzes, the discoverers gave its mass as 1.2 ± 0.33 times that of Jupiter, with a mean distance of 3.4 AU from the star. Observers, including Geoffrey Marcy suggested that more information on the star's Doppler noise behaviour created by its large and varying magnetic field was needed before the planet could be confirmed. Astrometric measurements made with the Hubble Space Telescope also suggest the existence of the planet. These observations indicated that the planet has a mass 1.5 times that of Jupiter and shares the same plane as the outer dust disk observed around the star. However the derived orbit from these measurements is highly eccentric. This is inconsistent with the presence of an asteroid belt at roughly 3 AU from the star, discovered using observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope: the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and rapidly clear it of material. If a giant planet does exist around Epsilon Eridani with a period similar to the one suggested by the radial velocity observations, its orbit must be nearly circular to avoid disrupting the asteroid belt.\\n\\n"}

He graduated 10th out of a class of 45 in 1832, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery.\\n\\nKeyes served in Charleston Harbor during the nullification crisis of 1832–33, and served as an aide to General Winfield Scott from 1837 to 1841. Keyes was promoted to captain on November 30, 1841. He served in various garrisons until 1844 and then functioned as an artillery and cavalry instructor at West Point. During 1844, he was a member of the Academy's Board of Visitors. \\n\\nAfter his service at West Point, he was then sent with the U.S. 3rd Artillery Regiment in 1854 around Cape Horn to California and served on the Pacific frontier in garrison duty and campaigns until 1860. While there Keyes served in the Pacific Northwest from the winter of 1855 in the Puget Sound War. Keyes's artillery Company M was sent to Fort Steilacoom. While there, in January 1856, he made two attempts to capture Chief Leschi but without success. March 4, 1856, he and 100 Regulars fought a skirmish at the White River and Muckleshoot Prairie. During the Spokane – Coeur d'Alene – Paloos War Captain Keyes was sent ahead with a detachment of dragoons to establish Fort Taylor and a ferry crossing the Snake River for Colonel George Wright's army. In the following campaign he commanded four companies of rifle armed artillerymen against the allied tribes at the Battle of Four Lakes. Shortly after this battle, Keyes received his commission of major on October 12, 1858. General Scott appointed Keyes his military secretary on January 1, 1860, a position Keyes filled until April 1861.\\n\\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, Keyes was promoted to colonel of the 11th U.S. Infantry on May 14, 1861. He then served briefly on the staff of New York Governor Edwin D. Morgan until June 25, 1861, overseeing that state's raising of militia.\\n\\nthumbAt the First Battle of Bull Run, Keyes commanded the 1st Brigade, 1st Division (Tyler), and then led Keyes's Brigade, before assuming command of a division from November 9, 1861, to March 13, 1862. In August 1861 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers with date of rank of May 17, 1861, the third-ranking brigadier general in the Army. He was then given command of IV Corps, leading it from its inception on March 3, 1862, until its discontinuation on August 1, 1863. When Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign against Richmond was organized in the spring of 1862, Keyes led in unexceptionable fashion. \\n\\nKeyes saw action at Lee's Mill, Yorktown, Bottom's Bridge, Savage's Station, Seven Pines (Fair Oaks), Charles City Cross Roads, Malvern Hill, and Harrison's Landing. For gallantry at Fair Oaks, Keyes received the brevet of brigadier general in the regular army. After the Army of the Potomac left the Peninsula, the IV Corps remained behind as a part of Maj. Gen. John Adams Dix's Department of Virginia. On March 12, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Keyes for promotion to the grade of major general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from May 5, 1862 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 13, 1862.. In addition to the IV Corps, he commanded the Yorktown District, VII Corps, and the division at Suffolk. Among Keyes's other actions were the raid to White House, Virginia, on January 7, 1863, and the expedition to West Point, Virginia, on May 7, 1863.\\n\\nDuring the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, Keyes fell afoul of General John Adams Dix's strategic plan to demonstrate heavily against Richmond in order to divert Confederate reinforcements from General Robert E. Lee's army in Pennsylvania. Keyes retreated from a position near what is now Tallysville, Virginia, in the face of what Dix deemed to be inferior forces, so Dix had Keyes removed from command. \\n\\nAlthough Keyes asked for an investigation of the charges that led to his removal, the request was never granted. He then served on various boards and commissions, including the board for retiring disabled officers from July 15, 1863, until his resignation and retirement from the army on May 6, 1864.\\n\\nErasmus D. KeyesFollowing his war service, Keyes moved to San Francisco, where he soon became financially successful and prominent. He converted to Catholicism in San Francisco in 1866. He was president of a Mexican gold mining company in 1867–1869, and vice president of the California vine-culture society from 1868 to 1872. He also was engaged in the savings and loan business. \\n\\nKeyes was the author of The Rear Guard at Malvern Hill as part of The Century Company's Battles and Leaders of the Civil War series, as well as Fifty Years' Observation of Men and Events (New York, 1884). This was later reprinted as Fighting Indians in Washington Territory (Fairfax, Washington, 1988). His work From West Point to California was published posthumously in 1950.\\n\\nWhile on a trip to Europe with his wife, Keyes died in Nice, France, at age 85. He is buried in West Point Cemetery.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Erasmus Reinhold", "body": "Erasmus Reinhold (October 22, 1511 – February 19, 1553) was a German astronomer and mathematician, considered to be the most influential astronomical pedagogue of his generation. He was born and died in Saalfeld, Thuringia, Germany.\\n\\nHe was educated, under Jacob Milich, at the University of Wittenberg, where he was first elected dean and later became rector. In 1536 he was appointed professor of higher mathematics by Philipp Melanchthon. In contrast to the limited modern definition, \"mathematics\" at the time also included applied mathematics, especially astronomy. His colleague, Georg Joachim Rheticus, also studied at Wittenberg and was appointed professor of lower mathematics in 1536.\\n\\nReinhold catalogued a large number of stars. His publications on astronomy include a commentary (1542, 1553) on Georg Purbach's Theoricae novae planetarum. Reinhold knew about Copernicus and his heliocentric ideas prior to the publication of De revolutionibis and made a favourable reference to him in his commentary on Purbach. However, Reinhold (like other astronomers before Kepler and Galileo) translated Copernicus' mathematical methods back into a geocentric system, rejecting heliocentric cosmology on physical and theological grounds. \\n\\nDuke Albert of Brandenburg Prussia supported Reinhold and financed the printing of Reinhold's Prutenicae Tabulae or Prussian Tables. These astronomical tables helped to disseminate calculation methods of Copernicus throughout the Empire, however, Gingerich notes that they showed a \"notable lack of commitment\" to heliocentricity and were \"carefully framed\" to be independent of the movement of the Earth. Both Reinholds's Prutenic Tables and Copernicus' studies were the foundation for the Calendar Reform by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. \\n\\nIt was Reinhold's heavily annotated copy of De revolutionibus in the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh that started Owen Gingerich on his search for copies of the first and second editions which he describes in The Book Nobody Read. In Reinhold's unpublished commentary on De revolutionibus, he calculated the distance from the Earth to the sun. He \"massaged\" his calculation method in order to arrive at an answer close to that of Ptolemy. \\n\\nHis name has been given to a prominent lunar impact crater that lies to the south-southwest of the crater Copernicus, on the Mare Insularum.\\n\\n"}

The corpus spongiosum is a single tubular structure located just below the corpora cavernosa. This may also become slightly engorged with blood, but less so than the corpora cavernosa.\\n\\nErectile tissue is also found in the nose, ear, urethral sponge, perineal sponge, and vestibular bulbs.

It was originally developed under the name iPACKMAN  and based on an earlier compression scheme called PACKMAN.\\n\\nThe original 'ETC1' compression scheme provides 6x compression of 24 bit RGB data. It does not support the compression of images with Alpha components. The 'ETC2' scheme expands ETC1 in a backwards-compatible way to provide higer quality RGB compression, as well as compression of RGBA data (RGB plus alpha).\\n\\nETC1 takes 4x4 groups of pixel data and compresses each into a single 64 bit word. The 4x4 pixel group is first divided into two 4x2 chunks - either horizontally or vertically. Each half is given a base color - either using 4/4/4 RGB or by giving one of them a 5/5/5 RGB and having the other be a 3/3/3 bit offset from that base. Each 4x2 region also has a 3 bit brightness range selection. Each pixel is then offset from the base color by adding one of four signed values to the base color for its half of the 4x4 group.\\n\\nThis format is a part of the OpenGL ES graphics standard for embedded devices such as cellphone and has been approved by the Khronos group for use in the WebGL graphics standard for browser-side world-wide web graphics.\\n\\nA software package called etcpack for compression and decompression of ETC1 textures is available for free download for usage with Khronos APIs.\\n\\nAndroid version 2.2 (Froyo) includes support for ETC1. \\n\\n"}

The Mann home was a gathering-place for intellectuals and artists. She was hired for her first theater engagement before finishing her Abitur at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. \\n\\nIn 1924, she began serious theater studies in Berlin and played in Berlin and Bremen. In 1925, she played in the premier of her brother Klaus' play Anja und Esther.\\n\\nOn July 24, 1926, she married German actor Gustaf Gründgens, but they divorced in 1929. In 1927, she and Klaus undertook a trip around the world, which they documented in their book Rundherum; Das Abenteuer einer Weltreise. The following year, she began to be active in journalism and in politics.\\n\\nShe was involved as an actor in the lesbian film Mädchen in Uniform (1931, Leontine Sagan) but left the production before its completion. In 1932 she published the first of many children's books. Shortly thereafter she became involved in several lesbian affairs in her private life. Her first noted affair was with actress Pamela Wedekind, whom she met in Berlin, and was engaged with her brother Klaus. She later became involved with director Therese Giehse, and journalists Betty Cox and Annemarie Schwarzenbach, whom she served with as a war correspondent during World War II. As was later written, her relationships were both sexually passionate and intellectually stimulating. \\n\\nIn 1933, she, Klaus, and Therese Giehse had founded a cabaret in Munich called Die Pfeffermühle, for which Erika wrote most of the material, much of which was anti-Fascist. Erika was the last member of the Mann family to leave Germany after the Nazi regime was elected. She saved many of Thomas Mann's papers from their Munich home when she escaped to Zurich. In 1936, Die Pfeffermühle opened again in Zurich and became a rallying point for the exiles.\\n\\nIn 1935 she undertook a marriage of convenience to the bisexual English poet W. H. Auden, in order to obtain British citizenship. She and Auden never lived together, but remained friends and technically married until Erika's death.\\n\\nIn 1937, she crossed over to New York, where Die Pfeffermühle (as The Peppermill) opened its doors again. They lived (with Therese Giehse and her brother Klaus Mann and Miró) in a large group of artists in exile with people like Kurt Weill, Ernst Toller, Sonja Sekula ...\\n\\nIn 1938, she and Klaus reported on the Spanish Civil War, and her book School for Barbarians about Nazi Germany's educational system was published. The following year, they published Escape to Life, a book about famous German exiles. During the war, she was active as a journalist in England. After World War II, Mann was one of the few women who covered the Nuremberg Trials. Following the war, both Klaus and Erika came under an FBI investigation into their political views and rumored homosexuality.

A formulaic oath in the Iliad invokes them as \"those who beneath the earth punish whosoever has sworn a false oath\". Burkert suggests they are \"an embodiment of the act of self-cursing contained in the oath\". \\n\\nWhen the mighty Titan Cronus castrated his father Uranus and threw his genitalia into the sea, the Erinyes emerged from the drops of blood, while Aphrodite was born from the crests of seafoam. According to a variant account, they issued from an even more primordial level—from Nyx, \"Night\". Their number is usually left indeterminate. Virgil, probably working from an Alexandria source, recognized three: Alecto (\"unceasing\", who appeared in Virgil's Aeneid), Megaera (\"grudging\"), and Tisiphone (\"avenging murder\"). Dante followed Virgil in depicting the same three-charactered triptych of Erinyes; in Canto IX of the ''Inferno'' they confront the poets at the gates of the city of Dis. The heads of the Erinyes were wreathed with serpent (compare Gorgon) and their eyes dripped with blood, rendering their appearance rather horrific. Other depictions show them with the wings of a bat or bird and the body of a dog. \\n\\nIn Aeschylus's \"Eumenides\", the Erinyes chase Orestes to avenge Clytemnestra, his mother. Orestes killed Clytemnestra to avenge the murder of his father, Agamemnon. The Erinyes chase Orestes to Athens where Athena then intervenes. She and the Athenians judge whether Orestes deserves the wrath of Erinyes and rule in favor of Orestes. Athena, in order to appease the Erinyes, gives them the love of Athens and renames them the Eumenides. The Eumenides are given red robes to replace the black robes they wore for most of the play, drawing an end to the red color scheme that is evident throughout the play. \\n\\n"}

On 25 September 1940, when Josef Terboven assumed full power in the country, Sandberg was named as Minister of Finance. The Norwegian Fascist party Nasjonal Samling had some influence in naming the cabinet ministers, but Sandberg was one of the non-political cabinet members (together with Sigurd Johannessen and Øystein Ravner) as demanded by Reichskommissariat Norwegen. Sandberg was persuaded to join the cabinet, and later supported in daily affairs, by Reichskommissariat since he wanted to limit the cabinet's financial spendings, especially that of the Ministry of the Interior.

The hermitage has since evolved into Ermita Church, which has been rebuilt several times since the early 17th century. \\n\\nErmita gained renewed prominence during the American colonial period. It became known as the university district, containing the campuses of the University of the Philippines, the Ateneo de Manila, the Assumption College and the St. Paul College for girls. Dormitories for students also flourished in the area. The residential portion of Ermita was populated by American residents, who set up such establishments as the Army and Navy Club, and the University Club. \\n\\nDuring the 1945 Battle of Manila, Ermita was the scene of some of the most horrific massacres that occurred during the month of February, 1945. The wife and four children of future President Elpidio Quirino were murdered in Ermita, as was Supreme Court Associate Justice Anacleto Diaz. Between 68% to 85% of Ermita was destroyed during the Battle of Manila, with an estimated total of 100,000 Filipino civilians killed in the city itself. \\n\\nErmita was rebuilt after the devastation of the war. University life remained vibrant therein. However, as decades passed, Ermita started earning a reputation as the red-light district of Manila. During the term of Mayor Alfredo Lim, an effort was made to \"clean up\" Ermita, helping improve its reputation since then. However, a local city ordinance prohibiting the establishment, on grounds of public morality, of motels, lodging houses and other similar establishments, was later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. As a result of the clean-up efforts, nightlife in the area dwindled though it has picked up of late with the help of the emergence of the nearby Malate district and the Roxas Blvd. Baywalk area in the nightlife scene.

He is an American physicist and author, best known for his controversial research on the health risks of low-level radiation from atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons and from nuclear power plants. \\n\\nBoth of Sternglass' parents were Jewish physicians. The Sternglass family left Germany in 1938, when Ernest was fourteen. He completed high school at the age of sixteen, then entered Cornell, registering for an engineering program. His family's financial troubles forced him to leave school for a year; by the time he returned to Cornell, the US had entered World War II. Sternglass volunteered for the navy. He was about to ship out when the atomic bomb was detonated over Hiroshima.\\n\\nAfter the war, Sternglass married. In Washington, D.C. he worked as a civilian employee at the Naval Ordinance Laboratory, which researched military weapons. Sternglass began studying night vision devices, which led him to work with radiation. In 1947, his first son was born, and he got a chance to meet Albert Einstein.\\n\\nFrom 1952 to 1967 Sternglass worked at the Westinghouse Research Laboratory. All his work there involved nuclear instrumentation. At first he studied fluoroscopy, which \"exposes an individual to a considerable dose of radiation.\" Then he worked on a new kind of television tube for satellites. Eventually he was put in charge of the Lunar Station program at Westinghouse.\\n\\nSternglass is Emeritus Professor of Radiological Physics in the Department of Radiology, at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.\\n\\nSternglass is Director, Cofounder, and Chief Technical Officer of the Radiation and Public Health Project (RPHP).\\n\\nIn the early 1960s Professor Sternglass became aware of the work of Dr. Alice Stewart. Stewart was head of the Department of Preventive Medicine of Oxford University, responsible for a pioneering study on the effects of low-level radiation in England. Stewart had discovered that a small amount of radiation to an unborn child could double the child's chances for leukemia and cancer. \\n\\nIn the 1960s, Sternglass studied the effect of nuclear fallout on infants and children. He found not only an increase in leukemia and cancer, but a significant increase in infant mortality. In 1963 he published the paper \"Cancer: Relation of Prenatal Radiation to Development of the Disease in Childhood\" in the journal Science. \\n\\nIn 1963, Professor Sternglass testified before the congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy regarding the level of strontium-90 found in children as part of the Baby Tooth Survey. The result of bomb-test fallout, strontium-90 was associated with increased childhood leukemia. His studies played a role in the Partial Test Ban Treaty signed by President John F. Kennedy. \\n\\nIn 1969, Sternglass reached the conclusion that 400,000 infants had died because of medical problems caused by fallout—chiefly lowered resistance to disease and reductions in birth weight. \\n\\nIn April 1979, Sternglass was invited to testify to Congressional hearings on the Three Mile Island accident. Two days later, when the hearings were moved from the House to the Senate, he was told his testimony was no longer desired. Sternglass believed that an effort was being made to suppress any evidence about possible deaths as a result of the accident. A major study by Sternglass showed that the 1979 accident led to a minimum of 430 infant deaths.\\n\\nSome people have found Sternglass' radiation research to be \"groundbreaking\". However, his research has also been frequently criticized by local, state and federal environmental and health agencies, when the results of his research on the health effects of low level radiation could not be verified by peer review. Sternglass has been accused of using faulty methodology, including selection bias, in his research.\\n\\nProfessor Sternglass has also written a book called Before the Big Bang: the Origins of the Universe, in which he offers an argument for Lemaître's theory of the primeval atom. He offers technical data showing the plausibility of an original super massive relativistic electron-positron pair. This particle contained the entire mass of the universe and through a series of 270 divisions created everything that now exists.

The family lived and ministered in Florida, Maryland, West Virginia, Alabama, and Texas. Ernest was converted to Christ as a teenager in Dallas and immediately began to participate in street meetings, including some at which he dodged rocks and tomatoes. He graduated with a B. A. in Bible from Bob Jones University in 1948, when he was nineteen; and he earned his Th.M. and Th.D. degrees from Dallas Theological Seminary in 1952 and 1957 respectively.\\n\\nIn 1952, Pickering married Ariel Yvonne Thomas, whom he had met as an intern pastor in Colorado City, Texas, and the couple shortly moved to New Kensington, Pennsylvania, where Pickering pastored Maranatha Bible Church.\\n\\nAfter completing his doctorate, Pickering served for two years as the National Executive Secretary for the Independent Fundamental Churches of America (IFCA) and edited its publication, The Voice. In 1959 he became pastor of Woodcrest Baptist Church in Fridley, Minnesota, and served as Dean of Central Baptist Theological Seminary of Minneapolis until 1965. Simultaneously he served on the Board of Trustees for Pillsbury Baptist Bible College and was a founder of Baptist World Mission. From 1965 until 1969, Pickering pastored the Bible Baptist Church of Kokomo, Indiana, became a leader in the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, and wrote adult Sunday School lessons for Regular Baptist Press. In 1969, he accepted the call of Baptist Bible College, Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania to join its faculty and serve as Dean. The following year, he succeeded G.

Pickering provided the necessary maturity and leadership to stabilize the congregation. \\n\\nIn 1986, Pickering became president of Northwest Baptist Seminary, Tacoma, Washington, but following a disagreement over what its board of trustees considered an overly strict position on ecclesiastical separation, Pickering resigned in 1987. For a year he returned to Baptist Bible Seminary as professor of theology, and in 1988, he was called to the pastorate of Fourth Baptist Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota, an especially influential fundamentalist church because it was the home of Central Baptist Theological Seminary—of which Pickering also assumed the presidency. \\n\\nIn 1993, Pickering was named “Alumnus of the Year” by Bob Jones University. The same year he accepted the call of Baptist World Mission, serving as Deputation Director, 1993-1996, and field representative from 1996 until his death in 2000. \\n\\nIn 1983, Pickering was stricken with cancer in the frontal sinuses near his brain. In 1996 he experienced a recurrence, and the radiation used to treat the cancer caused him to become totally blind on November 8, 1996. Assisted by his wife, Pickering continued to preach without notes until the progress of the disease made continuation of his ministry impossible. Pickering wrote his final booklet, Our Tear-Washed Eyes: Why Does God Allow His People to Suffer? after he had lost his sight.\\n\\nPickering criticized the ecumenical neo-evangelism of Billy Graham in print as early as 1957, and his chief contribution to twentieth-century evangelical Christianity was as a Baptist theoretician of separatist fundamentalism.\\n\\n"}

Sipes has also published on the impact of progressive Napoleonic era French political and social reforms reproduced by Russia in Alaska.\\n\\nErnest Sipes was born in Fairbanks, Alaska on October 14, 1957. He was raised in North Pole, Alaska. Sipes' father served in World War II as a Drill Instructor in the United States Army. Sipes' mother died in 1967, and his father remarried in 1969.\\n\\nSipes grew up with Athabascans and Inuit Natives. He is known as one of a very few non G'wichin Indians to have lived on the Venetie Indian Reservation in the 1990s. While living on the reservation he was noted as having some abilities as a hunter, harvesting bear and moose with tribesmen from the village. He worked as a Mental Health Counselor in Fairbanks, Alaska for over 16 years, was briefly employed in the State of Alaska Department of Administration and has since been working as an English teacher in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nSipes was married in 2000 to a member of the Wai-Wai tribe from NE Brasil. He was divorced in 2008. He currently lives in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nSipes graduated from High School in 1976. He attended both the University of Alaska and Brigham Young University. He graduated from college with a B.A. in British Literature from Brigham Young University in 1991. Sipes completed a teaching degree while attending Brigham Young and taught high school English Literature courses in Hawaii and was a substitute teacher in Alaska during the 1990s.\\n\\nSipes says he worked drilling water wells on the island of Oahu in 1988 while attending Brigham Young University, which involved field work. While surveying in the Makaha Valley he discovered several burial mounds of ancient Hawaiians which were reported to the University of Hawaii Manoa.\\n\\nIn February, 1998 he transported a FOLBOT collapsible kayak to Rio Negro in the Brazilian Amazon and ascended the river 200 miles. On this expedition, Sipes was by all accounts the first outsider to paddle up the Camanai River, where after contacting the Waimiri-Atroari Indians he was forced to leave the tribal area. In March, 1999 Sipes made the first documented attempt to walk overland between the two major rivers of South America, namely the Amazonas (Solimoes) and Rio Negro river systems. After six days and walking thirty miles, east of the Japura River he contracted Dengue Fever in a swamp and abandoned the trek. In May, 2000 he and his Wai Wai wife Marineth (Natchee) and a two man crew attempted to enter Guyana from the south by traveling north on the Mapura River, but were stopped by waterfalls when the boat swamped near the equator. In February, 2002 he contacted the Pacaja Indians off the Xingu River which was documented in Brazzil magazine in 2004.\\n\\nSipes visited Egypt to research the ancient caravan routes of northwest Egypt in 2001, 2003, 2004 and in March 2008. He led approximately ten overland expeditions from Siwa to the various abandoned oases in the western desert, documenting the sites for publication. In May 2004 he is reported to have walked alone from the Egyptian border several miles into Libya following a camel track while searching for an unnamed abandoned oasis after his Bedouin guide refused to accompany him due the possibility of arrest.\\n\\nIn December, 2005 Sipes made the first ascent by kayak in the Likouala District of the Ubangui River and the Ibenga River in the Republic of Congo. At the time of this trip several different factions of rebels were active along the Ubangui River, which constitutes the border between the Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. Little information is available about this remote area which is not accessible by road. In 2006, Mr. Sipes worked for the United States Embassy in the Republic of Congo preparing two security reports. The first report documented security issues in the Likoluala District between ROC and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and was completed under the direction of U.S. Charge d'Affaires Mark Beidlingmaier. In the second report, prepared at the request of then U.S. Ambassador Robert Weisberg, Sipes completed the first English language security report on the CFCO railroad operating between Point Noire and Brazzaville.\\n\\nOver August-September 2008, Sipes traveled to the Republic of Georgia during the period of the Russia invasion of the South Ossetian War. While in the country he was in the town of Gori at the time of the pull-out of the Russian army and wrote an article documenting the event for Georgia Today, Georgia's largest circulation English language journal.\\n\\nErnest Sipes's work has been published in History Today magazine (United Kingdom) and Brazzil magazine (Brazil and United States). He has also published a book with Hancock House publishers (Canada). The majority of Sipes' published work focuses on Native Americans and South American Indians. Sipes has pioneered several areas of research focusing on Indigenous Peoples. He has also published original research in 1998 and 2007 which documented the impact of the institution of serfdom as applied to Alaskan Natives by the Russians. In 2003, Sipes produced the first scholarly account of the current living conditions and conducted limited anthropological fieldwork with the Poticru Tribe of the Xingu River.\\n\\nhttp://www.brazzillog.com/2003/html/news/articles/aug03/p118aug03.htm\\n\\nhttp://www.georgiatoday.ge/article_details.php?id=5633\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ernest Zobole", "body": "Ernest Zobole (25 April 1927 – 27 November 1999) was a Welsh painter and art teacher. Zobole's paintings, originally oil on canvas, later switching to oil on board, reflected the industrial setting of the Rhondda Valleys. A member of the Rhondda Group, a circle of artists from the area, Zobole is seen as one of Wales' \"most important artists...one of the visionary artists of Wales\".\\n\\nZobole was born in the village of Ystrad in 1927, to Italian immigrants who had moved to Wales in 1910. He was educated at Porth Grammar School, before spending five years training at the Cardiff College of Art. His time at Cardiff College was notable for the daily commute from the Valleys to Cardiff, as it was used as an opportunity for Zobole and five fellow students to discuss and critique their art work. Although the six artists never set up a school or published a manifesto, they became known as the Rhondda Group and were an important movement in South Wales art.\\n\\nAfter leaving Cardiff College, he undertook his service for the British Army, being posted to Palestine and Egypt. On his return from military service he returned to the Rhondda and married his childhood sweetheart, Christine Baker. With little opportunities to find work as an artist, Zobole took up an art teaching post in Llangefni in Anglesey, a position he held from 1953 to 1958. He found this period difficult, he found the flat landscapes dull and uninspiring and described the island as \"all wind and chapel\". Zobole also felt apart from the community, a mixture of his inability to speak the Welsh language; which was not a factor in the mainly English speaking Rhondda, and a sense of homesickness. He returned to South Wales in 1957, taking up a post at a Church in Wales school in Aberdare, located in the Cynon Valley a neighbouring valley to the Rhondda. Within two years he found employment teaching within the Rhondda, at Treorchy County Secondary School.\\n\\nInitially Zobole painted as he had been taught at college, but by 1960 he started to experiment with his own style. He originally painted oil on canvas, but he then switched to oil on board and started to use a monochrome colours. He began using impasto, mainly applied with a palette knife. His period of work during the mid 1960s are now regarded as the most daring phase of his career. Zobole was influenced during the 1960s by expressionist refugee artists such as Heinz Koppel, who had a studio in Dowlais. \\n\\nFrom 1963 to 1984 he became a painting lecturer at Newport Art School. In 1996, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the University of Wales, Swansea. Although Zobole lived and worked in a number of places in Wales, he spent most of his life in Ystrad Rhondda, where he died in 1999. \\n\\nZobole described his ethos to painting as: \"Painting is a part of my life...your breathing I suppose...it is part of what you're about...part of your thinking. It sounds a bit lofty to say that this thing called painting is the whole reason for existing, and if I say yes it is, then accept the fact that I have a lofty thought. The imagery for the work is taken from my immediate surroundings - the house, the outside landscape, and the landscape seen through doors and windows. The outside and inside come together in places. The system used in painting parallels one we use naturally, in that when we examine any situation, we look around or turn our heads, or move our eyes, or more likely, do all three. The differing viewpoints we take in help us build some kind of picture. In making use of these differing viewpoints, plan views, side elevations, end elevations and perspectives are used; eye levels vary, scale varies and emphasis varies; there is also time and memory\".\\n\\nThe National Museum of Wales holds ten pieces of work by Zobole, including People and Ystrad Rhondda (1961) and Some Trees and Snow (1978).\\n\\n"}

Degner raced successfully for the competitive East German manufacturer MZ which used two-stroke engines, for which MZ's engineer Walter Kaaden discovered principles regarding how sound waves and expansion chamber affect engine tuning. \\n\\nAfter the Berlin Wall had been built in August 1961, Degner arranged the escape (Republikflucht) of his family from the GDR in the boot (trunk) of a car on the weekend he himself was racing in the Swedish Grand Prix at Kristianstad. In that race he could have secured the 125cc World Championship for himself and for MZ, but his engine failed early in the race. Ironically, his main rival for the 125cc World Title, Tom Phillis (Honda), also failed to finish the Swedish race.\\n\\nIt was after the race, when he was able to drive out of the circuit, that Ernst Degner defected by driving his Wartburg car to West Germany via Denmark. \\n\\nAfter the MZ team had discovered his defection, the East Germans falsely accused Degner of deliberately destroying his engine in the Swedish race. This was a crazy accusation since having started the race, Degner surely wanted to win it - and the 125cc World Title - as much as MZ. However, the East Germans' accusations resulted in Degner's racing licence being revoked. This prevented him from racing a borrowed EMC 125cc racer in the final 125cc World Championship round in Argentina. Had he won that race, he could still have been crowned 125cc World Champion.\\n\\nIn November, the Japanese company Suzuki hired him and he moved to Hamamatsu, Japan to work in the Suzuki race-shop over the winter. Using the specialist two-stroke knowledge he had gained at MZ, Degner designed Suzuki's new 50cc and 125cc racers.\\n\\nThe following year, in 1962 Degner won Suzuki's first World Championship in the 50&nbsp;cc class.\\n\\nIn November 1963, Degner crashed his Suzuki 250cc racer at the Japanese Grand Prix held at the Suzuka Circuit. The fuel tank burst into flames and Degner suffered horrific burns which required over fifty skin grafts.

He began working as a doctor of ophthalmology at the university of Würzburg, but then moved to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Kiel, where he published papers on cancer metastasis (the \"Gräfenberg theory\"), and the physiology of egg implantation. In 1910 Gräfenberg worked as a gynaecologist in Berlin, and by 1920 was most successful, with an office on the Kurfurstendamm. He was chief gynecologist of a municipal hospital in Britz, a working class Berlin district, and was beginning scientific studies of the physiology of human reproduction at Berlin University. \\n\\nDuring the First World War, he was a medical officer, and continued publishing papers, mostly on human female physiology. In 1929 he published his studies of the \"Gräfenberg ring\", the first IUD for which there are usage records.\\n\\nWhen Nazism assumed power in Germany, Gräfenberg, a Jew, was forced in 1933 to resign as head of the department of gynaecology and obstetrics in the Berlin-Britz municipal hospital. In 1934, Hans Lehfeldt attempted to persuade him to leave Nazi Germany; he refused, believing that since his practice included wives of high Nazi officials, he would be safe. He was wrong, and was arrested in 1937 for having smuggled out a valuable stamp from Germany.

{"title": "Ernst May", "body": "300px\\n\\nErnst May (27 July 1886, Frankfurt am Main—11 September 1970, Hamburg) was a German architect and city planner.\\n\\nMay successfully applied urban design techniques to the city of Frankfurt am Main during Germany's Weimar period, and in 1930 less successfully exported those ideas to Soviet Union cities, newly created under Stalinist rule. It is said May's \"brigade\" of German architects and planners established twenty cities in three years, including Magnitogorsk. May's travels left him a stateless person when the Nazis seized German rule, and he spent many years in Africa exile before returning to Germany near the end of his life.\\n\\nMay was born as the son of a leather goods manufacturer. His education from 1908 through 1912 included time in the United Kingdom, studying under Raymond Unwin, and absorbing the lessons and principles of the garden city movement. He finished a study at the Technical University of Munich, working with Friedrich von Thiersch and Theodor Fischer, a co-founder of the Deutscher Werkbund. \\n\\nWorking for himself and others through the 1910s, in 1921 he helped win a competition for rural housing estate developments in Breslau. His concepts of decentralized planning, some of which had been imported from the garden city movement, he won the job of city architect and planner for his home city from 1925 through 1930. Working under Mayor Ludwig Landmann, the position gave him broad powers of zoning, financing, and hiring. There was copious funding and an available labor pool. He used them. thumb\\n\\nIn the context of a housing shortage and a degree of political instability, May assembled a powerful staff of progressive architects and initiated a large-scale housing development program. May's developments were remarkable for the time for being compact, semi-independent, well-equipped with community elements like playgrounds, schools, theatres, and common washing areas. For the sake of economy and construction speed May used simplified, prefabricated forms. These settlements are still marked by their functionality and the way they manifest egalitarian ideals such as equal access to sunlight, air, and common areas. Of these settlements the best known is probably Römerstadt, and some of the structures are colloquially known as Zickzackhausen. \\n\\nIn 1926 May sent for Austria architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky to join him in Frankfurt. Lihotsky was a kindred spirit and applied the same sort of functional clarity to household problems, and so in Frankfurt, after much analysis of work habits and footsteps, she developed the prototype of the modern installed kitchen, and pursued her idea that \"housing is the organized implementation of living habits\". \\n\\nMay's Frankfurt was a civic and critical success. This has been described (by John R. Mullin) as \"one of the most remarkable city planning experiments in the twentieth century\". In two years May produced more than 5,000 building units, up to 15,000 units in five years, published his own magazine (Zeitschrift Das Neue Frankfurt) and in 1929 won international attention at the Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne. This also brought him to the attention of the Soviet Union.\\n\\nIn 1930 May took virtually his entire Frankfurt staff to Russia. May's Brigade amounted to a task force of 17 people, including Lihotsky, her husband Wilhelm Schuette, Arthur Korn, the Hungarian-born Fred Forbat, the Swiss Hans Schmidt, the Austrian-born Erich Mauthner and the Dutch Mart Stam. The promise of the \"Socialist paradise\" was still fresh, and May's Brigade and other groups of western planners had the hope of constructing entire cities. The first was to be Magnitogorsk. Although May's group is indeed credited with building 20 cities in three years, the reality was that May found Magnitogorsk already under construction and the town site dominated by the mine. Officials were indecisive, then distrustful, corruption and delay frustrated their efforts, and May himself made misjudgements about the climate. May's contract expired in 1933, and he left for British East Africa (Kenya). Some of his architects found themselves unwanted by Russia, and stateless. \\n\\nThe 1995 documentary film Sotsgorod (\"Socialist Cities\") interviewed some of the last survivors of these groups: Lihotzky, Jan Rutgers, and Phillipp Tolziner of the Bauhaus Brigade, and visited four of the planned cities: Magnitogorsk, Orsk, Novokuznetsk and Kemerovo. \\n\\nMay worked, farmed and completed some architectural work in Kenya, then returned to Germany after the end of World War II. From 1954 through 1956 he led the planning department in Hamburg, was involved in several large housing projects in other cities, and died in 1970.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Erotic electrostimulation", "body": "thumbErotic electrostimulation (abbreviated e-stim and also known as electrosex) is a human sexual practice involving the application of electrical stimulation to the nerv of the body, with particular emphasis on the genitals, using a power source (such as a TENS, EMS, Violet wand, or made-for-play units) for purposes of sexual stimulation. Electrostimulation has been associated with BDSM activities, and erotic electrostimulation is an evolution of that practice. Erotic electrostimulation is the use of electrostimulation in an erotic or sexual manner versus the more sadistic or painful applications in BDSM.\\n\\nElectrostimulation can cause tissue damage or even death if misused. The most common problems arising from electrostimulation tend to be burn from lack of lubrication or bad contact between the electrode and the skin's surface. Even at relatively low current and voltage, there is also risk of interference with normal heart function (potentially including cardiac arrest), and this risk is higher for those who use an artificial pacemaker or similar device or who have heart conditions. Because of this, it is not advisable to place the electrical contacts in such a way that current passes through the chest cavity. Newcomers are encouraged to research the hazards, limitations, and techniques of electrostimulation and the devices used.\\n\\nThe use of electricity for entertainment purposes dates back at least as early as the 1740s. In the 1830s, insertable electrode attachments for small magnetos could be purchased. Later in the 1800s, various electric belts (some complete with \"suspensory sack\") were advertised as cures for impotence. In the 1920s, the American Medical Association investigated such devices, and concluded that they provided \"more or less mechanical masturbation\".\\n\\nModern electrostimulation first became recognized during the 1950s with the introduction of a device called the Relaxacisor, which was originally designed to stimulate the muscles of a relaxing subject using electric currents as a means of \"passive exercise.\" Such power sources are still in medical use today and are known as EMS (electrical muscle stimulation) units. Some people soon found alternative uses for the Relaxacisors by placing the contacts on sexual parts of the body.\\n\\nBy the 1970s, medical TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) units were also being used for electrostimulation. However, neither the EMS nor medical TENS units were ideal for erotic purposes, and in the 1980s the first devices manufactured specifically for erotic electrostimulation became available, in particular the Titillator and the Pleasure Box, later known as the PES Power Box.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, experimenters noticed that bare speaker wires could deliver a jolt and began using recorded and live sound for electrostimulation. At that time, there were no professionally made attachments for such play, so people built their own out of copper plumbing parts and other metal pieces with attention to resistor placed in series with the human parts to control the current for safety. Although early e-stim units used only a simple, pulsed, sinusoidal wave, newer units (such as the ErosTek 312) use more complex wave form and also allow for the use of ambient sound or prerecorded wave forms like music or specially designed computer files for specific types of stimulation. There are now sites dedicated to the creation of MP3 files specifically for erotic journeys or symphonies, which can include such routines as rewards, punishments, very strong, and pleasantly soft portions.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThere are repackaged TENS and EMS units marketed as erotic electrostimulation power sources. Medical TENS units are designed to desensitize nerves (for pain management), and though they can be used for sexual electrostimulation purposes, most people do not find the sensation they produce especially erotic.  Medical EMS units are designed to cause muscle contraction and are also far from optimal for erotic use. \\n\\nAn increasing number of \"body toner\" or \"electromassage\"-type power sources are being marketed directly to consumers. Like medical units, these types of power sources were not designed for sexual use. They vary widely in quality and capabilities and most have the incorrect power and frequency output for erotic electrostimulation.\\n\\nSome people may try to craft a \"homemade\" electrostimulation power sources, or adapt or modify commercial products (such as a Hifi or DVD system) that were never intended for electrostimulation of the human body. These are dangerous practices; such improvised devices not specifically designed for use on the human body can easily cause injury.\\n\\nDeaths have been reported by using a power strip (with switch) plugged into the mains and connected to the nipples.\\n\\nErotic electrostimulation power sources are specifically designed and manufactured for erotic use on the human body. The first analog devices became popular during the mid-1980s, and during the late 1990s digital devices also became available. Both types usually allow for adjustments of frequency and power output levels, some with complex preset \"programs\" and computer controls. The setups usually consist of a \"box\" and electrodes connected by wiring. Many of the boxes are portable and can be powered by batteries or come with built-in rechargeable batteries. Some units can be connected to remote operators via an Internet-connected computer or controlled via radio frequency key fob.\\n\\nThere are other medical methods that have led to patent filings, such as the discovery that placing electrodes in the spinal cord can induce pleasurable feelings leading to orgasm. There are also various apparatuses, with external or internal stimulation.\\n\\nOther kinds of apparatus use interferential currents with four surface electrodes to replace the internal electrodes.\\n\\nAn electrode is used to deliver the actual electrostimulation to the body.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nFor erotic electrostimulation, these are typically items designed to be applied to the genitals such as vaginal plug and shields, anal plug, probes to directly stimulate the prostate, testicle rings, CBT boards, cock ring, urethral probes, and other items for penile application. The pads used with TENS units are also used in the sexual application of electrostimulation. There are also electrified nipple and breast electrodes available, but there is disagreement within the e-stim community about their safety.\\n\\nThe electrodes can be made of metal such as gold, silver, aluminum, and stainless steel. There are also electrodes made out of conductive silicone. Conductive rubber is a cheap, flexible and efficient option. Electrodes can also be created by modifying medical machinery, telephone electromagnet and other devices that are electrical sources.\\n\\nLubrication plays an important role in the success of erotic electrostimulation since without it, there is a greater risk of high-frequency epidermal burn. Water-based lubricants are generally recommended, although olive oil is popular because it does not dry out as water-based lubricants can. Typically it is recommended to avoid any lubricant that contains silicone since it is an insulator and hence reduces conductivity. Practitioners of electrostimulation select lubricants for compatibility with the material of the electrodes, as well as for desirable conductive properties, which can maximize the strength and quality of the signal.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Escape from New York", "body": "Escape from New York is a 1981 American science fiction action film directed and scored by John Carpenter. He also co-wrote the screenplay with Nick Castle. The film is set in the near future in a crime-ridden United States that has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into a maximum security prison. Ex-soldier and legendary fugitive \"Snake\" Plissken (Kurt Russell) is given 24 hours to find the President of the United States, who has been captured by inmates after Air Force One crashed on the island.\\n\\nCarpenter originally wrote the film in the mid-1970s as a reaction to the Watergate scandal, but no studio wanted to make it because Carpenter proved unable to articulate just how this film could relate to the Watergate scandal. After the success of Halloween, he had enough influence to get the film made and shot most of it in St. Louis, Missouri, where significant portions of the city were used in place of New York City.\\n\\nThe film's total budget was estimated to be US$6 million. It was a commercial hit, grossing over $50 million worldwide. It has since developed its own cult following, particularly around the anti-hero Plissken. A sequel, Escape from L.A., was released in 1996.\\n\\nIn a dystopia 1997, World War III is nearing an end. Both the United States and Soviet Union have suffered greatly in the conflict and are looking for a peaceful resolution. Due to a nationwide crime increase of 400%, Manhattan was turned into one giant maximum security prison for the entire US in 1988. Surrounded by a 50 foot containment wall, and mines on all bridges and patrolled waterways, nobody is allowed in the prison, not even guards. Because there are no guards inside the prison there are only \"prisoners and the worlds they have made. The rules are simple: once you go in, you don't come out.\" \\n\\nTravelling to a three-way summit between the United States, the Soviet Union and China, Air Force One, the plane of the President of the United States, is hijacked by a lone member of a left-wing revolutionary organization, called the National Liberation Front of America, opposed to the government. The militant terrorist, disguised as a stewardess, crashes the plane into Manhattan, but the President (Donald Pleasence) is placed in an escape pod and survives. The inmates quickly find him and take him hostage, cutting off one of his fingers to present as evidence and ordering all United States Police Force officers to leave Manhattan immediately or they will kill him.\\n\\nUSPF Commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) offers a deal to a newly arrived prisoner, an infamous special forces-soldier-turned-criminal named \"Snake\" Plissken (Kurt Russell) who was apprehended after robbing the Federal Reserve Depository. If Snake rescues the president, and retrieves a cassette tape that contains important information on nuclear fusion, Hauk will give him a full pardon. However, Plissken must complete his mission before the international summit that the President was due to attend, which begins in 24 hours. By the time Plissken has reluctantly agreed to attempt the rescue, Hauk has discreetly (Snake is told he is being injected with something routine) had him injected with microscopic explosives that will rupture his carotid arteries once 24 hours have passed. The explosives cannot be defused until within 15 minutes before detonation, as a way of ensuring that Snake does not abandon his mission and escape, or find another way to remove them. If he returns with the President and the tape in time for the summit, Hauk will save him. Snake promises to kill Hauk when he returns.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nSnake covertly lands atop the World Trade Center in a glider, and then locates the hijacked plane wreckage and the escape pod, but the President is gone. Snake tracks the President's life-monitor bracelet signal to the basement of a dilapidated theater, only to find it on the wrist of an incoherent old man (George \"Buck\" Flower). He meets a friendly inmate nicknamed \"Cabbie\" (Ernest Borgnine), who offers to help. Cabbie takes Snake to see Harold 'Brain' Close (Harry Dean Stanton), a savvy and well-educated inmate who has made the New York Public Library his personal fortress. Brain, who knows Snake from some heists they did in the past, tells Snake that the self-proclaimed \"Duke of New York\" (Isaac Hayes), the leader of the Gypsies, the largest and most powerful gang in Manhattan, has the President and plans to lead a mass escape across the mined and heavily guarded 69th Street Bridge, using the President as a human shield. When the Duke unexpectedly arrives to obtain a diagram of the bridge's land mines, Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau) to lead him back to the Duke's compound at Grand Central Station. Snake finds the President being held in a railroad car, but his rescue fails and he is captured after Brain apparently betrays Snake.\\n\\nWhile Snake is forced to fight with a giant brute (Ox Baker), Brain and Maggie trick the Duke's men into letting them have access to the President. After killing the guards, they free the President and flee to Snake's glider. Meanwhile, Snake defeats his opponent. When the Duke learns the President has escaped with Brain, he is furious, and he rounds up his gang to chase them down. In the confusion, Snake slips away and manages to catch up with Brain, Maggie and the President at the glider, but during their attempted getaway, a gang of inmates push it off the building. Snake and the others soon find Cabbie, and Snake takes the wheel of his cab, heading for the bridge. When Cabbie reveals that he has the nuclear fusion tape, the President demands it, but Snake takes it.\\n\\nWith the Duke chasing in another car, Snake and the others drive over the mine-strewn bridge. After the taxi hits a land mine, the cab is destroyed and Cabbie is killed. As the others flee on foot, Brain is killed by a mine and Maggie refuses to leave him. She attempts to hold off the Duke's car by firing at him with a revolver, but he crashes into Maggie and kills her, and continues on foot. Snake and the President reach the containment wall, and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke then attacks Snake, but the President shoots the Duke, killing him. Snake is then lifted to safety, and the explosives implanted in his body are deactivated with seconds to spare.\\n\\nAs the President prepares for a televised speech, he distractedly thanks Snake for saving him. Snake asks him how he feels about the people who died saving his life, but the President only offers half-hearted regret that visibly disgusts Snake. The President's speech commences and he offers the content of the cassette to the summit; but to the President's embarrassment, the tape has been switched for a cassette of the swing song \"Bandstand Boogie\" (the theme from American Bandstand), Cabbie's favorite song. After Snake is pardoned, he decides he will not kill Hauk at this time and leaves the prison, tearing apart the all-important nuclear fusion tape and smiling as he leaves.\\n\\nCarpenter originally wrote the screenplay for Escape from New York in 1976, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, \"The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the President. I wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it\" because, according to Carpenter, \"it was too violent, too scary, too weird.\" He has also been inspired by the film Death Wish which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy but liked how it conveyed \"the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and I wanted to make a science fiction film along these lines\".\\n\\nAvco-Embassy Pictures, the film's financial backer, preferred either Charles Bronson or Tommy Lee Jones to play the role of \"Snake\" Plissken to Carpenter's choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome his \"lightweight\" screen image which arose from his roles in several Disney comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as \"a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of Bruce Lee, The Exterminator, and Darth Vader, with Eastwood's vocal-ness.\" All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is \"the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is.\"\\n\\nCarpenter had just made Dark Star but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed that he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making Escape later. After the success of Halloween, Avco-Embassy signed him and producer Debra Hill to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was The Fog. Initially, the second film that he was going to make to finish the contract was The Philadelphia Experiment, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that something was missing and recalls, \"This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see.\" He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film school days at University of Southern California who also played \"The Shape\" in Halloween. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.\\n\\nThe film's setting proved to be a potential problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on only a shoe-string budget. He and the film's production designer, Joe Alves rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot but Alves nixed that idea \"because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot.\" They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and also associate producer), \"on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America,\" producer Debra Hill remembers.\\n\\nBernardi suggested East St. Louis, Illinois, because it was filled with old buildings \"that exist in New York now, and [that] have that seedy run-down quality\" that the team was looking for. East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous St. Louis, Missouri, had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, \"block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away.\" As well, Alves found an old bridge to double for the \"69th St. Bridge\". The filmmaker purchased the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them for a dollar, \"so that they wouldn't have any liability,\" Hill remembers. Locations across the river in St. Louis, Missouri were also used, including Union Station and the Fox Theater, both of which have since been renovated.\\n\\nCarpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. \"We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the Sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange.\"\\n\\nThe gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, \"That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [spiked] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape.\" In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter also shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a soundstage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York also served as a location, as did Atlanta, in order to utilize their then futuristic-looking rapid-transit system.\\n\\nWhen it came to shooting in New York City Carpenter managed to persuade the city officials to grant access to Liberty Island. \"We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble.\"\\n\\nCarpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie. \"One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England.\"\\n\\nthumbCertain matte paintings were rendered by James Cameron, who was at the time a special effects artist with Roger Corman's New World Pictures.\\n\\nAs Snake pilots the glider into the city there are three screens on his control panel displaying wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. What appears on those screens was not computer generated. Carpenter wanted hi-tech computer graphics which were very expensive at the time, even for such a simple animation. To get the animation he wanted the effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape shows up and appears to be a 3D wireframe animation.\\n\\nEscape from New York grossed $25.2 million in American theatres in summer 1981 with a comparable gross in the international market, resulting in a $50 million box office, a revenue-production ratio of almost 7:1. The film received generally positive reviews. It received a rating of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes. Newsweek magazine commented on Carpenter, saying, \"[He has a] deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility - which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. He uses Russell well, however.\" In Time magazine, Richard Corliss wrote, \"John Carpenter is offering this summer's moviegoers a rare opportunity: to escape from the air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia. It's a trip worth taking.\" Vincent Canby, in his review for the New York Times, wrote, \"[The film] is not to be analyzed too solemnly, though. It's a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season.\" However, in his review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr, wrote \"it fails to satisfy–it gives us too little of too much.\"\\n\\nCyberpunk pioneer William Gibson credits the film as an influence on his novel Neuromancer. \"I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake 'You flew the Gulffire over Leningrad, didn't you?' It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot.\" Popular videogame director Hideo Kojima has referred to the movie frequently as an influence on his work, in particular the Metal Gear series. The character Solid Snake is strongly based on Snake Plissken. In Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Snake actually uses the alias \"Pliskin\" to hide his real identity during the game. J.J. Abrams, producer of the 2008 film Cloverfield, mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for Escape from New York. Empire magazine ranked Snake Plissken #71 in their \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" poll.\\n\\nEscape from New York was released on DVD twice by MGM (USA), and once by Momentum Pictures (UK). One MGM release is a barebones edition containing just the theatrical trailer. Another version is the Collector's Edition, a two-disc set featuring a remastered transfer with a 5.1 audio track, two commentaries (one by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, another by producer Debra Hill and Joe Alves), a making-of featurette, the first issue of a comic book series titled John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, and a ten-minute deleted opening sequence.\\n\\nMGM's special edition of the 1981 film was not released until 2003 because the original negative had disappeared. The workprint containing deleted scenes finally turned up in the Hutchinson, Kansas salt mine film depository. The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: \"After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there.\" The film has also been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.\\n\\nleft\\n\\nIn 1981, Bantam Books published a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style reminiscent of the film. The novel is significant because it includes scenes that were cut out of the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel also provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk — both disillusioned war veterans — deepening their relationship that was only hinted at it in the film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel also fleshes out the world that these characters exist in, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the west coast is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.\\n\\nScottish actor Gerard Butler was close to signing a deal where he would play Snake Plissken in a remake of Carpenter's movie. Neal Moritz was to produce and Ken Nolan was to write the screenplay which would combine an original story for Plissken with the story from the 1981 movie, although Carpenter has hinted that the film might be a prequel.\\n\\nNew Line Cinema (one-time video distributor of the original) acquired the rights to the film from co-rights holder StudioCanal, who will control the European rights, and Carpenter, who will serve as an executive producer and said, \"Snake is one of my fondest creations. Kurt Russell did an incredible job, and it would be fun to see someone else try.\" Russell has also commented on the remake and on the casting of Butler as Plissken, saying, \"I will say that when I was told who was going to play Snake Plissken, my initial reaction was 'Oh, man!' [Russell winces]. I do think that character was quintessentially one thing. And that is, American.\" Len Wiseman was attached to direct but he dropped out of the project and rumors were that Brett Ratner would helm the film. Since Ratner has not formally committed to the new project, the identity of the director is as yet unclear. The studio has brought Jonathan Mostow in to rewrite, with an option to direct. In addition, Gerard Butler has bowed out of his role claiming \"creative differences\". Allan Loeb wrote currently the script for the New Line Cinema project. Breck Eisner has been announced as the director of the remake. The film will not feature a post apocalyptic New York like the original did, rather the New York in the new film will have been built after the bomb.\\n\\nIn November of 2010, reports cited Jeremy Renner as being in talks to play Snake Plissken.  Reports also suggest that Josh Brolin has also been considered to play Snake Plissken.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Escuadrón 201", "body": "El Escuadrón 201 was a Mexican fighter squadron, part of the Fuerza Aérea Expedicionaria Mexicana (FAEM — \"Mexican Expeditionary Air Force\") that aided the Allied war effort during World War II. The squadron was commonly known, apparently coined by members of the squadron during training, by the nickname Aguilas Aztecas, or \"Aztec Eagles\".\\n\\nThe squadron was attached to the 58th Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces during the liberation of the main Philippine island of Luzon in the summer of 1945. The pilots flew P-47D-30-RA \"Thunderbolt\" single-seat fighter aircraft carrying out tactical air support missions. \\n\\nEscuadrón Aéreo de Pelea 201 (201st Air Fighter Squadron) was composed of more than 300 volunteers—30 experienced pilots and the rest ground crewmen. The ground crewmen were electrician, mechanic, and radiomen.\\n\\nTheir formation was prompted by the attack by German submarine against Mexican oil tankers, Potrero del Llano and Faja de Oro, that were transporting crude oil to the United States. These attacks prompted President Manuel Avila Camacho to declare war on the Axis powers.\\n\\nThe squadron left Mexico for training at the United States on July 24, 1944, arrived at Laredo, Texas, on July 25, and moved on to Randolph Field in San Antonio, where they received medical examinations and weapons and flight proficiency admission tests. They received three months of training at Randolph, Foster Army Air Field in Victoria, Texas, and Pocatello Army Air Base. The pilots received extensive training in armament, communications and tactics.\\n\\nThey arrived at Majors Field in Greenville, Texas on November 30, 1944. Here, the pilots received advanced training in combat air tactics, formation flying and gunnery. The men were honored with graduation ceremonies on February 20, 1945 and presented with their battle flag. This marked the first time Mexican troops were trained for overseas combat. In charge of the group was Colonel Antonio Cárdenas Rodríguez, andCaptain First Class Radamés Gaxiola Andrade was named squadron commander.\\n\\nBefore leaving to the Philippines, the men received further instructions and physical examinations in Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California, in March 1945. The men left for the Philippines on the troop ship S.S. Fairisle on March 27, 1945. They arrived in Manila on April 30, 1945, and were assigned as part of the Fifth Air Force, attached to the U.S. 58th Fighter Group, based at Porac, Luzon.\\n\\nBeginning in June 1945, the squadron initially flew missions with the 310th Fighter Squadron, often twice a day, using borrowed U.S. aircraft. It received 25 new P-47D-30-RA aircraft in July, marked with the insignia of both the USAAF and Mexican Air Force. The squadron flew more than 90 combat missions, totaling more than 1,900 hours of flight time. They participated in the Allied effort to bomb Luzon and Formosa to push the Japan out of those islands. During their fighting in the Philippines, five pilots died (one was shot down, one crashed, and three ran out of fuel and died at sea), and three others died in accidents during training.\\n\\nAmong the missions flown by the squadron was 53 ground support missions flown in support of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division together with the Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers and recognized guerrilla units in its break-out into the Cagayan Valley on Luzon between 4 June and 4 July 1945, 37 training missions flown 14 July–21 July 1945 (including missions of transporting new aircraft from Biak Island, New Guinea), four fighter sweeps over Formosa on 6 July–9 July 1945, and a dive bombing mission against the port of Karenko, Formosa, on 8 August.\\n\\nWhen the 201st deployed, no provision for replacement pilots had been made and the pilot losses incurred in the Philippines hampered its effectiveness. Mexican replacement pilots were rushed through familiarization training in the United States, and two more pilots died in flight accidents in Florida. When the 58th Fighter Group left the Philippines for Okinawa on July 10, the Mexicans stayed behind. They flew their last combat mission as a full squadron on August 26, escorting a convoy north of the Philippines. The 201st returned to Mexico City in November 1945.\\n\\nThe 201st Fighter Squadron was commended by General Douglas MacArthur, but the FAEM was disbanded after returning from the Philippines. Escuadrón 201 is still an active duty squadron, flying the Pilatus PC-7 from Cozumel, Quintana Roo, and saw extensive counter-insurgency service during the 1994 uprising in Chiapas.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nPilots marked with an asterisk (*) were killed during flying operations in the Philippines.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eshaunte Jones", "body": "Eshaunte \"Bear\" Jones (born 1989 in California), is a college basketball player, who decommitted from the Oregon State Beavers. In June 2007, he announced his intention to pass on an oral commitment to Indiana University. In October 2007, he announced his decision to attend Oregon State University the following season after playing as a 5th year senior at Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia. He would late de-commit from Oregon State after a coaching change. In June 2008, Jones signed financial-agreement paperwork with the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Because it was after the NCAA signing period, Coach Doc Sadler could not confirm at that time that he had accepted a scholarship. Once he cleared the NCAA clearinghouse process, he enrolled at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for the 2008 fall term.\\n\\nJones attended North Side High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he was ranked as one of the top players in the state from the class of 2007. As a sophomore, he led the North Side Redskins to the Class 4A Sectional 6 title with a victory over Snider High School. The following year, nearly the entire team returned as Jones led them to their first Summit Athletic Conference Title in seven years, culminated with a win over Bishop Luers High School in By Hey Arena. After the season, he was named an Indiana Junior All-Star.\\n\\nAs a senior, Jones orally committed to play for coach Kelvin Sampson at Indiana University  and then later in the day went on to score 37 points in his team's season opening scrimmage that night. He broke the school record for point in a single game twice in the first four games with 41 against Muncie Southside and 43 against Paul Harding High School in an overtime win. In December, he, alongside current (as of September 2010) Indiana University wide receiver Damarlo Belcher and current University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff forward Dominic Moore, led the Redskins to their first SAC Holiday Tournament Title since 1985 after losing in the finals the previous year. When the season ended, he averaged just under 28 points per game, finishing third in the state behind now former Indiana Hoosier and current Los Angeles Clipper Eric Gordon and high profile college recruit Deshaun Thomas, now of Ohio State.\\n\\nJones was named an Indiana Senior All-Star (the fifth in school history) before eventually de-committing from Indiana  and choosing to spent a year of prep school at Hargrave Military Academy.\\n\\nJones attended Hargrave Military Academy (Va.) for one season following high school. He played only a partial season because of a foot injury, but quickly made a name for himself. Jones averaged about 16 points and five rebounds per contest over the first 12 games of the 2007-08 season. His efforts helped Hargrave to a 12-0 start before the team continued on to an undefeated season with a 29-0 record, including winning the National Prep Invitational title. During the season, he signed a NLI with Oregon State.\\n\\nIn 2008, it was uncertain if Jones would end up at Oregon State  as they signed a new coach for the 2008-2009 season and sources said that he had asked out of his national letter of intent upon request. He was later granted the release from Oregon State and within a short time agreed to sign with Nebraska.\\n\\nJones sat out his true freshman season in 2008-2009 as a medical redshirt. He scored 16 points in 16 minutes in a preseason exhibition before the decision to sit out the season to fix a previous foot injury from his one season at prep school. Before the redshirt, he played just 46 minutes over the first four games of the season, including only four painful minutes against Saint Louis in his final game of the year. He scored seven points and hit just 2-of-7 from the floor, including 2-of-5 shots from 3-point range, over those four contests. Jones added five rebounds but had just one assist to four turnovers before deciding to sit out the remainder of the season.\\n\\nJones returned from a redshirt season when he had his left foot and a sports hernia surgically repaired and played in 29 games, averaging 16.9 minutes per contest in his first extended college action. Jones averaged 6.0 points and 1.6 rebounds per game while adding 1.0 assist per contest.\\n\\nOn the season, Jones hit 42.7 percent from the field, but it was his accuracy from beyond the arc that made opposing coaches take notice. Jones drained 43.5 percent from 3-point range while helping Nebraska set the school record by hitting 39.7 percent from long range as a team. Jones' proficiency shooting outside the arc helped him rank sixth on the Huskers' single-season 3-point percentage chart. His average was also the second-highest ever by a Husker freshman. On the year, he hit 40 3-pointers to rank second on the team while his total was the fifth-highest mark in the Nebraska freshman record book. \\n\\nJones' top performance came in the championship of the Las Vegas Classic when he scored 21 points, one of six double-figure scoring games on the season. He hit 6-of-11 shots from the field, including 5-of-7 from 3-point range, while adding three rebounds, two assists and a steal in 27 minutes off the bench. His 21 points made him one of just 23 freshmen in Nebraska history to record at least 20 points in a contest. In opening game of the tournament, Jones had 12 points on 4-of-5 shooting, all from 3-point range, in a victory over Tulsa, helping Jones earn all-tournament team honors.\\n\\nOn the year, Jones cracked the starting lineup twice, against UMKC and Kansas. Jones hit four three-pointers against the Jayhawks. Other games of note for Jones include a November 18 loss to Saint Louis where he had 9 points against former high school teammate Justin Jordan, who played for the Billikens, and also a December 12 game where he scored 4 points against Oregon State, a previous school of commitment. Jones missed the January 16 game against Iowa State, two days after the death of high school teammate Jeron Lewis, a basketball player at University of Southern Indiana, who collapsed on the court and later died on January 14. His next game, against Missouri, he was scoreless in just 8 minutes of play.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Esk Valley Line", "body": "The Esk Valley Line is the railway line from Middlesbrough to Whitby in North Yorkshire, England. The route follows the course of the River Esk for much of its eastern half.\\n\\nIt was designated as a community rail line in July 2005, being one of seven intended pilots for the Department for Transport's Community Rail Development Strategy. Part of the line may be upgraded as part of the Tees Valley Metro project.\\n\\nThe line is operated by Northern Rail using Class 142 and Class 156 DMU. Previously Class 144 DMUs were used frequently. It is one of the most rural railway lines in the United Kingdom and its sole main line link is via Middlesbrough. It also has a connection with the preserved North Yorkshire Moors Railway at Grosmont.\\n\\nThe route serves the following towns and villages.\\n\\nthumbthumb\\n\\nThe Esk Valley Line was once part of a large network covering the area, much of which was destroyed by Dr Beeching's cuts. Today's route is formed from four separate railway lines:\\n\\nThe first to be built was the line from Whitby to Pickering, by George Stephenson, and opened from Whitby to Grosmont in 1835, reaching Pickering a year later. It was originally worked by horses, and was converted to take steam locomotives in 1845, having been taken over by the York and North Midland Railway Company. In 1854 it became part of the NER. The section between Grosmont and Pickering was closed under the Beeching cuts in 1965, but was one of the first to be taken into private hands as a heritage line, worked by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. At Grosmont, the network line runs west following the river Esk up the valley towards Battersby. \\n\\nFrom Whitby Town a single track branched up a steep incline to Prospect Hill Junction from which trains could reach Whitby West Cliff station and journey north along the coast to Saltburn and on to Middlesbrough along the WRMU (Whitby Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway), or south across the towering red brick Larpool Viaduct towards Scarborough. The WRMU line was closed in the 1960s, however the northern section of the line was retained and is still in operation with passenger services between Middlesbrough and Saltburn. From Saltburn to Boulby, the line is also still operational as a goods route for potash and rock salt from Boulby mine.\\n\\nThe second railway line ran east from Picton (where it met the Northallerton-Eaglescliffe Line) and was built by the North Yorkshire and Cleveland, absorbed into the NER in 1858. The section between Grosmont and Castleton was the last to be opened, on 2 October 1865. The line was built in stages, opening to mineral traffic as far as Battersby on 6 April 1858 and to passenger traffic from Stokesley to Castleton on 1 April 1861. The section between Battersby and Picton closed to passengers in 1954. From Battersby, goods trains also ran south to Ingleby where a cable pulley system raised wagons up a steep incline and across the moors to iron ore workings at Rosedale and Farndale.\\n\\nBetween Glaisdale and Lealholm, work was begun by the railway engineer John Waddell on a branch across the moors to make the most of the iron ore in these parts. Originally intended to meet the Guisborough line, which branched off the WRMU near Boulby, a collapse in the price of the ore meant the line was never finished. At various points along the route you can see the remains of vast earthworks forming unfinished embankments and cuttings. The line was to have one station at Stonegate and nearby a tunnel dug using the \"cut and cover\" method. The only bridge completed on the line is at Rake Farm, between  and  at the route's junction with the Esk Valley line. The line is still known today as \"Paddy Waddell's Railway\" due to the number of Irish navvies used in its construction.\\n\\nToday Battersby has only one railway line, but it still takes the shape of a \"Y\" junction, with trains pulling into a station that is now effectively a terminus - the old line towards Picton continues on through the station and disappears round a bend before it ends. The driver has to change ends to drive towards either Whitby or Middlesbrough.\\n\\nThis is the youngest section of the route, constructed in 1864 to connect the Picton - Grosmont line to the Middlesbrough - Guisborough line. It leaves Battersby heading east with the Grosmont route, before making a sharp turn north to reach the Guisborough line at Nunthorpe Junction.\\n\\nthumbthumbThis section of line was constructed by the Middlesbrough &amp; Guisborough Railway (MGR) in 1854 to serve the town of Guisborough and the area around the Eston Hills. A line was constructed south from Middlesbrough heading through Nunthorpe from where it curved east via Guisborough and on towards the coast to join the Whitby Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway (see below). It also served a number of quarries in the area. Despite its close proximity to the Picton - Battersby line, it was another 10 years before a link was built between the two (see above). The line from Nunthorpe Junction to Guisborough closed in 1964, leaving the section from Middlesbrough open to Battersby.\\n\\nThe Esk Valley line still uses a physical token system, modified so that train drivers operate the token instruments themselves (the system of working is known as No Signalman Token Remote and is used on other routes such as the Heart of Wales Line and the Tarka Line). Cabinets at Whitby, Glaisdale and Battersby and a signalman at Nunthorpe pass on key tokens to train drivers as authority to occupy specific line sections, ensuring that only one train can run on a section at a time. Until the mid 1980s, the line from Whitby to Sleights had two tracks, but these were removed along with the passing loop at Castleton. Trains can still pass at Glaisdale and Battersby, although Glaisdale is now the only station along the single track section that still regularly uses both platforms for \"up\" and \"down\" line trains. Between Nunthorpe and Guisborough Junction, the railway has been single track since 26 January 1986, although Nunthorpe retains its loop with separate \"up\" and \"down\" platforms. This section is worked from the panel box at Middlesbrough and uses track circuit block working.\\n\\nThe North Yorkshire Moors Railway has been running steam trains between Whitby and Glaisdale in the past few years, using hired locomotives and stock insured for use on Network Rail track. It is planning a share scheme to raise capital for operating services direct from Whitby Station (again on the existing Network Rail infastructure). This would involve work on signalling facilities, improvements to rolling stock and ticket facilities at Whitby. To allow through running of trains directly from the North Yorkshire Moors line, an intermediate token instrument was provided at Grosmont in March 2007. This allows a token for the Glaisdale-Whitby section to be obtained or returned at Grosmont. Previously, for steam services to Whitby to operate from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway a signalman had to drive to Glaisdale to pick up or return a token key.\\n\\n|}\\n\\n"}

Eskatrol contained dextroamphetamine sulfate and prochlorperazine.\\n\\nIn August 1970 the F.D.A. sought to limit the use of stimulants by calling for changes in labeling which decreased the number of allowable claims and intensified the warnings about possible hazards.

Sir James Melville described him as \"of nature, upright, just, and gentle\".\\n\\nAt the age of 37 he was introduced to the 13-year-old James VI of Scotland at the time when the latter made his formal entry into Edinburgh. Stewart went on to the Privy Council. He was created 1st Earl of Lennox, on 5 March 1580, and finally 1st Duke of Lennox on 5 August 1581. In Presbyterian Scotland the thought of a Catholic duke irked many and Lennox had to make a choice between his Catholic faith or his loyalty to James. At the end Lennox chose James and the king taught him the doctrines of Calvinism. The Scottish Kirk remained suspicious of Lennox after his public conversion and took alarm when he had James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton tried and beheaded on charges of treason.\\n\\nIn response, the Scottish nobles plotted to oust Lennox. They did so by luring James to Ruthven Castle as a guest but then kept him as prisoner for ten months. The Lord Enterprisers forced him to banish Lennox. A lengthy denunciation of Lennox was issued from Stirling Castle on 17 September 1582, citing his religion, association with the murderers of Lord Darnley and Regent Moray and Regent Lennox, and his control over the royal household and international intrigue. In December travelling from Berwick on Tweed, on his way south, by accident the Duke encountered the French ambassador, M. de la Mothe Fénélon, near Northallerton, who was travelling north to treat with the Gowrie Regime. In London the Scottish poet William Fowler pumped him for infomation which he sent to Francis Walsingham. The duke journeyed back to France and kept a secret correspondence with James. With his return to France, Lennox had met a frosty reception as an apostate. The Scottish nobles had believed that they would be proven right in their convictions that Lennox's conversion was artificial when he returned to France. Instead the former duke remained Presbyterian and died shortly after. After his death in May 1583 William Schaw took his heart back to James in Scotland. James had repeatedly vouched for Lennox's religious sincerity and memorialized him in a poem called \"Ane Tragedie of the Phoenix\", which said he was like an exotic bird of unique beauty killed by envy.\\n\\nEsmé Stewart married Catherine de Balsac, circa 1572.

{"title": "Esophagogastroduodenoscopy", "body": "In medicine (gastroenterology), esophagogastroduodenoscopy is a diagnostic endoscopic procedure that visualizes the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract up to the duodenum. It is considered a minimally invasive procedure since it does not require an incision into one of the major body cavities and does not require any significant recovery after the procedure (unless sedation or anesthesia has been used). A sore throat is also common.\\n\\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy may be abbreviated EGD, or OGD if one uses the British spelling oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. It is also called upper GI endoscopy (UGIE), gastroscopy or simply endoscopy (since it is the most commonly performed type of endoscopy, the ambiguous term 'endoscopy' refers to EGD by default).\\n\\nThe patient is kept NPO (Nil per os) or NBM (Nothing By Mouth) that is, told not to eat, for at least 4–6 hours before the procedure. Most patients tolerate the procedure with only topical anesthesia of the oropharynx using lidocaine spray. However, some patients may need sedation and the very anxious/agitated patient may even need a general anesthetic. Informed consent is obtained before the procedure. The main risks are bleeding and perforation. The risk is increased when a biopsy or other intervention is performed.\\n\\nThe patient lies on his/her left side with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the endoscope. The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine the first and second parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the endoscope. Still photograph can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.\\n\\nIn its most basic use, the endoscope is used to inspect the internal anatomy of the digestive tract. Often inspection alone is sufficient, but biopsy is a very valuable adjunct to endoscopy. Small biopsies can be made with a pincer (biopsy forceps) which is passed through the scope and allows sampling of 1 to 3 mm pieces of tissue under direct vision. The intestinal mucosa heals quickly from such biopsies.\\n\\nBiopsy allows the pathologist to render an opinion on later histologic examination of the biopsy tissue with light microscopy and/or immunohistochemistry. Biopsied material can also be tested on urease to identify Helicobacter pylori.\\n\\nThe complication rate is about 1 in 1000. They include:\\n\\nProblems of gastrointestinal function are usually not well diagnosed by endoscopy since motion or secretion of the gastrointestinal tract are not easily inspected by EGD. Nonetheless, findings such as excess fluid or poor motion of gut during endoscopy can be suggestive of disorders of function.

It is currently used mostly for football matches, as it is the home of Villarreal CF. \\n\\nThe stadium with 25,000 seats was originally built in 1923. Due to the small size of the Villarreal town (just over 50,000 inhabitants) it is popularly said that the town is deserted when Villarreal plays, as almost half of it fits in the stadium; the average attendance reaches 17,000 fans.\\n\\nThe stadium was inaugurated on June 17 of 1923 with the match between CD Castellón and Cervantes, and named Campo del Villarreal, but it was renamed to its current denomination only 2 years later, in honour to the rural lands on which it was erected. Nicknamed the Feudo Amarillo (\"Yellow Feud\"), it is located at Plaza Labrador, 5 kilometres away from the Mediterranean Sea, and at an altitude of 50 metres.\\n\\nThe first remodelling works took place on the summer break of 1952. The size of the pitch was taken from 95 x 65 m to 105 x 65 m, matching that of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium of the 1952 Summer Olympics, a reference to copy during those years.\\n\\nDuring the 1960s the club erected a small covered stand, and during the 1971/72 season the southern stands were finished. In 1988 it was demolished to make room for a new stand opened on March 8, 1989 with a friendly match against Atlético Madrid.\\n\\nFor the club's 75th anniversary the club started new renovation works. The south stand was again demolished to erect a new one with a roof, an amphitheatre, the VIP sector, and the northern stand were built, finishing the works at the 1999/00 season.\\n\\nthumbThe stadium was first floodlit for night matches on September 16, 1973 for the third division match between Villarreal CF and SE Eivissa-Ibiza. The city hall provided help for the construction of the floodlight towers located at each of the four corners of the field, with nine halogen lamps on top of each one.\\n\\nThe locker rooms were moved several times. Until the 1935/36 season they were at the south eastern corner of the stadium, then at the north east until the 1989, when they were moved to the south western part. After the last modifications to the stadium, the dressing rooms are now under the main stand.\\n\\nEl Madrigal provides all sorts of comforts for its fans that search for added-value services to watch their favourite football team. For them, there are 30 Casals Grocs VIP boxes with air conditioning, TV with direct transmission of the matches (for those who can't see a match without replays), catering service, individual seats and independent access from the southern stand with 3 elevators to quickly reach the box parking. Of the 30 boxes, five accommodate 20, twenty-three accommodate 16, and the last two 12 fans. There is also a statue of a yellow submarine outside the stadium to represent the club's famous nickname.\\n\\nTo be approved for the UEFA Champions League, stadiums have to fulfil a series of requisites, for which the Stadium had to be quickly renovated in 2005 to meet those regulations. The façade was covered with yellow tiles, both to improve aesthetics, and to benefit the local industry of tiles. The dressing rooms were also renovated, creating an office for the coach, physiotherapy room, and a bath and showers area. There were also created an office for the UEFA delegates, an anti-doping hall, and the room for press conferences was expanded.\\n\\nThe separation of the pitch from the public has been expanded one meter, and the entrance to the dressing rooms had to be revised.

It is set in Italian seaside resort Riccione in July 1943, around the time of the dismissal of Benito Mussolini during the Allied invasion of Sicily in World War II. Estate violenta is Zurlini's second feature film, with which he made his name as film director.\\n\\nCarlo Caremoli (Trintignant) arrives in Riccione and enjoys life together with his friends at his father's villa. Riccione is still peaceful, and only few things remind about the war fought in the south. On seaside holiday, the youth witness a German fighter flying low over the beach and causing panic among the crowd. Carlo tries to protect a frightened little girl who runs towards him and meets her mother Roberta, a navy officer's widow (Rossi Drago). He helps her to take the girl home. Carlo is attracted to Roberta, often meets her and even has a trip with her to San Marino, although Roberta's mother (Lilla Brignone) disapproves this new acquaintance and urges her to stay away from Carlo, partly because of his father, Ettore Caremoli (Enrico Maria Salerno), who has been a brutal Fascist. Meanwhile, Maddalena (Federica Ranchi), a young sister of Roberta's deceased husband, arrives from Catanzaro, fleeing the impending war. Maddalena spends time with Carlo's friends, and Roberta together with her is invited to a circus.

The camera cuts between Carlo and Roberta, glaring at each other passionately. Carlo asks Roberta's hand for the next dance, and the couple ends up kissing in the garden, which deeply hurts Rosanna. The next day Roberta initially refuses to admit her feelings to him, but ultimately accedes. Meanwhile, on July 25 the news of Mussolini's ouster was announced. Carlo and Roberta continue to go out on dates. However, Carlo's father is forced to flee, and his villa is confiscated. Carlo meets Roberta once again and spends a night with her, provoking discontent of her mother. Maddalena decides to leave.

In 1998, he moved back to Argentina where he played for three years with Independiente and one with River Plate. During this time, he earned his nickname \"Egg in a bun.\" With some good experience under his belt, he returned to Real Madrid in 2002. He helped ''Los Blancos'' win the UEFA Super Cup in 2002, La Liga, the Intercontinental Cup in 2002, and the Spanish SuperCup in 2003.\\n\\nIn July 2004, Cambiasso signed with Internazionale after his contract with Real Madrid expired in June 2004. He helped Internazionale win the Italian Cup in his first season with the club, playing regularly as a defensive midfielder, partnered in the middle of Inter's midfield with fellow Argentinian Juan Sebastián Verón. In Italy, he became known as one of the outstanding players of the 2004–05 season, along with AC Milan's Kaká.\\n\\nDuring the return match for the final of the 2006 Coppa Italia, Cambiasso scored an impressive goal, the first of the match, for the 3–1 victory over Roma. On 30 September 2006, he scored twice in the opening game of the season, with Inter defeating Fiorentina 3–2. On 7 November 2007, he along with Zlatan Ibrahimović scored a brace a piece to defeat CSKA Moscow 4–2 in the UEFA Champions League. On 23 March 2009, it was announced that Inter and Cambiasso had come to terms about a contract renewal which now expires in 2014.\\n\\nHe was very important in the 2010 Champions League win as well, scoring the second goal of a 2-1 victory over Chelsea in the San Siro, a result which ultimately saw Inter go on to win the tournament.\\n\\nCambiasso first represented Argentina in the youth squads, along with national teammates Juan Román Riquelme, Pablo Aimar, Wálter Samuel and others.

In the quarter-finals match against Germany on 30 June 2006, the match went into penalties, where Cambiasso had his penalty kick saved, resulting in Argentina losing 4–2 and Germany progressing to the semi-final.\\n\\nSince Maradona took over as Argentina coach, Cambiasso was only called-up once to the national team for a friendly game on 14 November 2009 against Spain, despite continuing to play a vital role for Inter and affirming his status as one of Europe's best central midfielders.

{"title": "Estela Ruiz", "body": "Estela Ruiz (born April 8, 1936) is an alleged Marian visionary in Phoenix, Arizona.\\n\\nRuiz grew up in Lordsburg, New Mexico, the daughter of Mañuel and Delfina Aguilera. Her father was a sometimes-unemployed alcoholic, and her mother's business supported the household. Her father verbally and emotionally abused her mother, who in turn vented her frustration on Ruiz, on whom she relied for support. When Ruiz was sixteen, her mother made a promesa to the Virgin of Guadalupe that if her eldest son Inocensio, Ruiz's older brother, survived his illness, she would scale Mount Cristo Rey in pilgrimage. Inocensio recovered and Aguilera took Ruiz along on this climb, where Ruiz felt a \"mysterious force\" lifting her up the mountain despite her fatigue. Though the family was Catholic before, following Inocensio's recovery the household devotion to the Church and to the Virgin of Guadalupe grew even stronger. While in her thirties, her mother developed and recovered from endometrial cancer, which she interpreted as her \"cross to bear\". The anthropologist Kristy Nabhan-Warren views Delfina Aguilera's \"physical and marital suffering\" as an enactment \"in her own relationship with Jesus and the Virgin of Guadalupe.\" The relationship between suffering and religion had a profound impact on Ruiz's understanding of life. A car accident twenty-five years later that led to her father's recovery from alcoholism allowed him to have a better relationship with her mother and to be a grandfather to Ruiz's children.\\n\\nRuiz married Reyes Ruiz, a man who had been a devotee of the Virgin of Guadalupe since the age of seven. The two had six children, four of whom graduated from institutes of higher education. One of their sons, Armando Ruiz, became a representative in the Arizona House of Representatives and later in the Arizona State Senate. After her children had all grown, Ruiz decided to return to school and focus on her career. She earned a Bachelor's degree in education from Ottawa University in Phoenix, and enrolled in a Master's of Education program at Northern Arizona University. In the early 1970s, she was hired to work for the Murphy School District in Phoenix and worked her way up the bureaucratic ladder to become superintendent of the district's bilingual programs.\\n\\nWhen her mother later began suffering as a result of the radiation therapy, Ruiz drove daily from her Phoenix workplace to the hospital in Lordsburg. She developed the same symptoms as her mother, whose death made Ruiz feel that she was going to die also. While she didn't die, she did realized how dependent she had been on her mother. She became determined to succeed in her career and started attending assertiveness-training courses offered at the hospital. The courses helped her to increase her self esteem, set goals, separate herself from her mother, and feel like she was in control of her life. According to Ruiz, this sense of control was illusory: \"I didn't realize that it was God who was in control, I actually thought I was the one in control, can you believe it?!\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, her husband Reyes, who had long been involved in many Catholic activities, including the encuentro movement of Spanish-speaking Catholics in the United States, the Catholic farmworkers rights campaigns, and prison ministries, forged ties with Father Jack Spaulding of St. Maria Goretti Church in Scottsdale and his group of nine young Marian visionaries. In 1988, he accompanied Father Spaulding to Medugorje, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Virgin Mary appeared to six youths beginning in 1981. While in Medugorje, Reyes prayed that his wife would help lead the family down a more spiritual path. \\n\\nDespite her religious upbringing, Ruiz describes herself at the time as a skeptic and a \"Sunday morning Catholic\". A successful, sophisticated woman, Ruiz was embarrassed by Reyes' religiosity and was jealous of his affection for the dark-skinned Virgin. While her husband was gone, Ruiz almost took down the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe (painted by Reyes) that hung in their home. She decided to leave it up, however, and the next day as she walked past the painting, she heard it wish her a good morning. She dismissed the greeting as a figment of her imagination or a signal of mental instability. The next week, the painting greeted her again, and Ruiz felt a sensation that the voice was coming from the Virgin Mary. Following the two auditory experiences, Ruiz began waking up early with a strong desire to attend six o'clock mass. By the time Reyes returned, he found his wife much more open to his spirituality, and when he asked for her help to spiritually revitalize the family, she agreed.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Ruiz had two dream of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Ruiz later interpreted these dreams as preparation for her first vision.\\n\\nOn the night of December 3, 1988, Ruiz, Reyes, their son Fernando, and Fernando's wife Leticia, who was pregnant with their fourth child, were all praying the Rosary. Ruiz in particular was praying for her son Reyes Jr., who was struggling with cocaine addiction and for Fernando and Leticia's marriage. During the final decade, Ruiz says she saw a light emanating from a portrait of the Immaculate Heart of Mary that grew brighter until it forced her to close her eyes. At that moment, the Virgin spoke to her: \"Don't you know that I am going to take care of your children?\" Ruiz was overcome with emotion and began to cry, calling out, \"Qué linda! Qué linda!\" (\"She's beautiful! She's beautiful!\").\\n\\nFor the next ten years, Ruiz claimed that the Virgin appeared to at least weekly, and often daily. She identified herself as Our Lady of the Americas and relayed messages to the Ruiz family, the people of the barrio, and to greater community of \"the Americas\" via Ruiz, sometimes speaking in English and sometimes in Spanish. The majority of the messages focus on the necessity of prayer, especially of the rosary, and on the need to evangelize and \"fight Satan\" in order to make the world a better place. Some have interpreted the demand to improve the world as necessary prepare the world for the second coming of Jesus Christ. She also demanded a shrine, which the family built in their back yard during the next year. The shrine includes of a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a painting of Our Lady of the Americas by Reyes, and a life-sized wooden crucifix, also by Reyes.\\n\\nRuiz wanted to drop out of school and immediately dedicate herself to the Virgin's work. Instead, she claims the Virgin counseled her to finish her program. She and her family spent the rest of the year \"working on themselves\", spiritually preparing themselves to go public with the messages. When they did, the Phoenix diocese investigated their claims and ultimately neither sanctioned nor disavowed them.\\n\\nThe Ruiz family began their evangelism through the creation of Mary's Ministries, a lay Catholic organization that runs leadership faith camps, and proselytizes. Mary's Ministries has branches in Linares Chile; Sullana, and Lima, Peru; Cuenca, Ecuador; Hirador, Southern Colombia, Franca, Brazil; Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico and in the Mexican states of Coahuila and Durango.thumbThe desire for spiritual improvement led to a will to better the lives of people \"in the world\", which spawned several organizations. The ESPIRITU Community Development Corporation (ECDC), an outgrowth of Mary's Ministries, is a community development association designed to alleviate the suffering that results from the poverty of the barrio. The ECDC helps finance the development of low-income housing and lobbies for commercial development in the South Phoenix area, but its main function is to develop international, principle-based, servant leaders, which is in part accomplished by running the NFL Youth Education Town (NFL-YET), one of Arizona's first and largest charter school, and its satellite campus in Safford. In Africa, Mary's Ministries has a missionary (Mary house) in Uganda, in East Africa, with 5 missionaries carrying forward Mary's Ministries' mission. \\n\\nThe NFL-YET, formerly called Esperanza Montessori Academy, was enlarged to serve over 600 students after receiving a million-dollar grant from the NFL in 1996.\\n\\nThe Ruizes' backyard shrine was an established pilgrimage site from 1989—1998. Ruiz appeared on the Geraldo Rivera Show and on the Sally Jessy Raphaël Show in the early 1990s and since then has traveled extensively to share her experiences. As a result the shrine became one of the most frequented sites of the 1990s. The family also celebrates the anniversary of the first apparition, a celebration that has changed over time. While clergy have always been involved with the family and the phenomenon, the Church has become more involved over time as the shrine and Mary's Ministries have become more institutional. A procession was instituted in 1990, during which processioners carry holy images, statues, and crosses, sing hymns, and sprinkle holy water in the crime-ridden streets of South Phoenix. The hearing of confessions began in the early 1990s, and Mass and the Eucharist began in 1998. Attendance at the yearly celebration grew, peaking at about one thousand for the reading of the final message in 1998. Afterwards, the shrine was converted into an enclosed chapel, and the yard surrounding it was fenced in. Instead of being open to the community at all times, where it was one of the few neutral zones for South Phoenix's gangs, the chapel is now only open at certain hours. And since the final message, the yearly celebration has become more of a retreat for Mary's Ministries members, although the Matachina dancers who attended the first celebration and performed for the Virgin of Guadalupe still attend.\\n\\nIn August 1998 Ruiz related that the Virgin of the Americas would soon stop issuing her public messages. Ruiz claimed to have received the final public message in December of the same year, but continues to receive personal and family messages. At the final, emotional reading, Ruiz read a message that focused on the Virgin's power of healing.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ethnic Conflict in the Former Soviet Union", "body": "There are many different ethnic groups present in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union today. This diversity has been the source or instigator of conflict for centuries, and remains a major part of Russian political life today. While the Russian Empire, the USSR, and the Russian Federation were each made up of a majority of ethnic Russians, the minority groups have always been present to fight for their own languages, cultures, and religions. There are many different types of ethnic conflict, and the vast majority can only be understood with the help of a historical context.\\n\\nThe ethnicities that emerged in the region of the Russian Empire and the former Soviet Union are historically based on language and culture rather than physical traits . The majority of Russia’s people trace their origins to the Eastern Slavs, a group which would eventually evolve into the ethnic Russians, the Ukrainians, and the Belarussians . This group emerged in the Steppe region of Eastern Europe, or the Eastern European Plain to the west of the Ural Mountains. The Caucasus region, meanwhile, lies in the Caucasus Mountains between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It includes groups such as the Armenians, Georgians, Azeris, and many other groups from both indigenous and Turkic origins . Because of the mountainous terrain in the region, many different ethnically diverse groups of people emerged. This phenomenon was further assisted by centuries of invasion by groups from both Europe and Asia, and later settlement by many of these invaders. For this reason, groups from the Caucasus region have maintained an isolationist and inward-looking position on international affairs . Similarly, many ethnic tribes settled in the northern part of the territory to create the Finnic, Volga, and Baltic nations. To the east, central Asian groups such as the Kazakhs, the Uzbeks, the Turkmen, the Tajiks, the Kyrgyz, and the Karakalpaks emerged.\\n\\nThroughout the Kievan Rus’ Period, from the late ninth century to the mid thirteenth century, warfare consistently broke out between the Eastern Slavs and their neighbors to the south and east living as nomads in the Steppe regions . Conflict between these groups varied as their interests aligned or diverged.\\n\\nIn the thirteenth century, the Tatar-Mongol army, led by Genghis Khan and later Batu Khan, invaded the Caucasus region and the Russian Plain during what is now termed the Golden Horde . After conquering the North Caucasus, these armies overran the Russian Plain between 1231 and 1236, finally moving to invade central Europe in 1241. This invasion created the vast Mongol Empire which would serve to absorb and unify many of the ethnic groups living in the region. Not only were the Armenians, the Georgians, the Bulgars, the Tatars, and the Finnic peoples joined together under one rule, but they also experienced the settlement of many of the large, migrating Turkic and Mongol tribal groups. By the end of the thirteenth century, the Tatar-Mongol Golden Horde ruled much of Siberia and all of European Russia except for small territories in the north-west, and in western Ukraine . As the migrations and invasions of the era came to an end, a great number of distinct ethnic and linguistic groups gradually formed in a complicated patchwork throughout European Russia.\\n\\nAs Tatar rule weakened throughout the fifteenth century, the small principality of Muscovy gradually gained power and expanded its own rule in the region. It increasingly became known as Russia in reference its dominant ethnic group, Rus. Muscovy was home to many distinct ethnic and religious groups, although many people still identified with local towns and principalities, not with the Muscovite Empire or even with a general ethnic group: religion, language, geographical area, and blood ties remained the determining factors of allegiance . Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, the growth of nationalistic ideals, the spread of education, and the growing influence of European culture not only increased loyalty to the Russian state, but also to individual ethnic groups. In addition, Muscovite power was solidified throughout the region as the Eastern Slavs expanded and colonized the territories of non-Russian people.\\n\\nThe ethnic conflicts which dominated this time were mainly due to colonization, subjugation, and forced assimilation by the Muscovite (later Russian) Empire. As Muscovite power was consolidated throughout the 16th century, new laws were put in place by leaders such as Ivan the Terrible which would reorganize local government and further subordinated the numerous non-Russian ethnic groups. The Partitions of Poland, which took place in the second half of the eighteenth century, brought large groups of Ukrainians and Belarussians under czarist control, as well as a Jewish population of over one million . Wars with the Turks, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia also ended with Russian annexation of large territories throughout Eastern Europe. Many of the ethnic groups newly brought under Russian control were pressured and forced to assimilate: local languages, cultures, and religions were prohibited, a policy which was enforced with brutality. This process of Russification carried on throughout the reign of the Russian Empire as Russian ministers introduced ever more extreme policies aimed at assimilating the majority of the non-Slavic national groups into the Russian culture and language .\\n\\nHowever, the liberal ideals of nation and nationalism began to take root for many of these ethnic groups starting in the seventeenth century. Even groups which had already begun to assimilate responded to the European ideals of nationalism and self-determination. These groups were able to coalesce to form an estimated 150 distinct ethnic and linguistic groups by 1870 . The largest of these groups were the Belarussians; the Ukrainians; the Finnic Peoples, including the Karels and the Ingrians; the Baltic peoples including the Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians; the Caucasian peoples, including the Armenians, Georgians, Azeris, Chechens, Ingush, and Kalmyks; the Crimean Tatars; the people of the Volga Basin, including the Tatars, the Bashkorts, the Chavash, the Volga Finnic Peoples, the Maris, and the Mordvins; the Permian peoples, including the Komis, the Permyaks, and the Udmurts; the Moldovans; the Central Asians, including the Kazakhs, the Uzbeks, the Turkmen, the Tajiks, the Kyrgyz, and the Karakalpaks; the people of Siberia and Far East; and the non-territorial ethnic groups, such as Jews, Germans, and the Rom, or Gypsies. As many of these groups embraced the principles of nationalism, the czarist government retaliated by suppressing nationalist leaders, creating even greater resentment among the non-Russian peoples. This caused events such as the rebellion of Belarussian serfs against the Empire in 1863, an attempt which was brutally suppressed by czarist armies . This event in particular had lasting and severe effects on the Belarussian people, who experienced virtual stagnation of all economic activity.\\n\\nIncreasingly radicalized dissidence, widespread poverty, and the increasing number of revolutions throughout the Empire culminated in the Russian Revolution of 1905. As the twentieth century began, the Russian government employed reactionary policies in direct opposition to the increasingly militant revolutionaries and nationalist ethnic minorities. National leaders of minority groups had one of two goals in mind for the 1905 Revolution: while some were looking for autonomy and a complete break from the Russian Empire, others hoped for a more democratic Russian government which would recognize cultural and linguistic minorities. Unfortunately the reforms that were put in place as a result of this revolution were quickly discarded as the Russian government reverted to its reactionary policies. In addition, the outbreak of World War I subdued much of the national and ethnic unrest throughout the empire. By late 1915, however, the revolutionary dreams of many ethnic groups returned in the face of universal conscription and worsening conditions. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 brought about the opportunity for these minority ethnic groups to seize control of their own nations. The chaos that followed the revolution, however, left provinces all throughout Russia without any form of government, a void which leaders of ethnic groups attempted to fill. By 1918, the Ukrainians, Armenians, Azeris, Estonians, Latvians, Georgians, Lithuanians, North Caucasians, Moldovans, and many other national groups declared their autonomy in hopes of gaining recognition by the Allied Forces.\\n\\nAfter civil war consolidated the power of the Bolshevik party, the new Soviet Union reconquered much of the lost territory, causing many nations to lose their autonomy. The policies of Vladimir Lenin, however, designated autonomous republics, provinces, regions, and districts for groups of non-Russian ethnicity. One of the most prominent attempts at resistance to Soviet control was in the Turkestan region of Central Asia by a Muslim guerrilla group called the Basmachi. The Basmachi Rebellion continued from 1918 to 1924, when the Soviet armies finally crushed the revolt with a mixture of military force, concessionary policies, and elimination of the majority of the region’s tribal and nationalist leaders . The leadership of Joseph Stalin reintroduced many of the assimilation policies of the imperial period, urging loyalty to the Soviet Union only. He opposed national autonomy to the extent that he replaced the leaders of each republic with ethnic Russian members of the Communist party and regularly removed leaders of ethnic nations from power. This policy continued through to the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev, who replaced the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan with an ethnic Russian . This initiated the first major instance of ethnic violence, in which riots broke out among demonstrators and ten thousand Soviet troops were deployed to quell the revolt. Other conflicts followed in the late 1980’s, including the Armenian–Azerbaijani conflict over the Nagorno-Karabagh region, the Uzbek-Meskhetian Turk conflict over Uzbekistan’s Fergana Valley, and bids by numerous ethnic groups for Soviet republic status.\\n\\nAs the Soviet Union began to collapse, social disintegration and political instability fueled a surge in ethnic conflict . Social and economic disparities, along with ethnic differences, created an upsurge in nationalism within groups and discrimination between groups. In particular, disputes over territorial boundaries have been the source of conflict between states experiencing political transition and upheaval. Territorial conflicts can involve several different issues: the reunification of ethnic groups which have been separated, restoration of territorial rights to those who experienced forced deportation, and restoration of boundaries arbitrarily changed during the Soviet era. Territorial disputes remain significant points of controversy as minority groups consistently oppose election outcomes and seek autonomy and self determination. In addition to territorial disputes and other structural causes of conflict, legacies from the Soviet and pre-Soviet eras, along with the suddenness of the actual sociopolitical change, have resulted in conflict throughout the region . As each group experiences dramatic economic reform and political democratization, there has been a surge in nationalism and interethnic conflict. Overall, the fifteen independent states that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union face problems stemming from uncertain identities, contested boundaries, apprehensive minorities, and an overbearing Russian hegemony .\\n\\nThere are several stages of ethnic conflict, all of which have been present in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union. These include claims presented in the form of declarations, introduction to and support of these claims by the masses, conflict not resulting in casualties, conflicts involving casualties, and interethnic wars. Of the total number of recorded ethnic conflicts, 40% remain in one of the first two stages, while 15% have reached the third or fourth stage. Conflicts such as the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Georgia-Ossetia, Georgia-Abkhazia, Ossetia-Ingush, and Moldova-Pridnestrovje conflicts have escalated to final stage, involving warfare. A predominance of these instances of ethnic conflict is located in the Caucasus and the Central Asian regions as a result of territorial disputes and political unrest. In addition, conflict between Russia and other former Soviet states has accounted for a large amount of present conflicts. Hostilities between Russia and groups of the North Caucasus area, such as the Chechens, are rooted deeply in historical differences, resulting in the first and second Chechen Wars . Overall, the enormous diversity of the area of the former Soviet Union, along with greater feelings of nationalism and ethnic identity, have led to an increase in ethnic tension and discrimination that remain a large part of social and political relations both among and within each state.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Etichonids", "body": "The Etichonids were an important noble family, probably of Frankish , Burgundian or Visigothic origin, who rose to dominate the region of Alsace in the Early Middle Ages from the seventh to the tenth centuries. \\n\\nThe earliest accounts record the family's beginnings in the pagus Attoariensis around Dijon in northern Burgundy. In the mid-seventh century a duke of the region named Amalgar and his wife Aquilina are noticed as major founders and patrons of monasteries. With donations given by the King Dagobert I and his father to recover their loyalty and in compensation for the losses that as supporters of Queen Brunhilde and her grandson Sigebert II they had,and from whom probably their ascendency in Burgundy stemmed originally,they founded a convent at Brégille and an abbey for men at Bèze, installing children in both abbacies. They were succeeded by their third child, Adalrich, who was the father of Adalrich, Duke of Alsace. This second Adalrich was the true founder of the family's greatness in Alsace, where he secured the ducal title. His cognomen, Eticho, became the name of the family. \\n\\nUnder the Etichonids, Alsace was generally divided into a Nordgau and a Sundgau. These counties, as well as the monasteries of the duchy, were brought under tighter control of the dukes with the rise of the Etichonids. There exists scholarly debate concerning whether or not the Etichonids were in conflict or alliance with the Carolingians, but it is possible that they were both: opponents of the extension of Charles Martel's authority in the 720s when he first made war on Alemannia, but allies when the Alemanni, under Duke Theudebald invaded Alsace (which had a large Alemannic element in its population) in the early 740s. The last Etichonid duke, Liutfrid, may have died fighting Theudebald on behalf of Pepin the Short. \\n\\nAmong the descendants of the Etichonids, in the female line were Hugh of Tours and his family, including his daughter Ermengard, who was wife to Lothair I and thus mother to three Carolingian kings. In the tenth century the Etichonids remained powerful in Alsace as counts, but their power was circumscribed significantly by the Ottonians and by the eleventh century, Pope Leo IX seems unaware that his ancestors, the lords (or counts) of Dabo and Eguisheim for the previous half century were in fact the direct descendants of the last Etichonids. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Euell Gibbons", "body": "Euell Theophilus Gibbons (September 14, 1911 – December 29, 1975) was an outdoorsman and proponent of natural diets during the 1960s.\\n\\nHe was born in Clarksville, Texas on September 14, 1911, and spent much of his youth in the hilly terrain of New Mexico during the dust bowl era. His mother taught him about foods available in the wild. As an adult he spent time in several states working a variety of jobs. During a stay in Hawaii from 1947 to 1951, he met and married Freda Fryer. Throughout his travels his interest in wild foods continued and he experimented with new recipes and consulted experts.\\n\\nAlthough Gibbons longed to be a writer, he had difficulty getting published. However, capitalizing on the growing return-to-nature movement in 1962, his first book, Stalking the Wild Asparagus, became an instant success. From the cover blurb:\\n\\nGibbons then produced the cookbooks Stalking the Blue-Eyed Scallop in 1964 and Stalking the Healthful Herbs in 1966. He was widely published in various magazine, including two pieces which appeared in National Geographic Magazine. The first article, in the July 1972 issue, described a two-week stay on an uninhabited island off the coast of Maine where Gibbons along with his wife Freda and a few family friends relied solely on the island's resources for sustenance. The second article, which appeared in the August 1973 issue, features Gibbons, along with granddaughter Colleen and grandson Mike, stalking wild foods in four western states.\\n\\nGibbons's publishing success brought him fame. He made guest appearances on The Tonight Show and The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Susquehanna University, even though he had only completed the equivalent of a sixth-grade education.\\n\\nA 1974 television commercial for Post Grape-Nuts cereal featured Gibbons asking viewers \"Ever eat a pine tree? Many parts are edible.\" While he recommended eating Grape Nuts over eating pine trees (Grape Nuts' taste \"reminds me of wild hickory nuts\"), the quote caught the public's imagination and fueled his celebrity status. Johnny Carson joked about sending Gibbons a \"lumber-gram\", and Gibbons himself joined in the humor; when presented with a wooden award plaque by Sonny and Cher, he good-naturedly took a bite out of it. (The \"plaque\" was actually an edible prop.)\\n\\nOften mistaken for a survivalist, Gibbons was simply an advocate of nutritious but neglected plants. He typically prepared these not in the wild, but in the kitchen with abundant use of spices, butter and garnishes. Several of his books talk of his self-described \"wild parties\": dinner parties where guests were served dishes prepared from plants gathered in the wild. His favorite recommendations included lamb's quarters, rose hip, young dandelion shoots, stinging nettle and cattails. He often pointed out that gardeners threw away the more tasty and nutrient-rich crop when they pulled such weeds as purslane and amaranth out from among their spinach plants.\\n\\nEuell died on December 29, 1975 at Sunbury Community Hospital in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. His death was the result of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, a complication from Marfan syndrome.\\n\\nHe was posthumously satirized by cartoonist Scott Shaw as \"You-All Gibbon - The Junk Food Monkey\" in the independently published comic book \"Quack!\"..

{"title": "Eugene Buechel", "body": "Eugene Buechel (Eugen Büchel), * October 20, 1874 in Schleida, now Schleid, in Thuringia, Germany, † October 27, 1954 in O'Neill, Nebraska, was a Roman Catholic priest and missionary, linguist and anthropologist among the Brulé or Sicangu Lakota or Sioux on the Rosebud Indian Reservation and the related Oglala Lakota or Sioux on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.\\n\\nHe was the tenth and last child of his parents. His father was a farmer whose father and grandfather had been village mayors; several of his relatives had emigrated to America. When Eugen was born, four of his parents’ earlier children had died. In 1881 Eugen's father and in 1882 his mother died. After grade-school (1881–86), he attended the boarding-school for boys of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda (1886–96) followed by three semesters in the Fulda diocesan seminary (1896–97).\\n\\nOn October 12, 1897, he entered the noviciate of the German Province of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), which then was located in Bleijenbeek (Netherlands) due to the expulsion of the Jesuits during the Kulturkampf of the German Reich. After completing this two-years-probation period and further humanistic studies at Exaeten (Netherlands) he was sent to the United States to continue his studies in July, 1900.\\n\\nFrom August 1900 to May 1902 Eugen Büchel studied philosophy at the Jesuits' Sacred Heart College in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. In May 1902 his superiors sent him to St. Francis Indian Mission in the Rosebud Indian Reservation of the Sicangu or Brulé Lakota in South Dakota. This mission and the Holy Rosary Mission among the Oglala Lakota in the neighboring Pine Ridge Reservation had been founded in 1886 and 1888, resp., by Jesuits of the German Province with collaboration from the German Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity. From 1902 to 1904 Büchel worked as an educator at the boarding-school and a teacher of religion and music while also studying the Lakota language. In September 1904 he began to study theology at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri, and on June 28, 1906, he was ordained a priest. After another year of formation (tertianship) in Brooklyn, Ohio, Father Büchel returned to the Lakota in August 1907, first as a teacher at Holy Rosary Mission School in Pine Ridge, and then in 1908 as its superior for eight years.\\n\\nOn December 10, 1909, Father Superior Büchel buried Oglala-Chief Red Cloud in the cemetery of Holy Rosary. Over thirty years earlier, Red Cloud had demanded \"Black Robes\" and \"Holy Women,\" i.e. Catholic priests and nuns, for the Oglala from the U.S. authorities. On September 25, 1914, Büchel became an American citizen and changed the spelling of his name to Eugene Buechel.\\n\\nIn October 1916 Buechel moved to St. Francis to become superior there for six years. From 1926 to 1929 he was sent returned to Holy Rosary as a missionary, and in 1929, Buechel transferred back to St. Francis again, where he stayed until his death. After suffering a stroke he died at St. Anthony’s Hospital, O'Neill, Nebraska, on October 27, 1954. He lies buried at St. Francis.\\n\\nDuring most of his career, Buechel served as an itinerant missionary who lived among the Lakota and frequently stayed in the homes of Lakota parishioners. At various times he also served as the superintendent of the St. Francis Mission school, Rosebud Reservation, and the Holy Rosary Mission school (now Red Cloud High School and Red Cloud Grade School), Pine Ridge Reservation. On both reservations Wanbli Sapa (Black Eagle), as he was called, collaborated closely with native catechists, among them Nicholas Black Elk (of Black Elk Speaks).\\n\\nBuechel was dedicated to converting the Lakota to Christianity and transforming their lives. But also he was dedicated to preserving their Lakota language and cultural heritage. Already during his first stay at St. Francis (1902–1904) Buechel wrote down stories of the Lakota. In collaboration with Ivan Stars and other Lakota catechists, Buechel collected oral histories, now published bilingually, and cultural objects with related information, now preserved at the Buechel Memorial Lakota Museum, St. Francis, South Dakota, and first displayed at the Mission in 1921. With the Sicangu Lakota , he also collected names of plants and their use and he took photographs of the people on the reservations to document their lives. Between 1902 and 1954, he compiled over 24,000 Lakota (and Dakota) word entries on slips of paper for a bilingual dictionary of the Lakota language, which included approximately 18,000 from the work of Stephen Return Riggs, several thousand from his conversations with native people, and a few from the works of Emil Perrig, S.J., and Lakota anthropologist Ella Cara Deloria.\\n\\nIn 1924, Buechel published his first notable work in Lakota, his Bible History, which included a selection of texts modeled after the German Biblische Geschichte. In 1927 the Jesuit missionaries, with Buechel playing a major role, published Sursum Corda, a Lakota-language book of prayers and hymns, and in 1939, Buechel published his main work, A Grammar of Lakota. Meanwhile, he gained recognition as a linguist through his correspondence with anthropologists like Franz Boas and Lakota Ella Cara Deloria. Buechel was not able to finish his dictionary himself; it appeared in print long after his death, as did other books building upon his collections.\\n\\nIn 1947, on the occasion of Buechel's 50th anniversary as a member of the Jesuit order, Joseph Schwart (born Josef Schwärzler in Austria) a Jesuit religious brother, constructed a separate museum building for the ethnological collection. When Buechel died, it contained 661 objects, each with a name and description (most often in Lakota) written by him, and a catalogue number. During the following decades it grew to about 2,200 at present.\\n\\nBuechel's linguistic work today is recognized and used as one of the most important sources for the Lakota language by all who want to learn it or have a general concern in its preservation and development. Many Lakota remember him as a man who respected their personal dignity and their traditional culture. Among the Jesuits today, he is increasingly perceived as a role model because of his respectful attitude towards the Lakota as a people and as individuals.\\n\\n"}

She was Dominica's first, and to date only, female prime minister, as well as the nation's longest serving prime minister. She was the second female prime minister in the Caribbean after Lucinda da Costa of the Netherlands Antilles, and the first woman elected in her own right as head of government in the Americas. She was the world's third longest-serving female Prime Minister, behind Indira Gandhi of India and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, and the world's longest continuously serving female Prime Minister ever.\\n\\nCharles was born in the fishing village of Pointe Michel in Saint Luke parish, to a \"coloured bourgeoise\" family. She attended the Convent School, the island's only girls' secondary school, and became interested in law while working at the colonial magistrate's court. She worked for many years as assistant to Alastair Forbes. She attended university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada before moving to the United Kingdom to attend the London School of Economics. She was a member of the sorority Sigma Gamma Rho. She passed the bar and returned to Dominica, where she became the island's first female lawyer, establishing a practice specialising in property law.\\n\\nCharles never married nor had children, which caused friction for her in the male-dominated sphere of Caribbean politics. In 1991 she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\\n\\nthumbCharles began campaigning in politics during the 1960s against restrictions on press freedom. She helped to found the Dominica Freedom Party, and was its leader from the early 1970s until 1995. She was elected to the House of Assembly in 1970 and became Opposition Leader in 1975. She continued serving after Dominica gained full independence from British rule in 1978.\\n\\nCharles became Prime Minister when the DFP swept the 1980 elections, the party's first electoral victory. She took over from Oliver Seraphin, who had himself only taken over the year before after mass protests had forced the country's first prime minister, Patrick John, to step down from office. She additionally served as Dominica's Foreign Minister from 1980 to 1990, and also served as chairperson of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).\\n\\nIn 1981 she faced two attempted coups d'état. That year Frederick Newton, commander of the Military of Dominica, organised an attack on the police headquarters in Roseau, resulting in the death of a police officer. Newton and five other soldiers were found guilty in the attack and sentenced to death in 1983. The five accomplices sentences' were later commuted to life in prison, and Newton was executed in 1986. Also in 1981, a group of Canadian and American mercenaries, mostly affiliated with white supremacist and Ku Klux Klan groups, planned a coup to restore former Prime Minister Patrick John to power. The attempt, which the conspirators codenamed Operation Red Dog, was thwarted by American federal agents in New Orleans, Louisiana, and was soon facetiously dubbed the \"Bayou of Pigs\" after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.\\n\\nCharles became more widely known to the outside world for her role in the lead-up to the United States Invasion of Grenada. In the wake of the arrest and execution of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, Charles, then serving as chair of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, appealed to the United States, Jamaica, and Barbados for intervention. She later appeared on television with US president Ronald Reagan, supporting the invasion.\\n\\nCharles and her party were considered conservative by Caribbean standards. However, many of her policies appeared centrist or even leftist by American standards; for instance she did support some social welfare programmes. Other issues that were important to her were anti-corruption measures and individual freedom. For her uncompromising stance on this and other issues, she became known as the \"Iron Lady of the Caribbean\" (after the original \"Iron Lady\", Margaret Thatcher).\\n\\nHer popularity declined during her third term, and she announced her retirement in 1995. The DFP subsequently lost the 1995 elections. After retiring, she undertook speaking engagements in the United States and elsewhere, and became involved in former US President Jimmy Carter's Carter Center, which promotes human rights and observes elections. On 30 August 2005, Charles was taken to a hospital in Fort-de-France, Martinique, for hip replacement surgery and died from a pulmonary embolism on 6 September, aged 86.\\n\\n"}

He is regarded as a saint, with a feast day of September 13.\\n\\nHe was a successful combatant of the heretical errors then current in Egypt, notably the various phases of Monophysitism. He was a warm friend of Pope St. Gregory the Great, who corresponded with him, and received from that pope many flattering expressions of esteem and admiration. Among other merits the pope makes special mention of his defence of the primacy of the Roman See.\\n\\nSt. Eulogius refuted the Novatians, some communities of which ancient sect still existed in his diocese, and vindicated the hypostatic union of the two natures in Christ, against both Nestorius and Eutyches. Cardinal Baronius says that Gregory wished Eulogius to survive him, recognizing in him the voice of truth.\\n\\nIt has been rightly said that he restored for a brief period to the Church of Alexandria that life and youthful vigour characteristic of those churches only which remain closely united to Rome.\\n\\nBesides the above works and a commentary against various sects of Monophysites (Severians, Theodosians, Cainites and Acephali) he left eleven discourses in defence of Pope Leo I and the Council of Chalcedon, also a work against the Agnoetae, submitted by him before publication to Pope Gregory I, who after some observations authorized it unchanged. With exception of one sermon and a few fragments, all the writings of St. Eulogius have perished.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eumeswil", "body": "Eumeswil is a philosophical postmodern novel by the Goethe Prize winning German author Ernst Jünger. Written in 1977 in the author's mature years, Eumeswil is set in an undatable post-apocalyptic world, somewhere in present-day Morocco. This aphoristic novel follows the inner and outer life of Manuel Venator, an historian in the city-state of Eumeswil who also holds a part-time job in the night bar of Eumeswil´s ruling tyrant, the Condor.Eumeswil may be considered as the ultimate compendium of mature Jüngerian wisdom, distilled from a long life of intense and diverse experiences, reflections, readings, travels and encounters with extraordinary personalities. (Jünger lived from 1895 until 1997 and experienced the 20th century more deeply and diversely than perhaps any other European or American author.) The key theme in this novel is the figure of the anarch, the inwardly-free individual who lives quietly and dispassionately within but not of society and the world. As Jünger says in the book, the anarch is the positive counterpart of the anarchist. The concept of the anarch is developed explicitly and implicitly throughout the novel through the reflections and actions of Manuel Venator. Venator and the anarch may be considered as autobiographical reflections of the author himself - indeed, anarch-hood can be studied equally well through the life that Ernst Jünger himself lead.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Europa postage stamp", "body": "Europa stamps have been issued annually since 1956. First sets representing the founding 6 members of the ECSC, European Coal and Steel Community, then by the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) in 1959, (first stamps issued in 1960) and by PostEurop since 1993. Initially in 1956 a total of 13 stamps were issued with a common design from 6 different countries. A common theme of Peace and Welfare through agriculture and industry was used for 1957. The common design reappeared in 1958 and continued until 1973. From 1974 the designs reflect a common theme. The common design idea replaced the common theme in 1984, which was the CEPT 25th Anniversary (1959-84) and shows a symbolic bridge, said to represent Liaison, Exchange and Communication. With the split of posts and telecoms providers in most countries, CEPT is no longer responsible, but the postal authorities under the guidance of PostEurop continue the Europa tradition. From 1993 all the stamps have \"Europa\" inserted into the design in small print. For the new millennium in 2000, the common design once more replaced the common theme. The stamp design for 2000 clearly shows a column of 6 stars representing the original 6 members of the ECSC. 4 Children,(of different heritage) represent Europe's future and are adding to the Vertical Star Column with the background depicting the GREEN letter E meaning a fertile Europe.

Each ride requires the purchase of a ticket (prices vary between one and ten euro per trip, depending on the ride itself). \\n\\nIn addition, the park features a restaurant and a pub. Near the center of the park grounds is an enclosed \"Playground\" including plastic tunnels through which small children could crawl while their parents watch through a screen. \\n\\nLunapark Milano opened its gates for the first time in 1965 for a limited (45 day) season. In response to its growing success, its season expanded to two months in 1966 and three months in 1967. Lights were erected in the park in 1968, allowing the park to stay open into September. \\n\\nIn 1970, Lunapark Milano adopted its current schedule (open seven days a week March through September) and every weekend throughout the year as it declared itself to be a \"permanent park.\" In the ensuing years, attendance grew rapidly as rides and other attractions were added to the grounds. The increasing cost of the new attractions caused a rift between the owners of the park and the concessionaires, culminating in a change of management (afterwards called \"Luna Park Management\") in 1977. The relationship between management and concessions became free of contention as the vendors agreed to pay higher rent as management continued to add attractions through 1980.\\n\\nBy 2002, the finances of the park became precarious to the point of the management giving the concessionaires an ultimatum: anybody not renewing his lease would be evicted immediately and the attraction dismantled. The evictions were then deferred for one year; Lunapark Milano closed in 2003, seemingly permanently. New owners took over management of the park and renamed it Luna Europark Idroscalo Milano in 2004. \\n\\nSince then, an upgrading that the park had not seen for two decades resulted in a restoration of the crowds that were lost since the early 1970s. Technology – both in rides and in communications – was added to the park's offerings as it started to exhibit motion simulator and an adult-oriented house of horrors. Live entertainment made its appearance in Europark Idroscalo Milano, as did larger and flashier rides, including the 30 meters (100 feet) tall \"Super Frisbee.\"\\n\\n"}

It currently receives the support of 7 universities (Lund, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Groningen, Roma, Rostock, Warsaw) and four research organisms (INED, NIDI, MPIDR, VID).\\n\\nThe EDSD is open to students of all nationalities with a master's degree and enrolled in the first year of a European PhD programme. Students will acquire a solid knowledge base on causes and consequences of demographic change, population data, statistical and mathematical demography, as well as modeling, simulation and forecasting. Teaching is provided by leading international experts in the fields of study covered. Since the School places great importance on both teaching demographic methods and preparing the student for a career in demography, each course will expose the students to a number of guest lecturers discussing their topics of expertise. By the end of the year, EDSD participants will have developed an extensive network of contacts with established researchers from throughout Europe.\\n\\nThe EDSD admits a new cohort of about 20 students every year. The EDSD does not charge fees, and makes available a number of scholarships to enable students to attend the School's course program. The language of the school is English.\\n\\nThe EDSD is an eleven-month program (from September to July). For school years 2007-8 and 2008–09, the School has been located and operated at INED in Paris (France). For school years 2009-2010 and 2010–2011, the School will be hosted at the Center for Economic Demography at Lund University (Sweden). The preparatory courses (from September to mid-October) will be offered at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock (Germany).\\n\\nTheories of demographic behavior and change (CAUSES): The aim of the course is to introduce students to macro-level theories of population change, micro-level theories of demographic behaviour and the micro-macro interactions. At the end of the course, students should comprehend the major theories that explain the level and timing of fertility, family formation and dissolution, the ageing of individuals and society, migration behaviour and migration systems. These theories are situated within the overarching framework of the human life course, embedded in institutional contexts that reflect economic, social, cultural and historical conditions. In addition, students should understand the demographic transition and the demographic response to situational changes such as technological change, economic development, food shortage and economic crisis. Students should be able to apply these theories to interpret data on levels and differentials in demographic change and the drivers: fertility, mortality and migration. \\n\\nStatistical demography (STATISTICS): The course deals with statistical models and approaches where time events and states are the central concepts of the analysis. Students are expected to learn the concepts underlying these methods as well as how to use the methods to analyze empirical data. The course consists of two modules, event history analysis and panel data models. \\n\\nPopulation data and summary measures (DATA): This course covers the sources of demographic data, methods for assessing the quality of data, methods for working with incomplete or inaccurate data, basic summary measures including life-table statistics, Lexis diagrams, rates of the first and second kind, period vs. cohort statistics, tempo distortions, and related topics.

{"title": "European river lamprey", "body": "''River Lamprey redirects here. See Lamprey River for the river in New Hampshire''\\n\\nThe European river lamprey, also known as the river lamprey or lampern, is a jawless lamprey, scientific name Lampetra fluviatilis. It is found in coastal waters around almost all of Europe from the north-west Mediterranean Sea up to the lakes of Finland, Scotland, Norway (Lake Mjosa), Wales (Cors Caron) and Russia, including rivers in the Alps. It feeds as ectoparasite and parasite of fish. It has a reproduction cycle similar to that of salmon. River lampreys belong to the same genus as brook lamprey and are thought to be very closely related. Current thinking suggests that European brook and river lampreys are a paired species, which means the river lamprey represents the anadromous (sea going) form of the resident brook lamprey. However, this is an area that is still being actively researched.\\n\\nRiver lampreys migrate upstream from the sea to spawning grounds in autumn/winter. Spawning activity is greatest in the springtime (like brook lamprey) and river lamprey ammocoetes also spend several years in soft sediment before migrating to sea as adults. It is not currently known how long these animals spend in marine habitats before making the return trip to spawn.\\n\\nAs ammocoetes, because of their close similarity to brook lamprey, it is very difficult to identify these animals beyond genus level (Lampetra). They average 30 cm in length as adults but some may be considerably smaller (20 cm) but in each case they are distinctly larger than adult brook lamprey (12–14 cm). They are generally 150 g in mass, and their maximum life span is roughly 10 years.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "European super grid", "body": "In 2001 Dr Eddie O’Connor, the founder and CEO of Airtricity, was wrestling with the problem of taking wind energy from the periphery to a central position in meeting future electricity demand. His intuitive knowledge of weather systems from previous work was reinforced by a research article from the University of Kassel in Germany. His reasoning was that if we could build a grid system large enough to capture wind energy over say 5000km and connect up to large hydro reserves in Scandinavia and central Europe then a firm source of electricity generation, rivalling nuclear in its invariability, would be created using wind energy. This concept Eddie called the Supergrid. A key to making this new grid work was the existence of High Voltage DC (Direct Current) transmission technology which had been in existence for 50 years.\\n\\nThe concept was launched at a conference which Airtricity co hosted with the European Wind Energy Association, in Brussels in December 2001. \\n\\nOver the intervening years the concept was turned into an executable meshed electricity transmission system, in DC, having thought out the central idea of a ”Supernode”. \\n\\nThe Supergrid is defined as: “an electricity transmission system, mainly based on direct current, designed to facilitate large-scale sustainable power generation in remote areas for transmission to centres of consumption, one of whose fundamental attributes will be the enhancement of the European market in electricity. It mirrors existing AC grids in its reliability and standards of customer service. It is connected to large batteries such as Norwegian dammed hydro and pumped storage in the Alps. It incorporates sufficient information technology to provide instantaneous price and quantity information to allow customers to buy the cheapest power across the EU ”.\\n\\nAs time marched on and as oil became scarce, and the EU mandated that large coal plant was to be wound down, the UK and Germany, along with Denmark began to bring forward plans for large quantities of offshore wind. The Supergrid began to appear to a large number of companies and member states as the only way to bring the generated electricity to the customer. 10 countries in Northern Europe signed a Memo of Understanding on the 10 Dec 2010 whose main thrust was “to declare that they share the common goal of moving to a sustainable low carbon economy.......to recognise that the renewable energy sources in the North Sea have the potential to contribute to this goal........will require large scale development of appropriate offshore grid infrastructure.........and will tackle barriers to grid development at national, regional and EU level, in particular regulatory, legal, market, planning, authorisation, and technical issues.”\\n\\nIn 2010 Eddie O’Connor, since 2008 the Founder and CEO of Mainstream Renewable Power brought together a group of companies to address the practical issues of bringing a Supergrid into existence. This group entitled “The Friends of the Supergrid” would address the issues that would be central to the creation, operation and regulation of the Supergrid.\\n\\nThe issues relate to:\\n\\nThe members of the “Friends” are Mainstream Renewable Power, Siemens, 3E, Alstom, DEME Blue Energy, Elia, Visser & Smit Marine Contracting, Hochtief, Prysmian, Parsons Brinckerhoff, CG Global, Nexans, WPD, ACS and Nexans. \\n\\nThe intention and purpose of the European Supergrid is:\\n\\nA similar concept is the DESERTEC concept which is linked to the idea of using concentrating solar power (CSP) stations in the deserts with power brought to Europe by HVDC lines. However Dr Czisch has examined various detailed options for generating power and has found that the optimum grid at the moment is based around wind energy, although this may change as prices for CSP change.\\n\\nAll his scenarios have included 30% of European power coming from Norwegian and other hydro plants.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eustace Folville", "body": "right\\n\\nEustace Folville (died 1346) was the leader of a robber band active in Leicestershire and Derbyshire in the first half of the 14th century. With four of his younger brothers, he was responsible for two of the most notorious crimes of early 14th century England: no mean achievement, considering the same period saw Richard of Pudlicott ransack the royal treasury, and Adam the Leper seize the port of Bristol.\\n\\nEustace's family had its seat at Ashby Folville, Leicestershire. They were landholders of some prominence. The family name, ultimately derived from Folleville in the French region of Picardy, is attached to several other sites in Leicestershire, such as the deserted village of Newbolt Folville. They seem to have gained most their estate at the beginning of the 12th century. Several of their possessions, such as Ashby and the manor at Teigh, were in the hands of other parties at the time of the Domesday survey, but had passed to the Folvilles by the reign of Stephen (1135-1154). The family were certainly well-established in Leicestershire by the mid 13th century. In 1240 a member of the family donated a large sum to the church at Cranoe.\\n\\nThe father of Eustace was most likely Sir John Folville, by all accounts a respectable member of the gentry. Under Edward I, John represented Leicestershire at six Parliaments, and in 1301 he was summoned 'to attend the royal standard, with horse and arms well fitted, at Berwick-upon-Tweed, on the nativity of John the Baptist, in the prosecution of the Scottish wars'. He may also have held the office, ironically enough, of Deliverer of Warwick Gaol in 1277 and 1287. With his wife Alice he produced seven sons. The oldest, also named John, inherited his father's estates in 1310, and passed them in turn to his second son, Jeffrey. John is the only one of the seven Folville brothers who was not implicated in large-scale theft, kidnapping, extortion and murder.\\n\\nEustace, named for his grandfather, was the second oldest of the Folville brothers. His criminal career apparently began in 1326 when, on 19 January, he led an ambush against Sir Roger Bellere, in which the victim was cruelly murdered. Bellere was attacked in a 'small valley' near Rearsby, Leicestershire, apparently with a retinue of fifty men. With Eustace were his brothers Roger and Walter, and fellow local landowners Roger la Zouche and Robert Halewell. While la Zouche may have inflicted the death-blow, the blame was squarely laid with Eustace: the chronicler Henry Knighton, a native of Leicestershire himself, refers to him as Eustachius de Fuluyle qui Robertum Bellere interfecerat ('Eustace de Folville who assassinated Roger Bellere'). Even by contemporary standards the crime was one of extreme audacity, made all the more shocking by the standing of the victim. Bellere was not only a local nobleman of some repute, the possessor of some nine manors and the founder of the chantry chapel at Kirby, he was also a baron of the exchequer, and at one stage its chief treasurer. The so-called Folville Cross, a  high fragment of an ancient crucifix, is supposed to mark the site of the murder.\\n\\nThe Folvilles were immediately summoned to stand trial for Bellere's death. However, like many other medieval felons, they could not be traced by the authorities: they may have fled to Wales or France. They were declared outlaw in their absence. This new status seems to have suited them, as within a few years petitions were issued to the Sheriff of Nottingham, 'complaining that two of the Folville brothers were roaming abroad again at the head of a band, waylaying persons whom they spoiled and held to ransom'. In the period of 1327-1330, Eustace was either directly accused of, or mentioned in connection with, three robberies, four murders, and a rape. This last charge, it should be noted, may not necessarily imply sexual violation. The medieval term raptus is notoriously slippery, and contained a range of meanings, from bodily violence to abduction. The Folvilles also seem to have allied themselves with the infamous Cotterel gang. The Cotterels certainly gave the Folvilles shelter in their territory, the Peak District, Derbyshire. They were at one stage pursued here by officers of the crown, but managed to evade capture after a local informer warned them of the danger.\\n\\nVarious indictments from the period portray Eustace and his brothers as freelance mercenaries, hired 'by the ostensibly law-abiding...to commit acts of violence on their behalf'. Members of Sempringham Priory and Haverholm Abbey, both in Lincolnshire, seem to have made use of their services, and at one stage they were under the patronage of Sir Robert Tuchet, a major lord of Derbyshire and Cheshire. In 1332 the Folvilles launched what may be seen as a sequel to the murder of Roger Bellere, and attacked another agent of the crown, the justice Sir Richard Willoughby. This time the victim was ransomed for the sum of 1300 marks, close to £900. Willoughby was easily able to raise this substantial amount, and was freed within twenty-four hours.\\n\\nA year after the kidnap of Willoughby, Eustace was serving in the armies of Edward III against the Scottish. He may well have fought at the Halidon Hill. Perhaps most surprisingly, in recognition of this military service, Eustace received a full pardon for his crimes. He was in combat again in 1337 and 1338, at Scotland and Flanders respectively. He finally died in 1346, a member of the council of the abbot of Crowland, having stood trial for none of the charges lodged against him. He is buried at St Mary's church, Ashby Folville. His monument has been badly damaged: a Victorian description states that 'the fragments of his helmet form the only part of his funeral achievement now remaining'.\\n\\nthumbFor a modern reader, it may seem strange that Eustace Folville faced such little resistance in his lifetime, and suffered no form of legal penalty. After all, he was well-known as an habitual offender for two full decades. During this time he went wholly unpunished, unlike his unfortunate brother Richard. But two factors may explain Folville's apparent good fortune. Firstly, the political turbulence of the 1320s worked in his favour, particularly in the case of his worst crime, the murder of Bellere. While this was undeniably an outrage, and at least partly an affront to royal authority, Bellere had been closely connected to the Despensers: he was appointed attorney to Hugh Despenser the Younger in 1322, and used the revenues of confiscated lands to curry favour with the family. Owing to the Despensers' proximity to Edward II, after the downfall of that King, official opinion had little sympathy for an ally of the family. In fact Eustace was pardoned for the murder as early as 1327, the same year that Edward was deposed, and again in 1329. Neither pardon seems to have tempted him back to a more honest life, but they did bring an end to the first wave of prosecution against him.\\n\\nSecondly, and most importantly, there does seem to be a widespread perception that Eustace and others like him were basically honest and forthright, at least more so than the authorities that pursued them. This would mean that the justices and their clerks, reliant as they were on testimonies from local people, would find their job extremely difficult in the Folville's home territory. As E.L.G. Stones notes, complaints along these lines are frequently made by the trailbaston and other commissions: 'in all these things they are aided and abetted by local people, who incite them to their evil deeds and shield them after they are done'. While these laments might seem to excuse the commissions' own failures, there is undoubtedly some truth to them. After all, a tip-off from a local source allowed the Folvilles and Cotterels to elude capture in the Peak District.\\n\\nThis popular support seems to be rooted in a sense that the Folvilles were allies of the common people, combating the crooked establishment which oppressed them. There is at least some justification for this view. Eustace's two principal victims were certainly highly corrupt individuals. Bellere used his office to seize land and syphon money to his patrons, and his murder should be regarded less as a crime by the Folvilles alone, and more a conspiracy by several Leicestershire landowners. Eustace's accomplices were members of the Halewell and Zouche families, which suggests a breadth of ill-feeling against Sir Roger, going well beyond any one group. Willoughby was no more popular. In 1340 he was targeted by a second gang, who trapped him in Thurcaston castle. He was later imprisoned by Edward III on charges of corruption, indicted by several juries across the country, and forced to pay 1200 marks for the king's pardon. Eustace was respected as an opponent of such figures, even if this opposition was not his primary motive.\\n\\nFor the generations after Eustace's death, the positive view of the Folville gang only increased. In later sources they are not merely regarded as law-breakers, but agents of an unofficial law, outside human legislation and less susceptible to abuse. In the B-text of Piers Plowman (c.1377-9), William Langland, a Midlander himself, sees them as instruments of the divine order. While he is scathing about popular veneration of 'Robyn Hood and Ralph Erl of Chestre', he speaks approvingly of 'Folvyles lawes'. The crimes of the family are presented as correctives to the 'false' legal establishment. The 'Folvyles' are listed among the 'tresors' that Grace has given to reassert God's pattern against the 'Antecrist'. Langland states: \"Forthi,\" quod Grace, \"er I go, I wol gyve yow tresor/ And wepne to fighte with whan Antecrist yow assailleth...some to ryde and to recovere that unrightfully was wonne ('\"Therefore,\" said Grace, \"before I go, I will give you treasure and weaponry to fight with when Antichrist attacks you...some men to ride and to recover that which was unjustly taken'). Henry Knighton is no less sympathetic. He portrays Bellere and Willoughby as entirely legitimate targets: Willoughby's ransom is reduced to a less avaricious 90 marks, while Bellere becomes the aggressor of his killers, not only 'heaping threats and injustices' on to his neighbours but coveting their 'possessions'. Most interestingly, the kidnap of Willoughby is portrayed as a direct conflict between the two codes represented by the outlaws and the justice: Sir Richard is abducted as punishment for trespassing on the territory of a rival order, specifically 'because of the trailbaston commissions of 1331'.\\n\\nFor his contemporaries and near-contemporaries, Eustace Folville was clearly more than an acquisitive thug. He was something closer to an enforcer of 'God's law and the common custom, which was different from the state's or the lord's law, but nevertheless a social order'. Whether he in fact merited such a reputation is a matter of debate.\\n\\n"}

From c.1649 until his death he was also consistently important in the politics of his native Glamorgan, and of Gloucestershire. He was a committed and active Protestant and an antiquarian scholar to boot.\\n\\nSeys was born into a squirearchical family of Boverton Place in the Vale of Glamorgan. They claimed descent from Bleddyn Ap Maenarch, an eleventh-century lord of Brecon. In the nineteenth century, descendants of the family through a female line were still incorporating the alleged arms of Bleddyn, and perhaps do even now. But it was standard practice for \"new\" families in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to \"discover\" a noble ancestor amid the conveniently remote mists of the heroic age. Evan's properly documented forebears are far less romantic and far closer to home: his great-grandfather was Yevan Saisy of Cowbridge. Such a provenance implies that Yevan was a burgess rather than a gentleman who was likely to have been rurally based and, coupled with his surname, the descendant of a fairly recent English incomer: \"Sais\" is Welsh for \"Englishman\". Whatever his occupation, status, and antecedents, Yevan was well-off enough to have his son, Roger, educated (where and by whom?) and then legally trained. There may have been other sons equally fortunate given the proliferated Seys cousinhood of Evan's own seventeenth-century day. But back in the Tudor period, the family, recent gentry/nouveaux riches, were rising into the local elite by a shrewd blend of lawyering, marriage and land-buying: Roger's wife brought him the lands on which he built Boverton Place, his son Richard's, Evan's mother, property near Swansea. This blend Evan was to continue on a large scale to considerable effect, adding a prudently mutable infusion of politics to the mix.\\n\\nThus the filiation is:\\n\\nEvan attended Cowbridge School and is first heard from, aged 14, formally orating in Latin before an audience of its co-founder, Sir John Stradling, 1st Baronet, and his lady, of his own parents quite possibly, plus some distinctly lesser local worthies. This was probably a special occasion to celebrate the school's tenth anniversary rather than the annual speech day familiar in recent times. Nor was Seys likely to have been the head boy: even if the concept is not itself also anachronistic, there were presumably pupils markedly senior to him: he himself was to stay at school until the age of 17, when in 1621 he went up to Christ Church, Oxford. Rather, he may well have been chosen as orator because he was virtually the Stradlings' social equal — or at least on the way. Indeed, he was probably the pupil of highest social status. This had been bestowed of course by his own parents, also local potentates, therefore well worth the honour and flattery which the choice of their son accorded them, and which, if present, they could savour at first hand. And young Evan must have been a good scholar to boot. He was however just the upmarket mouthpiece: the actual author of the speech was the master, the Revd Walter Stradling, a poor relation of the founders.\\n\\nThus composed and delivered, its tone is, unsurprisingly, sycophantic, but the speech is the main source for the foundation and furbishment of Cowbridge School, and by extension useful evidence for Jacobean grammar schools on a broader plane. Strikingly, Sir John had presented his own, at £10, very expensive copy of the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of the Flemish geographer Ortelius: so Geography as well as Classics was on the curriculum.\\n\\nCome to man's estate (in both senses), Seys enjoyed a long and successful legal and political career, although the latter was not of the first rank: successful in part because he was \"flexible\" and sure-footed in that era of political tsunamis. He was Recorder of Gloucester in 1649 and a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1652. He went on to hold legal office in Wales under the Protectorate and was a member of the committee for governing Glamorgan, in which capacity he examined the charters of its boroughs in the 1650s, possibly with a view to remodelling them to favour his own Cromwellian party. This culminated in his becoming the Attorney General to Oliver Cromwell and serving as MP for Glamorgan during the evanescent rule of Richard Cromwell in 1659. At Oliver's quasi -royal funeral he was an official mourner. \\n\\nBut this devoted Cromwellian then had a change of heart – or head. The year 1659 also saw him as part of the broad (indeed \"rainbow\") coalition of \"moderates\" preparing the restoration of Charles II. From 1661 to 1681 (namely up to his very last years) he was MP for Gloucester, having smoothly crossed into the Restoration era via the bridge of his new-found Royalism and Loyalism.\\n\\nSeys prospered materially as well during these politically variegated decades: in 1656 he capitalized on his Gloucestershire connection by acquiring the Manor of Dymock off Sir John Winter, a staunch royalist who had suffered financially because of his convictions. In 1666–8 he bought a substantial slice of the Glamorgan lands worth £12,000 alienated by the Earl of Pembroke. The Gloucestrian connexion went back to 1638 at least when Evan had married Margaret, daughter of Robert Bridges of Woodchester, who brought him £2,500 (at least £1,000,000 in our money) earmarked to buy land. . Even a bizarre family rift of his youth turned out to his advantage: his eldest brother, Roger, was disinherited for striking his mother and proceeded to compound this and destroy any hopes of rehabilitation by embarking on a career of wildly oscillating religious extremism. Emerging from a Jesuit seminary as a priest in the 1620s, Roger was, by the 1640s, an \"itinerant Puritan minister of radical views\" (Philip Jenkins).\\n\\nEvan, by contrast, seems essentially to trim to the side of those wielding power, wealth, and authority at any given time: his own parents and Sir John Stradling in his youth – he became the formers' heir in place of the disgraced and extreme Roger –, the Rump Parliament in 1649–53, Lord Protector Cromwell in 1653–8, Richard Cromwell briefly in 1658–9, King Charles II immediately afterwards, and the Earl of Pembroke in 1666–8. His mouthpiece delivery in adolescence of a speech truckling to the local great and good (probably including his own parents) was a harbinger.\\n\\nHis career enjoyed the most worldly success of any seventeenth-century pupils at Cowbridge School, with the striking exception of his junior, Sir Leoline Jenkins (1623/5–1685). Jenkins's was all the more impressive as he was of much humbler origin: the more impressive also as he never wavered from his staunch Royalism and Anglicanism, although he suffered from this materially after the fall of Charles I in 1646. Much the same can be said of Evan's close kinsman, Richard Seys of Swansea, and a host of fellow Glamorganites of all ranks, while for the radical left, the mid-Walian Vavasor Powell supported the Rump and then the brief Republic of 1649, but was openly and bravely defiant towards the Protectorate and towards the restored monarchy; and this oddly assorted trio could well have endured far worse persecution (Sir John Winter of Gloucester likewise): Cromwellian rule, which got a grip on the country from 1653 after a prolonged stretch marked by intermittent chaos (1646–53), was particularly harsh in obdurately royalist shires like Glamorgan, and Seys was one of its leading agents there. He, conversely, seems to have enjoyed an unbroken run of success in the 1640s, 1650s, and 1660s alike: he could have mentored his younger contemporary the Vicar of Bray.\\n\\nIn the way of political cataclysms, the English Civil War/Interregnum gave opportunities for \"new men\" to rise: Phillip Jones, the leader of the Roundheads in Glamorgan, was, like many of his followers, from the extreme west of the county:largely hilly and infertile. A gentleman in name only in 1641, with a yeoman's income of £20 a year, he had become by 1658 Comptroller of Cromwell's household with the title of Phillip, Lord Jones. Like Seys, but even more remarkably, he not only survived the Restoration but flourished under it: was put on the Glamorgan Bench in 1672 – a sure sign of rehabilitation – and died worth c.£1,500 a year in 1673 with a large country house in the Vale at Fonmon.\\n\\nSeys, his supporter and follower, did not have so far to travel, being already of an affluent gentry family of the Vale, then the key portion of Glamorgan given its rich farmland; nor did he rise so high. Even so, he held positions under the Cromwells – Attorney General for the whole of England and Wales and MP – that his ancestors had never enjoyed under the old regime. His grandfather, Roger, had been Queen's Attorney for Wales under Elizabeth, his father, Richard, had enjoyed the grandiose title of Attorney-General of Glamorgan, an office he duly passed on to Evan in 1636; but these were sectional and, therefore, lesser versions of Attorney General. And like Jones, he consolidated this self-enhancement under the Restoration, remaining an MP for most of Charles II's reign, namely for most the rest of his own life. There was wealth as well as office: his purchase of the Pembroke lands (1666–8), which was probably facilitated on favourable terms because Seys was a member of the moderate party which looked to the Earl for leadership.\\n\\nPhilip Jenkins argues that this moderate party was significant in South Wales throughout the period of the 1640s–80s, although, given the extreme political volatility of that time, naturally mutating over the years. There were two other main factions. First the high/inveterate royalists, regionally headed by the Marquises of Worcester based at Raglan Castle. This party was mainly Anglican but with, damagingly, some Catholics, the most prominent of whom were the first two Marquises themselves. And, at the other extreme, the equally inveterate left-leaning Parliamentarians/Republicans who overlapped in religion with the Sectarians and who either would not accept the Restoration or were not accepted by it.\\n\\nThe core quest of the moderates was for a regime, which in an era when anarchy loomed, could provide firm stable rule fused with the upholding and dissemination of a Protestantism conservative enough to bolster the values/interests of the ruling elite. Thus these moderates were centrists, fearing both mass Protestant sectarianism/anarchy and Roman Catholicism, and in effect, post-Restoration, high Anglicans and Royalists (whether Anglican or Catholic) who supported Absolutism. However, post-1660 the moderates were themselves practically all Anglicans of some sort, at least outwardly.\\n\\nHow far this moderate model fits into the bloodier and most anarchic years of the Civil War/Interregnum of 1642–53 is questionable. It is hard to know how in these apocalyptic circumstances such a party could have organized itself or many potential members even been aware of each other. And that Seys could at that time be fitted in to such a tendency is even more questionable. There is no evidence yet unearthed of his political sympathies/activities until he comes to light as Recorder of Gloucester in 1649 when he was already 45. Thus he was serving the Rump in the very year of the regicide, which the Rump had authorized: no \"decent interval\" for Seys. This hardly fits a moderate mode. Then in 1652 the Rump endorsed him as a Bencher of his Inn. His subsequent seemingly seamless transition to working for the Protectorate (1653–9) may with this background appear as opportunism rather than moderation. A few moderate Anglicans/Royalists in Glamorgan and elsewhere did pragmatically and gingerly serve the Protectorate in the quest for stability: perhaps in South Wales disillusioned by the Catholicism of their erstwhile leaders, the Worcesters. But Seys's CV indelibly marks him as having come to \"moderation\" from the opposite radical/republican background, at least in his outward subscription. And the scale of his activities, the high office they earned him, rapidly made him a pillar of the regime of both Cromwells. However, the Protectorate did for a few years offer an opportunity to secure the moderates' key objectives. Secondly, Seys's transition from Rump to Protectorate can also be explained by each successive Interregnum regime and the local Republicans/Radicals needing each other very much as mutual props, especially in such Royalist areas as Glamorgan: if they did not hang together, they would hang separately. So anti-Royalists of all shades at the centre and the grassroots had to keep their considerable internal differences within bounds. Thus mere opportunism is too simple an explanation, although the personal aggrandisement of the likes of Jones and Seys strongly implies it was one element.\\n\\nIt was the failure of the last short-lived Republican regime in 1659 which itself had brought about the collapse of the equally short-lived rule of Richard Cromwell (\"Tumbledown Dick\") to carry such Interregnum \"worthies\" as Jones and Seys with it which doomed the Republicans. It appeared to be left-wing sectarian, and under it Quakerism was spreading fast enough in the arable lands of the Vale of Glamorgan, around Seys's Boverton, for example, to threaten squirearchical dominance there. The Quakers were hostile to tithes and rents, were then by no means pacifist, and indeed led locally by Roundhead veterans of the New Model Army. With the Cromwells gone, the Restoration of Charles II appeared to Seys (as to many others of the broad elite) as the only barrier to this threat of expropriation from fanatical populists.\\n\\nThe reign of Charles II was also vicissitudinous, but at least avoided the bloody anarchy and destruction of the Civil War. And a moderate party can be more clearly discerned in Glamorgan. Broadly, the interests of ex-Cromwellians (now born again as Anglicans and Royalists: prime examples Seys and Jones) continued to align with those of the true Royalists and of the regime in general throughout the 1660s. The threat to moderation was still thought to come from a possible Roundhead insurrection backed by Dutch arms (England was at war with the Netherlands 1665–7). As for Royalist reciprocation, Seys himself was made secure by a royal pardon in 1662 and was allowed to keep the rank of serjeant at law conferred on him by the Rump. Back home in Glamorgan, he was at some point put on the Commission of the Peace. Thereby he was re-admitted to at least some share in the governance of a county which he and his unpopular and unrepresentative clique had recently sought to dominate. The Bench of Justices was timehonoured in gentry eyes. Ideally it should be broad-based and representative (of themselves). Retrospectively, Seys might well have considered this measure of reintegration with the now predominant true royalists among his fellow gentry more advantageous than spearheading a precarious,provocative, quasi-revolutionary takeover of Glamorgan against its grain. Inclusion of ex-Cromwellites in such a traditional body also furthered the attainment of general as well as personal security.\\n\\nRegionally, the President of the Council of Wales was the Carmarthen-based Earl of Carbery, the biggest Welsh Cromwellian turncoat of the lot. Hence, he was probably a man after Seys's own heart, and Carbery certainly provided some insurance along with the more locally focussed Jones that those with his particular CV were relatively secure. Carbery, resident in South Wales and holding the most powerful Welsh office, was a more effective counterweight to the Marquis of Worcester than the time-honoured but absentee Earl of Pembroke, although Pembroke's South Welsh agents sustained his connection: see the 1666–8 land sales.\\n\\nBut as the 1670s got underway, the Roundhead/Dutch threat faded, to be replaced by that of a domestic Catholic coup backed by French arms: the opposite extreme. In Wales, Worcester replaced Carbery as President in 1672. He was, unlike his forebears, a strong and sincere Anglican, but this was not generally believed. Too many of Worcester's immediate family and entourage remained Catholics; one or two close relations were even ecclesiastics. He was a close friend of James, Duke of York, who embodied the lethal combination of heir to the throne and recent Catholic convert out and proud: hence, Worcester was widely, if erroneously, regarded as a crypto-Papist, his conversion to Anglicanism insincere: just a pretext to unite his formidable territorial interest with delegated Government power and command of the Chepstow garrison. In any case, the acknowledged true Anglicans surrounding him were extreme, keen on persecuting Dissenters while such as Seys wished to reach out to the more moderate of these in – within bounds – a Protestant ecumenicalism. There had been disputes in Glamorgan between high Anglicans and moderates as early as 1661. And Seys, given his record under the Interregnum, could as well have been accused of being a crypto-Dissenter as Worcester was of being a crypto-Catholic. The moderates emphasized the need to consolidate what moderate Protestantism there was in Wales against the allegedly fused perils of Popery and ignorance on one side, and on the other extreme Protestant sectarianism. Anti-Popery in Wales had a specific colouring based on the potential threat from neighbouring Ireland, which could be a springboard for French invasion. \\n\\nThe Welsh Trust was prepared to work with ejected Interregnum ministers to spread the word among the commonalty through preaching and translating edifying tracts into Welsh. They had after all the time and the mobility, unlike parish-bound conforming Anglican parsons. Even bishops such as Thomas of St David's favoured this co-operation. In the 1670s the Trust's known lay backers \"read like a roll-call of Worcester's enemies\" (Jenkins), and Evan Seys was prominent among them. The Restoration compromise was breaking down. It had depended on fudging a wide spectrum of semi-incompatible opinions. The essence was to let bygones be bygones as encapsulated in the Act of Oblivion of 1660 of which in descending order Carbery, Jones, and Seys were prime local beneficiaries. In the 1670s, however, Worcester regarded everyone who opposed his actions as crypto-Republicans/Dissenters, subversive of the House of Stuart: a tit-for-tat for their perceiving him as crypto-Papist. An ex-Cromwellian such as Seys was particularly easy to fit into his frame. This oversimplification, therefore caricature, gradually approached a self-fulfilling prophecy. The complex local reality came to be dominated over the course of the 1670s by two increasingly opposed and polarized factions. Seys and his like had very understandably never really been trusted by the local true Royalists. This may help explain why, having represented his native Glamorgan,a shire seat, under Richard Cromwell, he moved for the Restoration period to represent the erstwhile Republican/Puritan enclave of Gloucester, a less prestigious borough seat, but in a county where he had built up connections and interests both extensive and rooted. However,by the end of the 1670s such mistrust was overt. The decade culminated in the Popish Plot and the Exclusion Crisis. In the latter, Seys revamped his earlier role as an opponent of the Court and a member of the Country Party: he was an Exclusionist MP. In response, Worcester, leading the regional Royalist reaction, kicked Seys, despite his impressive legal credentials, off the Glamorgan Bench in 1680.\\n\\nThe 1670s, then, do not show Seys as a knee-jerk opportunist. Had he been so, he would have rushed to join the Worcester faction around 1672. He had his principles, or at least his position. This ex-Cromwellian and Puritan died in c.1685 a conforming Anglican protesting loyalty at least to King Charles II. But he had sympathy for moderate Dissenters among whom he had himself once been numbered and he wanted also to limit royal power. Complementarily, he was firmly anti-Catholic. Thus he ended up, whether he accepted the term or not, as a founder of the Whig Party.\\n\\nSeys reached his zenith under The Protectorate: considerable local then regional power was his springboard to national prominence. To be slightly anachronistic, he was as Attorney-General a member of Oliver's cabinet: in the inside set of the insiders. He weathered the Restoration well, but was never again admitted to the national engine-room. As an MP he was immediately edged out of his native Glamorgan which he had recently taken a big hand in ruling. The \"reconciled\" Cromwellians gradually faded, symbolised in South Wales by the replacement of Carbery in 1672 and the death of Jones in 1673. And a \"royalist reaction\" gathered force. Seys's age could not have helped: in 1670 he turned 66; quite a tally when many members even of the elite topped by Charles II and Cromwell themselves expired (well) short of sixty. So he faced the Worcesterian onslaught of the 1670s as an old, then as a very old man: in 1680 when Worcester sacked him, he turned 76: frankly, he should have been dead. That he was not only alive, but also still fighting his corner in Parliament, is a tribute to his physical stamina and to his tenacity. But, by then, even political players in their early fifties were young enough to be his sons. Was he, as a compromised survivor from the regicide past, an embarrassment to younger members of his own side and an easy target for their opponents, in the manner of former keen supporters of Fascist and Communist regimes around 1980? Certainly as a backer of the Welsh Trust and perceived enemy of Worcester, and then as an Exclusionist, he was marked out as an oppositionist, both regionally and nationally. Perhaps he was chivvied into opposition: his purging from the Bench while/because he was an Exclusionist MP bathed his position in the most glaring clarity. Chiaroscuro may well have been his shade of preference enabling him to cling on to at least some official power: he did not resign from his Glamorgan magistracy. Hence in 1658 he was prominent in a precarious Establishment; in 1681 he was still prominent, but in opposition to the restored Court: rather more precarious. In a superficial paradox, Seys \"adapted\" far better to the Restoration in the 1660s than in the 1670s when he might have expected to have been ever more deeply embedded into the current Establishment as time helped the memories of the interregnum to fade. Conversely, he retained property and concomitant \"interest\" in at least two shires, a seat in Parliament thereby, and until 1680 one on the Glamorgan bench. He remained the reverse of disinherited, disgraced, exiled and forgotten — let alone executed; fates which, variously or in combination, had befallen quite a few of his old Cromwellian comrades. And the future lay with the Whigs. Seys himself, however, may not have enjoyed such prescience: in the year of his death this future was still very effectively occluded.\\n\\nSeys, like many educated and intelligent gentlemen of his day, was also a noted antiquarian with probably a big library at Boverton Place, so some of his wealth was diverted to scholarly interests. The British Archaeological Association is currently (July 2010) posting on its website a book full of medieval charters and the like which once belonged to him. The books provided by his Stradling neighbours for Cowbridge School set him off on a scholarly trajectory which was not simply exploited for self-aggrandisement.\\n\\nIn his own will signed on 7 July 1682 (with a codicil dated 10 August 1684), Seys made proper provision for his daughters Margaret and Elizabeth (who appear to be still unmarried in middle age), and his heir was his son Richard. There is no reference to his wife, the former Miss Margaret Bridges, so she must have been already dead. The will breathes strikingly Protestant sentiment which must reflect his own beliefs rather than mere convention, because, as befitted a distinguished lawyer, he drew the document up himself in his own hand. His great age for the period meant he died within months of two much younger contemporaries with whom his life had intersected: King Charles II himself, and Sir Leoline Jenkins, although Jenkins survived until 1 September 1685, and he was on hand at the proving of the will on 23 February 1684/5. Jenkins and Seys were both politicized lawyers from the Vale of Glamorgan who had gone to the same school and subsequently done extremely well for themselves reaching what, shortly after their day, was to be termed the cabinet, although the younger man displayed more consistency of principle.\\n\\nSeys's descendants and wider kin maintained his Whig allegiance in a Tory county until the family left Boverton in the late eighteenth century. The religious tradition was maintained equally. One of his daughters left an endowment of £600 in capital for a weekly sermon at St Illtyd's Church in Llantwit Major in 1705. But Evan's direct male line ended with the death of his grandson in 1718. The Boverton estate passed to cousins, then out of the family altogether when Jane Seys, born 1750,conveyed it c 1770 to her husband, Robert Jones of Fonmon, interestingly a descendant of the famous Phillip. After her early death,childless, he promptly sold it. The property passed through various hands, the Place was demoted to a farmhouse,and was on the way to ruin in 1861: a condition which was fully attained not long afterwards. Nonetheless, some folk memory of Evan lingered: \" a majestic oak in the fold at Boverton\" was \"still shewn (to visitors) by thename of 'the sergeant's oak' \" in 1830. As Wordsworth had it near the same time re the vanished dwelling place of a much humbler family, \"yet the oak is left That grew beside their door\": into the 1830s at least.\\n\\n"}

Several artists have recorded it, but the best-known recording was by Barry McGuire. This recording was made between July 12 and July 15, 1965 and released by Dunhill Records. The accompanying musicians were top-tier LA session men: P.F. Sloan on guitar, Hal Blaine (of Phil Spector's \"Wrecking Crew\") on drums, and Larry Knechtel on bass. The vocal track was thrown on as a rough mix and was not intended to be the final version, but a copy of the recording \"leaked\" out to a DJ, who began playing it. The song was an instant hit and as a result the more polished vocal track that was at first envisioned was never recorded.\\n\\nThe song had initially been presented to The Byrds as a Dylanesque potential single, but they rejected it. The Turtles, another LA group who often recorded The Byrds' discarded or rejected material, recorded a version instead.

The song was also recorded by The Grass Roots and Jan and Dean in 1966.\\n\\nMcGuire also mentioned that \"Eve of Destruction\" was recorded in one take on a Thursday morning (from words scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper), and he got a call from the record company at 7:00 the following Monday morning, telling him to turn on the radio - his song was playing. The recording includes an \"ahhh\" where McGuire couldn't read the words.\\n\\nThe song is a grave warning of imminent apocalypse, and considered by some to be the epitome of a protest song. It expressed the frustrations and fears of young people in the age of the Cold War, Vietnam, the nuclear arms race, and the civil rights movement.\\n\\nBarry McGuire became a born-again Christian, and as a result renounced the song for many years, refusing to perform it. Though he's now known primarily as a singer of contemporary Christian songs, Barry McGuire has continued to sing \"Eve Of Destruction\" in recent years, often updating the lyrics to refer to such events as the Columbine High School massacre.\\n\\nBarry McGuire updated the lyrics when he performed at a reunion of folksingers, with the line \"Selma, Alabama\", replaced by the words \"Columbine Colorado\", referring to the student massacre of 1999. On March 12, 2008, Barry McGuire appeared on the Australian Music Comedy/Game Show Spicks and Specks, performing an updated version of \"Eve of Destruction\", with new lines such as \"You're old enough to kill/ you just started voting\" and \"...can live for ten years in space\". The reference to \"Red China\" was also removed.\\n\\nIn the first week of its release, the single was at number 103 on the ''Billboard'' charts. By August 12, Dunhill released the LP, \"Nick Featuring Eve of Destruction\". The LP reached its peak of number thirty-seven on the Billboard album chart during the week ending September 25. That same day the single went to number one on the chart, and repeated the feat on the Cashbox chart, where it had debuted at number thirty. McGuire was never again to break into the top forty of the Billboard Hot 100. It went to number one in Norway for two weeks.\\n\\nThe American media helped popularize the song by using it as an example of everything that was wrong with the youth of that time. The song also drew flak from conservatives. A group called The Spokesmen released an answer record entitled \"The Dawn of Correction\". A few months later, Green Beret medic Sgt. Barry Sadler released the patriotic \"Ballad of the Green Berets\". Johnny Sea's spoken word recording, \"Day For Decision\", was also a response to the song. The Temptations' song \"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)\" mentions the song title.\\n\\nThe song was banned by some radio stations in the USA and Radio Scotland. It was placed on a \"restricted list\" by the BBC, and could not be played on \"general entertainment programmes\".\\n\\nIn the late 1970s, Los Angeles punk band The Dickies recorded a cover of \"Eve of Destruction\". New Wave group Red Rockers covered the song in their 1984 album Schizoprenic Circus. Johnny Thunders recorded it on his 1984 album Hurt Me and also frequently covered the song in concert, while veteran Canadian punk outfit D.O.A. also covered the song on their 2004 album Live Free Or Die. The song has also been covered by Australian band Screaming Jets on their 1997 album  World Gone Crazy. Christian rock pioneer Larry Norman released his cover version on a maxi-single CD in 2004. Left-wing Christian punk band Crashdog also covered it on their album Cashists, Fascists, and Other Fungus. Post-Industrial psychedelic rock outfit Psychic TV released \"Eve Ov Destruction\" as a limited edition single in the late 1980s. In 2003, the reggae singer Luciano recorded a version of the song. The band Bishop Allen also released a song titled \"Eve of Destruction\" on their 2003 album, \"Charm School\" which takes its chorus from this song.\\n\\nThe song was briefly featured on Stephen King's 1994 miniseries  The Stand. With a burning Des Moines, Iowa as a backdrop, Larry Underwood sits atop the hood of a car, belting out the song to amuse himself until interrupted by another survivor of the superflu. It also appeared in The Simpsons episode GABF16, \"The Girl Who Slept Too Little,\" and was also featured in Michael Winterbottom's 1997 film Welcome to Sarajevo. A Joey Scarbury cover was played repeatedly in the original airing of The Greatest American Hero episode \"Operation Spoil Sport\" to encourage the hero to prevent an automated nuclear strike being triggered by a renegade U.S. general (the aliens who provided the hero's super-powers commandeered his car radio and tuned it to stations playing the song). Due to copyright issues, the song does not appear in the DVD version of the episode. A French translation is used in the closing credits of Michael Moore's film Sicko. An Italian version, \"Questo vecchio pazzo mondo\" (\"This old crazy world\"), was recorded by Gino Santercole in 1967; a 1984 recording by Adriano Celentano was included in his album I miei americani (a collection of US hits translated into Italian). This song also makes an appearance in \"The Doors\" (directed by Oliver Stone), as the opening act performs it before the Doors take the stage in Miami.\\n\\nThe song is played during the fourth season finale of The A-Team, \"The Sound of Thunder,\" when the team returns to Vietnam and flashbacks recall their tours of duty. The song is featured in the fourth level of the Vietnam War Video game Men of Valor. While the song is playing, the main character's lieutenant is dying of his wound on the battlefield.\\n\\nThe song, like many other popular songs of the day, gave its name to a gun truck used by United States Army Transportation Corps forces during the Vietnam war. The truck is on display at the U.S. Army Transportation Museum and is believed to be the only surviving example of a Vietnam era gun truck.\\n\\nESPN sportscaster Chris Berman, famous for inventing nicknames for sports figures, and often bringing song titles into the play on words, dubbed slugger Mark McGwire as \"Mark 'Eve of Destruction' McGwire\".\\n\\nThe indie rock group Bishop Allen perform a song named by the same name which borrows heavily from the original, but with an even more sharply apocalyptic theme. It includes the lyrics \"And if this moment is gone in a flash/ And my hand in yours becomes ash in ash\", followed in the next verse by an imagining of rejection from Heaven: \"Then we'll have a dance, yeah a dance, on the head of a pin/ Then God will grin, and shoo us away\".\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Evita (musical)", "body": "Evita is a musical production, with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. It concentrates on the life of Argentine political leader Eva Perón, the second wife of Argentinian president Juan Perón. The story follows Evita's early life, rise to power, charity work, and eventual death.\\n\\nEvita began as a rock opera concept album released in 1976. Its success led to productions in London's West End in 1978, and on Broadway a year later, both of which enjoyed considerable success. A major 1996 film of the musical was made, starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas. The musical was revived in London in 2006. Evita has been given numerous professional tours and worldwide productions, and numerous cast albums have been recorded.\\n\\nIn 1972, Robert Stigwood proposed that Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice develop a new musical version of Peter Pan, but they abandoned the project. Rice then heard a radio play about Eva Duarte de Perón and approached Lloyd Webber with an idea for a musical collaboration based on her life. The more Rice investigated Eva Perón, going so far as to travel to Buenos Aires to research her life, the more fascinated he became by the woman; he even named his first daughter after her. The idea of writing a score including tango, paso doble, and similar Latin flavours intrigued Lloyd Webber, but he ultimately rejected the idea. Lloyd Webber decided instead to collaborate with Alan Ayckbourn on Jeeves, a traditional Rodgers and Hart-style musical based on the P.G. Wodehouse character, which proved to be a critical and commercial failure. Chastened, Lloyd Webber returned to Rice, and they began developing Rice's proposed musical. The authors of the 1996 book Evita: The Real Life of Eva Perón claim that the musical was based on Mary Main's biography The Woman with the Whip, which was extremely critical of Eva Perón. Though Rice praised the Main biography, it was never officially credited as source material. Rice suggested that they create a character known as Che to serve as a narrator and Greek chorus. It was not his intention to base him on Che Guevara, but when Harold Prince later became involved with the project, he insisted that the actors portraying Che use Guevara as a role model. In the 1996 film adaptation, the character returned to his more anonymous roots. This was also the case for the 2006 London revival.\\n\\nAs they previously had done with Superstar, the songwriting team decided to record Evita as an album musical and selected newcomer Julie Covington to sing the title role. Released in 1976, the two-disc set included Paul Jones as Juan Perón, Colm Wilkinson as Che, Barbara Dickson as Perón's mistress, and Tony Christie as Agustín Magaldi. Lloyd Webber and conductor Anthony Bowles presented the musical at the second Sydmonton Festival before making the recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Prior to its release, they played it for Harold Prince and invited him to become involved with the eventual staging. Prince agreed, commenting, \"Any opera that begins with a funeral can't be all bad\", but he advised them that he could not take on any new commitments for the next two years.\\n\\nIn Britain, Australia, South Africa, South America, and various parts of Europe, sales of the concept album exceeded those of Jesus Christ Superstar; in the United States, however, it never achieved the same level of success. Covington's recording of \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" (originally titled \"It's Only Your Lover Returning\") was released in October 1976. It reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart and enjoyed similar success internationally. Dickson's \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" also became a hit. In the U.S. and UK, respectively, Karen Carpenter and Petula Clark released cover versions of \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\".\\n\\nLloyd Webber and Rice reworked several elements of the musical before producing it for the stage. Some songs were dropped and some shortened, while others were introduced and some lyrics rewritten. The 1976 album and the stage version featured different versions of the dialogue between Eva and Perón during \"Dice Are Rolling.\" The earlier version concluded with \"Eva's Sonnet\", during which she reaffirms her vice-presidential aspirations. The stage version of \"Dice are Rolling\" concluded on a shorter version of the sonnet as Eva collapses due to her worsening illness. Additional lyrics were written for the stage version of \"Oh, What a Circus\".\\n\\nLloyd Webber and Rice approached Prince again, and he told them that he would be ready to start rehearsals in early 1978. When he began working on the project in May, he changed very little, other than deleting Che's rock number \"The Lady's Got Potential\". Prince requested a song he could stage to chart Perón's rise to power, and Rice and Lloyd Webber responded with the musical chairs number \"The Art of the Possible\", during which military officers are eliminated until only Perón remains. Inspired by the mural of Diego Rivera, Prince suggested the proscenium be flanked by artwork depicting the struggles of the Argentinian peasants. He jettisoned the original monochromatic costumes designed for the chorus members and dancers; instead, he had them go to charity and secondhand clothing shops to purchase costumes.\\n\\nEvita opened in London's West End on 21 June 1978, and on Broadway the following year.\\n\\nA wordless opening reveals a cinema in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 26 July 1952, where an audience is watching a film (\"A Cinema in Buenos Aires, 26 July 1952\"). During the film, an announcer interrupts with the message (begun in Spanish, but fading into English) that \"Eva Perón enteredimmortality at 8:25 hours this evening....\" The audience is heartbroken, and they sing \"Requiem for Evita\" (in Latin, which is modeled on a Catholic requiem). Che, the narrator, cynically assesses the hysterical grief that gripped Argentina when Evita died (\"Oh What a Circus\").\\n\\nChe introduces the audience to 15-year-old Eva, in 1934. She has her first love affair with tango singer Agustín Magaldi (\"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\"). Eva blackmail Magaldi into taking her with him to Buenos Aires (\"Eva, Beware of the City\"). She reveals her hopes and ambitions when she arrives in the city for the first time (\"Buenos Aires\"). She soon dumps Magaldi, and Che relates the story of how Eva sleeps her way up the ladder, becoming a model, radio star, and actress (\"Goodnight and Thank You\"). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentinian politics and Eva's career may soon coincide (\"The Lady's Got Potential\"). This number was replaced in productions after the 1976 recording, with \"The Art Of The Possible,\" in which Colonel Juan Perón is fighting members of his political party to rise to the top.\\n\\nAt a \"Charity Concert\" held in aid of the victims of an earthquake in San Juan, Eva is reunited with Magaldi as he closes his act. Perón addresses the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva as soon as he exits. Eva and Perón share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Perón rise to power (\"I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You\"). Eva dismisses Perón's previous mistress (\"Hello and Goodbye\"), who ponders the rejection (\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\"). Eva moves into high society with Perón (\"Perón's Latest Flame\"), but is met with disdain from the upper classes and the Argentine Army. Perón runs for President, and has the Army imprison anyone who questions his campaign practices (\"A New Argentina\").\\n\\nPerón is elected President in a sweeping victory in 1946. He stands \"On The Balcony of the Casa Rosada\" addressing his descamisados (shirtless ones). Eva speaks from the balcony of the Presidential palace to her adoring supporters (\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" and \"On The Balcony of the Casa Rosada 2\"). Che looks at the price of fame as Eva dances at the Inaugural Ball with Perón, now Argentina's president-elect (\"High Flying, Adored\").\\n\\nEva insists on a glamorous image in order to impress the people of Argentina and promote Peronism. She prepares to tour in Europe as she is dressed for success by her fashion consultants (\"Rainbow High\"). Her famous 1946 tour meets with mixed results (\"Rainbow Tour\"); Spaniards adore her, but the Italians liken her to Benito Mussolini, France is unimpressed, and the English snub her by inviting her to a country estate, rather than Buckingham Palace. Eva affirms her disdain for the upper class, while Che asks her to start helping those in need as she promised (\"The Actress Hasn't Learned the Lines (You'd Like to Hear)\"). Eva begins the Eva Perón Foundation to direct her charity work. Che describes Eva's controversial charitable work, and possible money laundering (\"And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)\"). Eva appears at a church to take the sacrament in front of her adoring supporters (\"Santa Evita\"), but goes into a trancelike state, where she and Che heatedly debate her actions; Che accuses Eva of using the Argentinian people for her own ends, while Eva cynically replies that there is no glory in trying to solve the world's problems from the sidelines (\"Waltz for Eva and Che\"). At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits to herself and Che that she is dying and can't go on for much longer. Afterwards, Eva finally understands that Perón loves her for herself, not just for what she can do for him and his career (\"You Must Love Me\").\\n\\nPerón's generals finally get sick of Eva's meddling, and Perón reveals that though \"She is a Diamond\", Eva can no longer keep doing her work due to her cancer. The generals remind Perón that the only reason he is still in power is because of his wife's influence on the masses. Meanwhile, Eva is determined to run for vice president, much to Perón's fear that they would be overtaken by the military if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists she can continue on, despite her failing health (\"Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet\").\\n\\nRealizing she is close to death, Eva renounces her pursuit of the vice presidency and swears her eternal love to the people of Argentina (\"Eva's Final Broadcast\"). Eva's achievements flash before her eyes before she dies (\"Montage\"), and she asks for forgiveness, contemplating her choice of fame instead of long life and raising children (\"Lament\"). Eva dies, and embalmers preserve her body forever. Che notes that a monument was to be built for Evita \"Only the pedestal was completed, when Evita's body disappeared for 17 years....\"\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nThe musical employs an eclectic range of styles. Classical music in Evita includes the opening features a choral piece (\"Requiem for Evita\") and a choral interlude in \"Oh What a Circus\", as well as instrumental passages throughout the musical such as the orchestral version of the \"Lament\" and the introduction to \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\". Rhythmic latinate styles are heard in pieces such as \"Buenos Aires\", \"And the Money Kept Rolling in (And Out)\" and \"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\", while ballads include \"High Flying, Adored\" and \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\". Rock music includes \"Oh What a Circus\", \"Peron's Latest Flame\", and a song cut from the original production called \"The Lady's Got Potential\". The song was reinstated for the 1996 film with revised lyrics by Rice, and has also been used in Japanese, Czech, and Danish stage productions to expand on Argentine history for audiences less familiar with the subject.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe lyrics and storyline of the musical are based on Mary Main's biography, Evita: The Woman with the Whip, which drew heavily upon the accounts of anti-Peronist Argentines. Shortly after the musical appeared, Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro published a more neutral account of Eva Perón's life, titled Evita: The Real Lives of Eva Perón, in which they claim that many of Main's assertions (which had influenced Rice's lyrics) were false, such as the suggestion that Eva had first gone to Buenos Aires as the mistress of a married musician, Agustín Magaldi. Instead, they wrote, Eva's mother Doña Juana had taken her there when she aspired to become a radio actress. Critics also suggested that Rice's lyrics disparaged Evita's achievements unnecessarily, particularly her charity work.\\n\\nFollowing the success of the film version of Evita, in 1996, the government of Argentina released its own film biography of Peron, entitled Eva Perón: The True Story, asserting that it corrected distortions in the Lloyd Webber account.\\n\\nEvita opened at the Prince Edward Theatre on 21 June 1978 and closed on 8 February 1986, after 2,900 performances. Elaine Paige played Eva with David Essex as Che and Joss Ackland as Perón. Paige was selected from among many hopefuls, after Julie Covington declined the role. The production was directed by Harold Prince, choreographed by Larry Fuller, and produced by Robert Stigwood. Paige was succeeded by Marti Webb, Stephanie Lawrence, Siobhán McCarthy (who had played The Mistress when the show opened), Michele Breeze and lastly Kathryn Evans. Mark Ryan, who had first starred as Magaldi, later assumed the role of Che.\\n\\nIn his review in The Sunday Times, Derek Jewell called the show \"quite marvelous\" and described Lloyd Webber's \"ambitious\" score \"an unparallelled fusion of 20th century musical experience\" and Rice's lyrics as \"trenchant\" and \"witty\". Bernard Levin of The Times disliked it, however, calling it as an \"odious artefact ... that calls itself an opera ... merely because the clichés between the songs are sung rather than spoken\" and \"one of the most disagreeable evenings I have ever spent in my life\".\\n\\nthumbThe show opened at the Broadway Theatre on 25 September 1979 and closed on 26 June 1983, after 1,567 performances and 17 previews. Patti LuPone starred as Eva, with Mandy Patinkin as Che, Bob Gunton as Perón, and Jane Ohringer as Peron's mistress. Harold Prince directed with choreography by Larry Fuller. During the run, six actresses alternated playing the title role, in addition to LuPone: Terri Klausner, Nancy Opel, Pamela Blake (matinees), Derin Altay, Loni Ackerman and Florence Lacey (evenings). David Cantor understudied Patinkin and often performed as Che. \\n\\nLuPone has stated about her time in Evita:\" 'Evita' was the worst experience of my life,' she said. 'I was screaming my way through a part that could only have been written by a man who hates women. And I had no support from the producers, who wanted a star performance onstage but treated me as an unknown backstage. It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee.'\"\\n\\nThe musical's Spanish-language version premiered at the Teatro Monumental in Madrid on 23 December 1980, directed by Jaime Azpilicueta and with Paloma San Basilio as Eva, Patxi Andión as Che, Julio Catania as Perón, Tony Landa as Magaldi and Montserrat Vega as Perón's mistress. The song \"No llores por mí, Argentina\" became a hit single and was interpreted by singers like Nacha Guevara. The Spanish-language production later played in Barcelona and other cities, as well as in Latin American tours.\\n\\nThere have been numerous US and international touring productions of the show:\\n\\nOn 2 June 2006, the first major London production of Evita in 25 years opened in the West End at the Adelphi Theatre, directed by Michael Grandage with Argentine actress Elena Roger as Eva, Philip Quast as Perón and Matt Rawle as Che. Its song list included \"You Must Love Me\", written for the 1996 film, which had never been part of an English-language stage production. The production opened to rave reviews, but ticket sales were slow, and the production closed on 26 May 2007, after a run of less than 12 months. Quast and Roger received Olivier Award nominations for their performances in this revival.\\n\\nThe Stratford Shakespeare Festival produced Evita as its first rock musical from May 28 to November 6, 2010. The principal characters are played by Chilina Kennedy (Eva), Juan Chioran (Juan), and Josh Young (Che), with direction by Gary Griffin.\\n\\nSeveral sources, including the New York Post have reported that a Broadway revival of the West End production of Evita is planned for 2012 \"at a Nederlander theater\" and that Elena Roger will play the title role, along with Ricky Martin as Che, with direction by Michael Grandage and choreography by Rob Ashford. The show is being produced by Hal Luftig and Scott Sanders, and the tentative schedule is for rehearsals to begin sometime in January with an eye to performances beginning in April.\\n\\nPaige's replacements included Marti Webb, Stephanie Lawrence, Siobhán McCarthy, Kathryn Evans and Michele Breeze.\\n\\nFor the 2006 revival, Lloyd-Webber and Rice decided that it was best to hire an Alternate Eva, that would play the role on some occasions. Similar to the vocally demanding role of Christine in Lloyd-Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, the role of Eva would require an actress and singer who was fully capable of tackling the role.\\n\\nPlans for a film developed soon after the West End and Broadway openings. It was to have starred Barbra Streisand or Liza Minnelli as Eva, and Barry Gibb or Elton John as Che, and was to have been directed by Ken Russell. These plans never came to fruition.\\n\\nIt was not until 1996 that Evita came to the big screen. Alan Parker directed the film, with Madonna in the title role, Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Perón. The film was nominated for five Academy Award, winning one for Best Original Song (\"You Must Love Me,\" composed especially for the film).\\n\\nEvita came in sixth in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the UK's \"Number One Essential Musicals\".\\n\\nOne episode of The Simpsons, \"The President Wore Pearls\", has a plot loosely based on the musical, with Lisa Simpson in Eva's role. The episode includes parodies of songs such as \"Don't Vote for Me, Kids of Springfield\". At the end of the episode, a comical disclaimer is displayed stating, \"On the advice of our lawyers, we swear we have never heard of a musical based on the life of Eva Perón\".\\n\\nDuring \"Glee\", \"Special Education\", the characters Kurt Hummel and Rachel Berry sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' when Kurt is audititioning for a solo in the Warblers for Regionals.\\n\\nAt least 25 English language cast albums have been released, along with many foreign language recordings.

{"title": "Evolutionary invasion analysis", "body": "Evolutionary invasion analysis, also known as adaptive dynamics, is a set of techniques for studying long-term phenotypical evolution developed during the 1990s. It incorporates the concept of frequency dependence from game theory but allows for more realistic ecological descriptions, as the traits vary continuously and gives rise to a non-linear invasion fitness (the classical fitness concept is not directly applicable to situations with frequency dependence). \\n\\nThe basic principle of evolution, survival of the fittest, was outlined by thenaturalist Charles Darwin in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species. Though controversial at the time, the central ideas remainvirtually unchanged to this date, even though much more is now knownabout the biological basis of inheritance. Darwin expressed hisarguments verbally, but many attempts have since then been made toformalise the theory of evolution. The perhaps most well known arepopulation genetics which aim to model thebiological basis of inheritance but usually at the expense ofecological detail, quantitative genetics whichincorporates quantitative traits influenced by genes at many loci andevolutionary game theory which ignores geneticdetail but incorporates a high degree of ecological realism, inparticular that the success of any given strategy depends on thefrequency at which strategies are played in the population, a conceptknown as frequency dependence.\\n\\nAdaptive Dynamics is a set of techniques developed during the 1990sfor understanding the long-term consequences of small mutations in thetraits expressing the phenotype. They link population dynamics to evolutionary dynamics and incorporate and generalises thefundamental idea of frequency dependent selection from game theory.The number of papers using Adaptive Dynamics techniques is increasingsteadily as Adaptive Dynamics is gaining ground as a versatile toolfor evolutionary modelling.\\n\\nTwo fundamental ideas of Adaptive Dynamics are that the residentpopulation can be assumed to be in a dynamical equilibrium when newmutants appear, and that the eventual fate of such mutants can beinferred from their initial growth rate when rare in the environmentconsisting of the resident. This rate is known as the invasionexponent when measured as the initial exponential growth rate ofmutants, and as the basic reproductive number when it measuresthe expected total number of offspring that a mutant individual willproduce in a lifetime. It can be thought of, and is indeed sometimesalso referred to, as the invasion fitness of mutants. In order to make useof these ideas we require a mathematical model that explicitlyincorporates the traits undergoing evolutionary change. The modelshould describe both the environment and the population dynamics giventhe environment, but in many cases the variable part of theenvironment consists only of the demography of the currentpopulation. We then determine the invasion exponent, the initialgrowth rate of a mutant invading the environment consisting of theresident. Depending on the model, this can be trivial or verydifficult, but once determined, the Adaptive Dynamics techniques can beapplied independent of the model structure. \\n\\nA population consisting of individuals with the same trait is calledmonomorphic. If not explicitly stated differently, we will assume that thetrait is a real number, and we will write r and m for the traitvalue of the monomorphic resident population and that of an invadingmutant, respectively.\\n\\nThe invasion exponent  is defined as the expected growthrate of an initially rare mutant in the environment set by theresident (r), which simply means the frequency of each phenotype (traitvalue) whenever this suffices to infer all other aspects of theequilibrium environment, such as the demographic composition and theavailability of resources. For each r the invasion exponent can bethought of as the fitness landscape experienced by an initially raremutant. The landscape changes with each successful invasion, as is the case in evolutionary game theory, butin contrast with the classical view of evolution as an optimisationprocess towards ever higher fitness.\\n\\nWe will always assume that the resident is at its demographicattractor, and as a consequence  for all r,as otherwise the population would grow indefinitely. \\n\\nThe selection gradient is defined as the slope of the invasionexponent at , . If the sign of the invasion exponent is positive (negative) mutants withslightly higher (lower) trait values may successfully invade. This follows from the linear approximation \\n\\nwhich holds whenever .\\n\\nThe invasion exponent represents the fitness landscape as experiencedby a rare mutant. In a large (infinite) population only mutants withtrait values  for which  is positive are able tosuccessfully invade. The generic outcome of an invasion is that themutant replaces the resident, and the fitness landscape as experiencedby a rare mutant changes. To determine the outcome of the resultingseries of invasions pairwise-invasibility plots (PIPs) are often used.These show for each resident trait value  all mutant trait values for which  is positive. Note that is zero at the diagonal . In PIPs the fitness landscapes asexperienced by a rare mutant correspond tothe vertical lines where the resident trait value  is constant.\\n\\nThe selection gradient  determines the direction ofevolutionary change. If it is positive (negative) a mutant with aslightly higher (lower) trait-value will generically invade andreplace the resident. But what will happen if  vanishes?Seemingly evolution should come to a halt at such a point. While thisis a possible outcome, the general situation is more complex. Traitsor strategies  for which , are known asevolutionarily singular strategies. Near such points the fitnesslandscape as experienced by a rare mutant is locally `flat'. There are three qualitativelydifferent ways in which this can occur. First, a degenerate case similar to the qubic wherefinite evolutionary steps would lead past the local 'flatness'. Second, a fitness maximum which is known as an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and which, once established, cannot be invaded by nearbymutants. Third, a fitness minimumwhere disruptive selection will occur and the population branch intotwo morphs. This process is known as evolutionary branching. In a pairwise invasibility plot the singular strategies are found where theboundary of the region of positive invasion fitness intersects thediagonal. \\n\\nSingular strategies can be located and classified once theselection gradient is known. To locate singular strategies, it issufficient to find the points for which the selection gradientvanishes, i.e. to find  such that . These canbe classified then using the second derivative test from basiccalculus. If the second derivative evaluated at  is negative(positive) the strategy represents a local fitness maximum (minimum).Hence, for an evolutionarily stable strategy  we have\\n\\nIf this does not hold the strategy is evolutionarily unstable and,provided that it also convergence stable, evolutionary branching willeventually occur. For a singular strategy  to be convergencestable monomorphic populations with slightly lower or slightly highertrait values must be invadable by mutants with trait values closer to. That this can happen the selection gradient  in aneighbourhood of  must be positive for  and negative for. This means that the slope of  as a function of at  is negative, or equivalently\\n\\nThe criterion for convergence stability given above can also beexpressed using second derivatives of the invasion exponent, and theclassification can be refined to span more than the simple casesconsidered here.\\n\\nThe normal outcome of a successful invasion is that the mutantreplaces the resident. However, other outcomes are also possible; in particular both the resident and the mutantmay persist, and the population then becomes dimorphic. Assuming that atrait persists in the population if and only if its expectedgrowth-rate when rare is positive, the condition for coexistence amongtwo traits  and  is\\n\\nand\\n\\nwhere  and  are often referred to as morphs.Such a pair is a protected dimorphism. The set of all protecteddimorphisms is known as the region of coexistence. Graphically,the region consists of the overlapping parts when a pair-wiseinvasibility plot is mirrored over the diagonal \\n\\nThe invasion exponent is generalised to dimorphic populations in astraightforward manner, as the expected growth rate of a rare mutant in the environment set by the two morphs  and. The slope of the local fitness landscape for a mutant close to or  is now given by the selection gradients\\n\\nand\\n\\nIn practise, it is often difficult to determine the dimorphicselection gradient and invasion exponent analytically, and one oftenhas to resort to numerical computations.\\n\\nThe emergence of protected dimorphism near singular points during thecourse of evolution is not unusual, but its significance depends onwhether selection is stabilising or disruptive. In the latter case,the traits of the two morphs will diverge in a process often referred to as evolutionary branching. Geritz 1998 presents a compellingargument that disruptive selection only occurs near fitness minima. Tounderstand this heuristically consider a dimorphic population and  near a singular point. By continuity \\n\\nand, since \\n\\nthefitness landscape for the dimorphic population must be a perturbationof that for a monomorphic resident near the singular strategy.\\n\\nEvolution after branching is illustrated using trait evolutionplots. These show the region of coexistence, the direction ofevolutionary change and whether points where points where theselection gradient vanishes are fitness maxima or minima. Evolutionmay well lead the dimorphic population outside the region ofcoexistence, in which case one morph is extinct and the populationonce again becomes monomorphic.\\n\\nAdaptive dynamics effectively combines game theory and population dynamics. As such, it can be very useful in investigating how evolution affects the dynamics of populations. One interesting finding to come out of this is that individual-level adaptation can sometimes result in the extinction of the whole population/species, a phenomenon known as evolutionary suicide.\\n\\n"}

The station also provides direct access to Lower Manhattan, with connections to the New York City Subway at the World Trade Center PATH station. PATH service to 33rd Street in Midtown Manhattan is also available, via transfer at Newport.\\n\\nThe Hudson-Bergen Light Rail has a stop outside the Exchange Place PATH station, providing service to north to Hoboken and North Hudson and south to Liberty State Park and Bayonne \\n\\nThe original Exchange Place station opened on July 19, 1909 at the western end of the Downtown Hudson Tubes adjacent to Pennsylvania Railroad station and ferry terminal. The above ground entrance and platforms were reburbished in the late 1960s / early 1970s after the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took over operations of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad.\\n\\nIn the early years of the H&M Railroad, there were a number of incidents, including a derailment on April 26, 1942 that resulted in five deaths and over 200 injuries. In that incident, the train operator Louis Vierbucken was charged with manslaughter, as he was under the influence of liquor.

Eventually, EO 9066 cleared the way for the relocation of Japanese Americans to internment camps.\\n\\nBetween 1861 and 1940, approximately 275,000 Japanese immigrated to Hawaii and the mainland of the United States the majority arriving between 1898 and 1924. Japanese controlled less than 4 percent of California’s farmland in 1940, but they produced more than 10 percent of the total value of the state’s farm resources. Envy over economic success combined with distrust over cultural separateness and long standing anti-Asian racism turned into a disaster when the Empire of Japan Attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Lobbyist in the United States gain American support and pressured Congress and the President to remove persons of Japanese descent from the west coast.\\n\\nThe order authorized the Secretary of War and U.S. armed forces commanders to declare areas of the United States as military areas \"from which any or all persons may be excluded,\" although it did not name any nationality or ethnic group. It was eventually applied to one-third of the land area of the U.S. (mostly in the West) and was used against those with \"Foreign Enemy Ancestry\" — Japanese.\\n\\nThe order led to the internment of Japanese Americans or AJAs (Americans of Japanese Ancestry); some 120,000 ethnic Japanese people were held in internment camps for the duration of the war. Of the Japanese interned, 62% were Nisei (American-born, second-generation Japanese American and therefore American citizen) or Sansei (third-generation Japanese American, also American citizens) and the rest were Issei (Japanese immigrants and resident aliens, first-generation Japanese American).\\n\\nJapanese Americans were by far the most widely affected group, as all persons with Japanese ancestry were removed from the West Coast and southern Arizona. As then California Attorney General Earl Warren put it, \"When we are dealing with the Caucasian race we have methods that will test the loyalty of them. But when we deal with the Japanese, we are on an entirely different field.\" In Hawaii, where there were 140,000 Americans of Japanese Ancestry (constituting 37% of the population), only selected individuals of heightened perceived risk were interned.\\n\\nAmericans of Italian and German ancestry were also targeted by these restrictions, including internment. 11,000 people of German ancestry were interned, as were 3,000 people of Italian ancestry, along with some Jew refugees. The Jewish refugees who were interned came from Germany, and the U.S. government didn't differentiate between ethnic Jews and ethnic Germans (jewish was defined as religious practice). Some of the internees of European descent were interned only briefly, and others were held for several years beyond the end of the war. Like the Japanese internees, these smaller groups had American-born citizens in their numbers, especially among the children. A few members of ethnicities of other Axis countries were interned, but exact numbers are unknown.\\n\\nSecretary of War Henry L. Stimson was responsible for assisting relocated people with transport, food, shelter, and other accommodations.\\n\\nFBI Director J. Edgar Hoover opposed the internment, not on constitutional grounds, but because he believed that the most likely spies had already been arrested by the FBI shortly after the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was also opposed to Executive Order 9066. She spoke privately many times with her husband, but was unsuccessful in convincing him not to sign it.\\n\\nExecutive Order 9066 was rescinded by Gerald Ford on February 19, 1976. In 1980, Jimmy Carter signed legislation to create the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC). The CWRIC was appointed to conduct an official governmental study of Executive Order 9066, related wartime orders, and their impact on Japanese Americans in the West and Alaska Natives in the Pribilof Islands.\\n\\nIn December 1982, the CWRIC issued its findings in Personal Justice Denied, concluding that the incarceration of Japanese Americans had not been justified by military necessity. The report determined that the decision to incarcerate was based on \"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.\" The Commission recommended legislative remedies consisting of an official Government apology and redress payments of $20,000 to each of the survivors; a public education fund was set up to help ensure that this would not happen again (Public Law 100-383).\\n\\nOn August 10, 1988, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, based on the CWRIC recommendations, was signed into law by Ronald Reagan. On November 21, 1989, George H.W. Bush signed an appropriation bill authorizing payments to be paid out between 1990 and 1998. In 1990, surviving internees began to receive individual redress payments and a letter of apology.\\n\\n9066\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Executive Orders", "body": "Executive Orders is a political and military thriller novel by Tom Clancy. It was published in 1996, and is a canonical part of the 'Ryanverse'.\\n\\nJack Ryan is sworn in as President of the United States minutes after becoming Vice-President. With most of Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. military, much of the senior staff of the Executive Office of the President, the Supreme Court, and all but two members of the Cabinet dead in a terrorist attack committed by a lone Japan Air Lines pilot (avenging the death of his son and brother in Debt of Honor), Ryan is left to represent the United States virtually all by himself. This novel follows Ryan as he deals with various hardships and crises, ranging from domestic and foreign policy, to reconstituting the House and Senate, a challenge to his legitimacy by his Vice-Presidential predecessor, scandal-tainted Ed Kealty, and a brewing war in the Middle East. After learning that the majority of the government is dead, two anarchists decide to capitalize on the situation by killing both Ryan and Ed Kealty, using a cement truck filled with an ANFO mixture. \\n\\nWhen the President of Iraq (at the time of publication, the book referred to then-President Saddam Hussein although he is only mentioned once by name) is assassinated by an Iranian member of his own security detail, the leader of Iran (Ayatollah Mahmoud Haji Daryaei) takes advantage of the power vacuum and launches an unopposed invasion of Iraq, uniting the two countries into one called the United Islamic Republic (UIR).\\n\\nThe fictional United Islamic Republic as described in the book.\\n\\nWith assistance from India and the People's Republic of China, the UIR plans to transform itself into a superpower by conquering Saudi Arabia. Following a series of Iranian-backed terrorist attacks designed to cripple the United States, including a failed kidnap attempt on Ryan's youngest daughter and a biowarfare attack using a new Iranian-developed airborne strain of the extremely lethal Ebola virus, the UIR goes to war against Saudi and Kuwait forces and the few uninfected American units are rushed to the region to stand by them. Ryan restricts interstate travel, and closes schools and businesses to reduce the virus spreading. The biowar attack fails for a reason well known to virologist: Ebola outbreaks quickly exterminate a small group of people, then burn out because they run out of new hosts; other viruses that kill less efficiently manage to spread to larger communities.\\n\\nHe also orders the country into martial law during this time, which inadvertently prevents the anarchists' assassination attempt because interstate travel has been prohibited. During a routine police check at a truck stop, one of the anarchists panics, drawing police attention to their unusual truck. \\n\\nIn a matter of days, with the combined strength of the Kuwaiti, Saudi Arabian and American armies, they begin to seriously damage the UIR's military resources, soldiers and morale by destroying two entire corps of the UIR's army. Eventually, the triumvirate of the three countries win the war.\\n\\nAt the same time, President Ryan calls Ding Chavez and John Clark into a secret mission. They set up a laser guidance device in an apartment facing Daryaei's home, allowing US aircraft to target a precision bomb upon it. Simultaneously, during a press conference, President Ryan shows the destruction of Daryaei's residence on live national television and tells the international community that they will only hurt those who are specifically responsible for attacking America. Ryan assassinates Daryaei just after another attempt on Ryan's life (similar to the previous assassination of the President of Iraq), by an Iranian sleeper agent in the U.S. Secret Service, is foiled and the assassin arrested. \\n\\nRyan threatens to bomb biowarfare targets in Tehran unless the surviving people responsible for the biowarfare attacks are extradited to America to face charges.\\n\\nAfterwards, the American people accept their new President, and he decides that he will in fact run for election to a term in his own right.\\n\\nThe book is so named because President Ryan governs mainly by issuing executive order, as opposed to working with the Congress to pass legislation or deferring to state and local governments. This is because most of Congress, as well as the Supreme Court and most of the cabinet were killed in the same terrorist action which elevated Jack to the Presidency. In particular, acting on advice of his wife, a physician, in regard to the biological weapon threat, Ryan restricts interstate travel by executive order. In a move designed to embarrass and undermine Ryan's presidency, resigned Vice-President Ed Kealty files a lawsuit alleging Ryan acted unconstitutionally in restricting the travel of US citizens. While ruling in Kealty's favor on constitutional grounds, the lawsuit also ends Kealty's claim to the Presidency, since he inadvertently acknowledges Ryan as President.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Exhibition Stadium", "body": "Canadian National Exhibition Stadium (more commonly known as Exhibition Stadium or CNE Stadium) was a multi-purpose stadium, that formerly stood on the Exhibition Place grounds, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\\n\\nExhibition Stadium was actually the fourth stadium to be built on the site since 1879. The covered north-side grandstand was constructed in 1948, followed by a south bleacher section for football in 1959. When converted for football in 1959, the stadium seated 33,150. The stadium was reconfigured again in the mid-1970s to allow the expansion Toronto Blue Jays to play there, with additional seating opposite the covered grandstand on the first base side and curving around to the third base side. It was the only major league stadium where the bleachers were covered but the main grandstand was not.\\n\\nOriginally built for Canadian football, the Canadian National Exhibition and other events, the stadium served as the home of the Toronto Blue Jays, of Major League Baseball, from 1977-1989. It also served as the home of the Toronto Argonauts, of the Canadian Football League, from 1959-1988. The stadium hosted the Grey Cup game twelve times, over a 24-year period.\\n\\nThe stadium hosted concerts by many famous artists, including The Police, The Jacksons, Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, Robert Plant, David Bowie, Phil Collins, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston, Jonathan Butler, Kenny G, Madonna, Level 42, Van Halen, Bon Jovi, KISS, U2, The Rolling Stones, Def Leppard, Cher, Aerosmith, Metallica, The Black Crowes, Warrant, Warrior Soul, Dio, Bonham, AC/DC, Guns N' Roses, Paul McCartney, Faith No More and Pink Floyd, among others.\\n\\nIn 1999, the stadium was demolished, with the site being used for parking until 2006. BMO Field, a soccer-specific stadium for Toronto FC, was built on the site and opened in 2007.\\n\\nthumbExhibition Stadium was problematic for hosting baseball. Like most multi-purpose stadiums, the outfield seats were far from the field. This was magnified by the fact that Canadian football fields are 30 yards longer, and considerably wider, than American football fields. Combined with the vaguely horseshoe-shape of the stadium, this resulted in many of the seats down the right field line and in the bleachers in right-centre being extremely far from the infield; they actually faced each other rather than the action. In fact, some seats were as far as 820 feet from home plate — the farthest such distance of any stadium ever used as a principal home field in the majors. \\n\\nThe left-field bleachers were the only seats that offered protection from the elements. Ironically, they were the cheapest seats. The only other seats that offered a decent view of the game were directly behind the plate. Most other seats looked away from the field. Several bleacher seats in left-centre and several permanent seats down the right-field line were so far from the field that the Blue Jays didn't even sell them during the regular season.\\n\\nRelatively close to Lake Ontario, the stadium was often quite cold at the beginning and end of the season. The first Blue Jays game played there on April 7, 1977 was the only major league game ever played with the field covered entirely by snow. The Blue Jays had to borrow Maple Leaf Gardens' Zamboni to clear off the field. Conditions at the stadium led to another odd incident that first year. On September 15, Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver pulled his team off the field because he felt the bricks holding down the bullpen tarps were a hazard to his players. This garnered a win by forfeit for the Jays. It remains the last time in major league baseball history that a team deliberately forfeited a game (as opposed to having an umpire call a forfeiture due to unruly fan behaviour).\\n\\nAn April 30, 1984 game against the Texas Rangers was postponed due to 60 mph winds. Prior to the game, Ranger manager Doug Rader named Jim Bibby as his starting pitcher, stating that \"he's the heaviest man in the world, and thus will be unaffected by the wind.\" However, Bibby would never make it to the mound. Two Rangers batters complained about dirt swirling in their eyes, and Blue Jays starting pitcher Jim Clancy was blown off balance several times. The umpires stopped the game after only six pitches. After a 30-minute delay, the game was called off. \\n\\nThe stadium also occasionally had problems with fog, once causing a bizarre inside the park home run for Kelly Gruber when an otherwise routine pop up was lost by the outfielders in the thick fog.\\n\\nBecause of the variable climate and the stadium's multiple tenants in 1976, the original grass surface was replaced with AstroTurf.thumb\\n\\nDue to its position next to the lake, and the food disposed by baseball and football fans, the stadium was a popular feeding ground for seagull. New York Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield was arrested on August 4, 1983 for killing a seagull with a baseball. Winfield had just finished his warm-up exercises in the 5th inning and threw a ball to the ball boy, striking a seagull in the head. the seagull died, and some claimed that Winfield hit the bird on purpose, which prompted Yankees manager Billy Martin to state \"They wouldn't say that if they'd seen the throws he'd been making all year. It's the first time he's hit the cutoff man\". The charges were later dropped. Winfield would later play for the Blue Jays, winning a World Series with the club in 1992.\\n\\nExhibition Stadium's fate was sealed during the 70th Grey Cup, popularly known as \"the Rain Bowl\" because it was played in a driving rainstorm. Many fans were forced to spend most of the game in the concession area because their seats offered no protection from the elements. By 1983, officials with Metro Toronto, the Blue Jays and Argonauts agreed to abandon Exhibition Stadium once a domed stadium could be built closer to Toronto's downtown. The decision to build a retractable roof stadium – the second in North America, and the first with rigid roof panels – along with engineering and cost questions meant that SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) was not completed until . If not delayed, it would have been the first retractable roof in North America; Olympic Stadium in Montreal finally got its retractable roof to work in 1988. However, the Montreal design was problematic — soon after it was put into use it ripped on several occasions. In the months that followed, it was plagued by further rips and even leaks whenever it rained, bringing water down into the stadium. It was shut down for good in 1989, and replaced by a fixed roof in 1992. For this reason, SkyDome is sometimes said to have been the first fully-functioning retractable roof in North America.\\n\\nExhibition Stadium lay mostly dormant over the decade following the opening of SkyDome, except for the occasional concert or minor sporting event. The World Wrestling Federation, (now World Wrestling Entertainment) needing a new venue after a decision to discontinue traditional events at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1995, held one card there on August 24th, 1996 for a crowd of 21,211. The main event was Shawn Michaels V.S. Goldust in a ladder match. The stadium was demolished in 1999 and the site became a parking lot. A few chairs from the stadium can be found on the southeast corner just north of the bridge to cross over to Ontario Place's main entrance. The remaining chairs were sold off to collectors during the dismantling of the stadium.\\n\\nAlthough not widely used while the stadium was in operation (given the well known references to Cleveland's Municipal Stadium), the term has been used more recently in reflection by Toronto media to refer to the now-demolished venue.\\n\\nOn October 26, 2005, the City of Toronto approved $69 million CAD to build a new 20,000 seat stadium in almost the same spot where the old Stadium once was. The governments of Canada and Ontario combined for $35 million CAD, with the city paying $9.8 million CAD, and Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment paying the rest, including any runoff costs. Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment got the naming rights of the new stadium, and has a Major League Soccer team in the new stadium, named Toronto FC. The stadium, called BMO Field, also held the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup along with other cities in Canada.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Exhibition game", "body": "An exhibition game (also known as an exhibition match, exhibition, demonstration, demo, exhibit or friendly) is a sporting event in which there is no competitive value of any significant kind to any competitor (such as tournament or season rankings, or prize money) regardless of the outcome of the competition. The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team. Quality of play is generally valued over the end result. The term scrimmage is also sometimes used, especially with regard to team sports, but is ambiguous because it has other meanings even in that context. Another synonym is preparation match.\\n\\nThroughout the world, many team and one-on-one sports and games feature exhibition matches. For example, two professional snooker or chess players, or two ice hockey teams, may play an exhibition to settle a challenge, to provide professional entertainment, or often to raise money for charities.\\n\\nIn some sports, especially in North America, exhibition games also take the form of a handful of pre-season games that are intended to familiarize teammates with each other and prepare for upcoming matches. In professional sports, pre-season games also help teams decide which players to keep for the regular season.\\n\\nthumbIn the early days of association football, friendly matches (or \"friendlies\") were the most common type of match. However since the development of The Football League in England in 1888, league tournaments became established, in addition to lengthy cup tournaments. By the turn of the millennium, national leagues were established in almost every country, as well as regional leagues for lower level teams, thus the significance of friendlies has seriously declined since the 19th century.\\n\\nToday most club sides play a number of friendlies before the start of each season (called pre-season friendlies). Friendly football matches are considered to be non-competitive and are only used to 'warm up' players for a new season/competitive match. There is generally nothing competitive at stake and some rules may be changed or experimented with (such as unlimited substitutions and no cards). Although most friendlies are simply one-off matches arranged by the clubs themselves, in which a certain amount is paid by the challenger club to the incumbent club, some teams do compete in short tournaments, such as the Emirates Cup, Teresa Herrera Trophy and the Amsterdam Tournament. Although these events may involve sponsorship deals and the awarding of a trophy and may even be broadcast on television, there is little prestige attached to them.\\n\\nInternational teams also play friendlies, generally in preparation for the qualifying or final stages of major tournaments. This is essential, since national squads generally have much less time together in which to prepare. The biggest difference between friendlies at the club and international levels is that international friendlies mostly take place during club league seasons, not between them. This has on occasion led to disagreement between national associations and clubs as to the availability of players, who could become injured or fatigued in a friendly.\\n\\nInternational friendlies give team managers the opportunity to experiment with team selection and tactics before the tournament proper, and also allow them to assess the abilities of players they may potentially select for the tournament squad. Players can be booked in international friendlies, and can be suspended from future international matches based on red cards or accumulated yellows in a specified period. Caps and goals scored also count towards a player's career records. In 2004, FIFA ruled that substitutions by a team be limited to six per match in international friendlies, in response to criticism that such matches were becoming increasingly farcical with managers making as many as 11 substitutions per match.\\n\\nIn the UK and Ireland, \"exhibition match\" and \"friendly match\" refer to different types of matches. The types described above as friendlies are not termed exhibition matches, while annual all-star matches such as those held in the US MLS or Japan's J. League are called exhibition matches rather than friendly matches. A one-off match for charitable fundraising, usually involving one or two all-star teams, or a match held in honour of a player for service to his/her club, may be described as exhibition matches but they are normally referred to as Charity football match and testimonial match respectively.\\n\\nUnder the 1995–2004 National Hockey League collective bargaining agreement, teams were limited to nine preseason games. From 1975 to 1991, NHL teams sometimes played exhibition games against teams from the Soviet Union in the Super Series, and in 1978, played against World Hockey Association teams also in preseason training. Like the NFL, the NHL sometimes schedules exhibition games for cities without their own NHL teams. In the 2000s, some preseason games were played in Europe against European teams, during the NHL Challenge series, the most recent matchup being between the Chicago Blackhawks and ZSC Lions in 2009.\\n\\nIn 1992, goaltender Manon Rheaume played in a preseason game for the Tampa Bay Lightning, becoming the first woman to suit up for a male pro sports team in North America.\\n\\nThe Flying Fathers, a Canadian group of Catholic priests, regularly tour North America playing exhibition hockey games for charity. One of the organization's founders, Les Costello, was a onetime NHL player who was ordained as a priest after retiring from professional hockey. Another prominent exhibition hockey team is the Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team, which is composed almost entirely of retired NHL players, the majority of whom (as the name suggests) played at least a portion of their career for the Buffalo Sabres.\\n\\nAmerican college hockey teams occasionally play exhibition games against Canadian college teams as well as against USA or Canadian national teams. (In men's hockey, the senior national teams are selected from NHL and other pro players, and college teams would be overmatched against those teams even if they were allowed to play them. However, the national under-18 teams are made up of amateurs.)\\n\\nMajor League Baseball's preseason is known as spring training. All MLB teams maintain a spring-training base in Arizona or Florida. The teams in Arizona make up the Cactus League, while the teams in Florida play in the Grapefruit League. Each team plays about 30 preseason games against other MLB teams. They may also play exhibitions against a local college team or a minor-league team from their farm system.\\n\\nSeveral MLB teams used to play regular exhibition games during the year against nearby teams in the other major league, but regular-season interleague play has made such games unnecessary. The two Canadian MLB teams, the Toronto Blue Jays of the American League and the Montreal Expos of the National League, met annually to play the Pearson Cup exhibition game; this tradition ended when the Expos moved to Washington, D.C. for the 2005 season. It also used to be commonplace to have a team play an exhibition against Minor League affiliates during the regular season, but worries of injuries to players, along with travel issues, have made this very rare. The annual MLB All-Star Game, played in July between players from AL teams and players from NL teams, was long considered an exhibition match, but as of 2003 this status is questioned because the All-Star pennant-winner has been awarded home field advantage for the upcoming World Series.\\n\\nNational Basketball Association teams play about seven preseason games per year. Nowadays, NBA teams almost always play each other in the preseason. However, from 1971 to 1975, NBA teams played preseason exhibitions against American Basketball Association teams. In the early days of the NBA, league clubs sometimes challenged the legendary barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters, with mixed success. The NBA has played preseason games in Europe and Asia. In the 2006 and 2007 seasons, the NBA and the primary European club competition, the Euroleague, conducted a preseason tournament featuring two NBA teams and the finalists from that year's Euroleague. \\n\\nTraditionally, major college basketball teams would begin their seasons with a few exhibition games. They would play traveling teams made up of former college players or, on occasion, other countries' national teams such as Athletes in Action or a team sponsored by Marathon Oil. However, in 2003, the National Collegiate Athletic Association banned games with non-college teams. Some teams have begun scheduling exhibition games against teams in NCAA Division II and Division III. Major college basketball teams may still travel to other countries once every few years during the summer to play in exhibition games.\\n\\nNational Football League teams play four or five pre-season exhibition games a year. These exhibition games are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster to the regular-season limit of 53 players. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it. \\n\\nThe Pro Bowl, played after the end of the NFL season, is also considered an exhibition game.\\n\\nCollege football teams do not play exhibition games (due to the importance of opinion poll in college football, even exhibition games would not truly be exhibitions because they could influence the opinions of those polled), although many play a public intramural exhibition game in the spring mainly to promote the team and give new recruits an early chance at public game action.\\n\\nHigh school football teams frequently participate in controlled scrimmages with other teams during preseason practice, but exhibition games are rare because of league rules and concerns about finances and player injuries. A more common exhibition is the high school football all-star game, which brings together top players from a region. These games are typically played by graduating seniors during the summer. Many of these games are used as showcases for players to be seen by colleges.\\n\\nAustralian rules football has been introduced to a wide range of places around Australia and the world since the code originated in Victoria in 1859. Much of this expansion can be directly attributed to exhibition match by the major leagues in regions and countries where the code has been played as a demonstration sport.\\n\\nVarious auto racing organizations hold exhibition events, more specifically, races that do not count towards the season championship. The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series holds one exhibition event annually, the invitation-only Budweiser Shootout at the start of the season. The top seven teams of each manufacturer from the previous season compete in the event which awards cash prizes only, and no points towards the Sprint Cup championship. A second event, the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race is also a non-points paying race; however, it is falls under the category of all-star events. NASCAR also held exhibition races previously at Suzuka Circuit, Twin Ring Motegi, and Calder Park Thunderdome.\\n\\nOther historical examples of non-championship races include the Marlboro Challenge in IndyCar racing and the TOCA Touring Car Shootout in the British Touring Car Championship. Until the mid-1980s there were a significant number of non-championship Formula One races.\\n\\nThe National Hot Rod Association Pro Stock teams will have a pre-season drag meet held before the traditional start in Pomona. The Pro Stock Showdown is a pre-season drag meet held for the Pro Stock teams held at The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.\\n\\n"}

The data listed for a specific substance is usually a rough prediction based upon gas behavior theory (see Chapman-Jouguet condition), as in practice it is difficult to measure. Explosive velocities are always faster than the local speed of sound in the material. \\n\\nIf the explosive is confined before detonation, such as in an artillery shell, the force produced is focused on a much smaller area, and the pressure is massively intensified. This results in explosive velocity that is higher than if the explosive had been detonated in open air. Unconfined velocities are often approximately 70 to 80 percent of confined velocities. \\n\\nExplosive velocity is increased with smaller particle size, increased charge diameter, and increased confinement. \\n\\nTypical detonation velocities in gases range from 1800 m/s to 3000 m/s. Typical velocities in solid explosives often range beyond 4000 m/s to 10300 m/s.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Express Payment System", "body": "right\\n\\nThe Express Payment System, more commonly known as the EPS, was the EFTPOS system originally of the ATM cards of Bank of the Philippine Islands and its subsidiaries, BPI Family Savings Bank and BPI Direct Savings Bank. Today, it is the EFTPOS system of the Expressnet interbank network in the Philippines. The system is the most popular EFTPOS system for ATM cardholders in the Philippines and is accepted nationwide. Rivals of the network include MegaLink's PayLink and the similarly-named BancNet Payment System (BPS).\\n\\nAlthough the Philippines is largely still a cash-based society, the EPS is slowly but surely getting widespread prominence. Since its launch, it has expanded to be found in many stores nationwide and has since expanded from its roots with BPI, which also pioneered Expressnet. In fact, the EPS is no longer limited to shopping: the EPS can also be used for things such as paying doctor's fees or paying for a haircut with the swipe of one's ATM card. Currently, there are more than 8,200 EPS merchants throughout the Philippines.\\n\\nIn 2005, the EPS expanded to include the ATM cards of Banco de Oro and Land Bank of the Philippines, both Expressnet members. However, many EPS merchants claim that their EPS terminal works only with BPI ATM cards or do not know how to use Banco de Oro or Landbank cards with the EPS terminal; this is because virtually all EPS terminals are BPI terminals (Banco de Oro and Landbank EPS terminals debuted just recently). Also, Banco de Oro and Landbank ATM cards, unlike BPI ATM cards, cannot be directly swiped on an EPS terminal. In order to use these cards, an EPS merchant must enter the number 7 on the main screen then swipe the card to use these ATM cards. As of 2005, HSBC and its subsidiary, HSBC Savings Bank, although both members of Expressnet, do not participate in the EPS system, meaning that HSBC and HSBC Savings Bank ATM cards cannot be used on an EPS terminal.\\n\\nIn addition to functioning as an ATM EFTPOS terminal, EPS terminals also accept BPI credit, debit and prepaid cards. However, these transactions are considered as BPI Express Credit transactions and not as EPS transactions.\\n\\nBanco de Oro has its own terminal independent of the EPS either branded under the SM name or under its own name. Terminals under either name accept all Banco de Oro cards (Smarteller ATM card and derivatives, BDO Gift Card, BDO Cash Card and BDO credit cards) and have the functions of an EPS terminal. Terminals under the SM name, however, have extended capabilities such as having the capabilities of an EPS, PayLink and BPS terminal (and even the ATM cards of non-affiliated banks) all in one as well as the acceptance of other banks' credit, debit and prepaid cards.\\n\\nThe terminal can be found depending on the name. Terminals under the SM name can be found in all SM stores, such as their supermarkets, department stores and stores such as Surplus Shop and Toy Kingdom. Terminals under the Banco de Oro name can be found in businesses that accept Banco de Oro cards before Banco de Oro joined the EPS. Some merchants though still use the Banco de Oro terminal.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Extended school time", "body": "Extended school time is a proposal in the United States for increasing the number of mandatory hours per week that students spend at school.\\n\\nThe 1983 report by the U.S. National Commission on Excellence in Education, A Nation at Risk, suggested that expectations, content, and time needed to be improved in American education. Since then increasing the amount of time in school became a hot topic, and for the past few years, the proposal saw a resurgence of interest in response to NCLB, with dozens of proposals around the nation to extend the school year. In December 2009, President Obama proposed that American school children extend their time in class, either by lengthening the school day or the school year. \\n\\nStudents in the United States spend much less time in school than do students in most other industrialized nations, and the school year has been essentially unchanged for more than a century. Various studies have yielded widely different results in regard to the correlation between school time and academic achievement. Massachusetts 2020 and its national affiliate, the National Center on Time &amp; Learning, are resources for an enlarging group of states and districts that are exploring expanded learning time—several of which, including Oklahoma, Alabama, and Rhode Island, have launched new initiatives in 2010. In 2006, Massachusetts 2020 worked with state leaders in Massachusetts to spearhead the Massachusetts Expanded Learning Time Initiative, the first-in-the-nation statewide initiative to expand the school day. In 2010-2011, 19 schools in 10 school districts will have schedules increase learning time by 300 hours across the school year.\\n\\nResearch suggests that expanding instructional time is as effective as other commonly discussed educational interventions intended to boost learning, such as increasing teacher quality and reducing class size. It also suggests that the added high-quality teaching time particularly benefits certain groups of students, such as low-income students and others who have little opportunity for learning outside of school. Researchers caution that not all time in school is equal. The correlation between time and achievement increases exists only when students are given more instructional time and academic learning time. Other researchers conclude that more time spent in the classroom will have little impact on academic achievement if it isn't accompanied by other education reforms. They show that the key to student learning gains is the quality of the teacher, not the amount of time spent in school. Some homeschooler families are objective of the proposal on the basis that longer school time takes more away from family time. Cost is another major factor; though like per pupil costs, hard to generalize across states, due to differences in geography, cost-of-living costs, right-to-work vs. union states, etc. In 1990, cost estimates ranged from $2.3 to $121.4 million per day, depending on the state.\\n\\n"}

For example, it is common in naive set theory to introduce a symbol  for the set which has no member. In the formal setting of first-order theories, this can be done by adding to the theory a new constant  and the new axiom , meaning 'for all x, x is not a member of '. It can then be proved that doing so adds essentially nothing to the old theory, as should be expected from a definition.

The tube contains no optical elements; its sole purpose is to move the lens farther from the image plane. The farther away the lens is, the closer the focus, the greater the magnification, and also the greater the loss of light (requiring a longer exposure time). Lenses classically focus closer than infinity by moving all optical elements farther from the film or sensor; an extension tube simply imposes this movement. \\n\\nExtension tubes without electrical contacts will not allow an electronic automatic camera to control the lens, thus disabling autofocus and in some cases forcing a user to shoot wide open unless the lens offers manual aperture control. More expensive extension tubes contain electrical contacts allowing the user to use autofocus and electronically control the aperture of the attached lens. A great advantage to the non-electrical tubes is their low price. Since no electronics or optics is involved, it is usual to find rings for as cheap as $4 USD.\\n\\nOther items like lens adaptors may unintentionally have an effect similar to an extension tube.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Extreme Associates", "body": "Extreme Associates, formerly known as Extreme and Extreme 2.0, is a pornographic film producer, featuring a catalog of DVD titles and Internet content. It is owned by Rob Zicari (\"Rob Black\") and his wife Janet Romano (\"Lizzy Borden\"). The studio's material is controversial, with its films often featuring erotic humiliation and rough sex. Extreme has faced legal charges of obscenity in the U.S. It is associated with another adult film company, Evolution Erotica.\\n\\nthumbExtreme Associates evolved from Rob Zicari's former company, Extreme Video. It became known as Extreme Associates in 1997 when Zicari, Tom Byron and Van Damage broke away from Patrick Collins' Elegant Angel and formed their own company. Tom Byron and Van Damage have since left the company. Janet Romano started to work for Zicari in 1998, first as an actress and then as a director. \\n\\nIn 2003, it was indicted by the U.S. federal government on obscenity charges. The company is known for being controversial, as it has engaged in public relations wars with Vivid Video, Patrick Collins and his company Elegant Angel, Paul Fishbein and his publication Adult Video News, and Larry Flynt.\\n\\nExtreme Associates has been featured on America's Most Wanted, Nightline with Ted Koppel and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and also in publications such as TIME Magazine and Details Magazine. The company is the subject of the documentaries: PBS Frontline: American Porn (2002) and The Porn King vs. The President, and co-owner Lizzy Borden recently stated that there are more documentaries about the company in the process of being filmed.\\n\\nExtreme Associates operated a professional wrestling promotion called Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW) from 1999 to 2003.\\n\\nIn March 2006 Extreme became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Shots Video Netherlands. The Dutch company is responsible for series like Men’s Lounge, Bi Sex, Clinic Sex and Deep Throat Anal. Shots had been the exclusive European distributor for Extreme Associates since 2004.\\n\\nIn April 2006 Extreme films were added to AdultRental.com's video on demand service.\\n\\nStarting in May 2006 the studio's content could be downloaded to the iPod and PSP. \\n\\nIn February 2007 Extreme signed a deal to be the exclusive distributor of all-black studio Baller Nation's films.\\n\\nIn September 2007 the company announced it would be halting DVD sales, and would be distributing content exclusively through its video on demand service, ExtremeVOD.com, which was launched in February 2006. The decision was taken due to the general downturn in porn DVD sales, and the refusal of some retailers to stock the studio's films.\\n\\nExtreme posts approximately one hour's worth of free content on numerous \"porn tube\" websites every month, in the form of clips lasting just a few minutes. Black thinks the various 'Porn 2.0' user-generated content sites are useful for spreading brand awareness, even if it is difficult to measure how much this increases sales.\\n\\nThe filming of Lizzy Borden's movie Forced Entry, which included several simulated rape, was covered in the PBS Frontline documentary American Porn which aired on February 7, 2002; the makers of the documentary were repulsed and walked off the set. Zicari was interviewed in the documentary; he defended the company's content and challenged Attorney General John Ashcroft to take action against him. Zicari stated in an interview for the program, \"We've got tons of stuff they technically could arrest us for. I'm not out there saying I want to be the test case. But I will be the test case. I would welcome that. I would welcome the publicity. I would welcome everything, to make a point in, I guess, our society\". These scenes possibly led to the subsequent undercover operation by federal authorities.\\n\\nOn April 8, 2003, the premises of Extreme Associates were raided by federal agents, and five videos were seized. The United States Postal Inspection Service and the Pornography Unit of the Los Angeles Police Department's Organized Crime and Vice Division had conducted the investigation leading to the indictment. On September 5, 2002 a U.S. postal inspector had joined the Extreme website. Postal inspectors then viewed clips on the site, and ordered three videotapes which were sent to a postal agent in Pittsburgh. On August 6, 2003 Black, Borden and the company were indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh on ten counts of the production and distribution by mail and the Internet of obscene pornographic materials. Zicari and Romano faced a maximum total sentence of fifty years in prison, a fine of $2,500,000, or both. Extreme Associates, Inc. faced a maximum total sentence of a term of probation of fifty years and a fine of $5,000,000. The prosecution also sought forfeiture of the films charged in the indictment, all gross profits from the distribution of the films, and all property used to facilitate the alleged crimes, including the domain name extremeassociates.com. At the time it was the first major federal obscenity prosecution in ten years.\\n\\nZicari's company is located in North Hollywood near Los Angeles, however the indictment and trial took place in the Western District of Pennsylvania, from where undercover agents had ordered the offending materials, and video clips had been downloaded. Extreme also posted videotapes and DVDs to a distributor in the district. It has been alleged the authorities chose this area of Pennsylvania because they believed a conviction for obscenity would be easier to achieve in that socially conservative district than in California, as a jury would be more likely to agree the material offended the standards of its local community, which is part of the Miller Test used to judge obscenity in the U.S. thumbThe trial has been seen as a test case of the acceptable limits of pornography.Mary Beth Buchanan was the federal prosecutor in the case. In an interview on 60 Minutes she said, \"We have just had a proliferation of this type of material that has been getting increasingly worse and worse. And that's why it's important to enforce the law, and to show the producers that there are limits. There are limits to what they can sell and distribute throughout the country\" Ms. Buchanan has also stated that \"The lack of enforcement of federal obscenity laws during the 1990s has led to a proliferation of obscenity throughout the United States, such as the violent and degrading material charged in this case.\" Buchanan has said that Zicari's comments on the Frontline program \"helped us to determine that this was not a producer who was trying to comply with the law\"\\n\\nZicari remained in business during the trial; he continued to market and sell the five tapes that are at the center of the prosecution as The Federal Five, with a portion of the sales price going to his defense fund. Note that buyers of those materials do not break the law, since mere possession of obscenity (unlike production and distribution) is not illegal. The involved movies are\\n\\nThe prosecution also charged the defendants with transmitting six obscene video clips over the Internet through the extremeassociates.com website. The six video clips were entitled \"valeriejospit\", \"jewel\", \"PZ Summer Breeze\", \"dp-gangbang-7gen-X\", \"miacum\" and \"analasspirations1\", and ranged in length from 37 seconds to two minutes, 54 seconds.\\n\\nDuring a hearing in November 2004, Zicari's lawyer H. Louis Sirkin argued that the right to privacy gave individuals the constitutional right to view offending materials in private, a right which cannot be meaningfully exercised without a corresponding right of companies to distribute such materials. The prosecution countered that an individual's right to privacy is unrelated to a company's right to commercial distribution.\\n\\nThe defense moved to dismiss the indictments on the grounds that federal obscenity statutes violated the constitutional guarantees of privacy and liberty that were protected by the due process clause. Referencing Lawrence v. Texas and Stanley v. Georgia the defense argued there is a fundamental right to sexual privacy which includes the right to possess and view sexually explicit material in one's own home. The defense argued that this right was not affected by the fact that the material does not have any literary or artistic merit, and that since the federal obscenity laws imposed a complete ban on materials which people have the right to possess, they were unconstitutional. \\n\\nOn January 20, 2005, District Court Judge Gary L. Lancaster dropped the charges, agreeing with the defense that the federal anti-obscenity statutes were unconstitutional, as they violated a person's fundamental right to possess and view whatever they want in the privacy of their own home. As a fundamental right had been violated, the government had to establish that a compelling state interest was involved. The prosecution argued that the government had a legitimate interest in protecting adults from unwitting exposure to obscenity, and protecting children from exposure to obscenity. These arguments were rejected by the court, which also ruled that the federal obscenity laws were not narrow enough to meet these interests, and could not justify a complete ban on obscene material. Lancaster ruled that children and unwitting adults are protected from the content because the website requires a credit card to join, and because software is available by which parents can restrict children's access to Internet pornography. The court did agree with the government that Lawrence had not created a new broad fundamental right to engage in any private sexual conduct. Instead the court relied on Stanley, which had established there was a fundamental right to private possession of obscene material. The court did rely on Lawrence for its assertion that the government could not use public morality as a legitimate state interest which justified the infringement of consensual, adult, private sexual conduct. The court also made reference to the dissenting opinion of Justice Scalia, who said that Lawrence had questioned the validity of U.S. obscenity laws, since the government could not enforce a moral code of conduct. Judge Lancaster also cited numerous constitutional scholars who had observed that the Lawrence ruling calls federal obscenity laws into question.\\n\\nThe Department of Justice (at the time headed by Alberto Gonzales) announced on February 16, 2005 that it would appeal the ruling. That appeal was filed with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on April 11, 2005, argued on October 19, 2005, and decided on December 8, 2005. The appeals court reversed the lower court and reinstated the suit against Zicari and Romano, ruling that the lower court had erred in setting aside the federal obscenity statutes, which had been repeatedly upheld in Supreme Court decisions.\\n\\nOn March 11, 2009 Extreme Associates and its owners plead guilty to the reinstated obscenity charges to avoid trial effectively shutting down the company. Extreme Associates also apparently took its website down concurrent with the plea.\\n\\nThe studio has produced film series and one-off films including;Anal Blitzkrieg, Ass Clowns, Ass-Hole O Mio, Big Fat F.N. Tits, Black Cock Smokers, Cock Smokers, Cock Suckers, Cocktails, Creampie Milkshakes, Cum Catchers, Depravity in Deutschland, Euro Cuntz, Extreme Amateurs, Extreme Brazil, Extreme Gang Bang, Extreme Teen, Extremely Yours, Face Down Ass Up, Filth Files, Filthy Lil' Porn-A-Bees, From the Balcony, Fuck Pigs, Geisha Gash, German Whore Fare, Ghetto Bitches, Go Fuck Yerself, Goo Gallery, Great American Ass, House of Whores, In The Days of Whore, Last Breath, Let Us Prey, Lewd Archives, Lower Extremities, Luciano's Lucky Ladies, Man Smokers, Oral Hygiene, S.I.D.S., Slap Happy, Spank Those Bitches, Spare Parts, The Adventures Of Mammary Man And Jugg Woman, The Adventures Of Porno Man, Whack Attack and What Lurks in the Shadows.\\n\\nExtreme Associates bills itself as having the hardest hardcore pornography on the Internet. The studio's content has been described as \"extremely violent\", \"shocking\", \"slasher porn\" and \"patently offensive\". In an interview with Salon.com Borden said of Extreme's content, \"It's disgusting but I like to watch it because it's shocking\". Borden and Zicari compare their films to slasher films and some reality television, which people watch in order to be shocked. Talking to ABC News about his films, Zicari said, \"You might not like what you had just seen. It might have disturbed you, it might have repulsed you, it might have given you all sorts of emotions. But are you going to limit and be that person that has the right to say 200 million other citizens cannot watch that because you don't like it?\"\\n\\nSlap Happy is a rough sex series, created and directed by Brandon Iron and distributed by EA. The scenes are filmed in a gonzo style and feature male dominance. Iron is the sole male performer in all scenes. Each scene features Iron with one female performer who performs fellatio. Iron holds the female performer's head stationary with his hands, while continually slap her in the face and verbally abusing her as she continues fellating him. In many scenes, the woman vomits as a result of being gagged by Iron's penis. Iron initially offered the series to 34 companies before Black agreed to distribute it.\\n\\nthumbActresses who have worked for Extreme Associates include Alana Evans, Alexandra Nice, Amber Lynn, Anastasia Blue, Ashlyn Gere, Bridget the Midget, Heather Gables, Iroc, Jasmin St. Claire, Jessica Darlin, Jewel De'Nyle, Juanita Chong, Kendra Jade, Kristi Myst, Lizzy Borden (who is also a producer and director), Monique DeMoan, Nikita Denise, Stryc-9, Tiffany Mynx, and Veronica Caine (formerly Barrett Moore). Pro wrestler Nicole Bass did some non-sex bondage videos for Extreme in 2000. \\n\\nKristi Myst broke down during the filming of In The Days of Whore. After having had anal sex for several hours with three men she was told that she had to do anal with another seven men, although she had not agreed to this before the shoot. At this point Myst began crying and wanted to walk off the set and quit the business rather than complete her scene. She eventually relented after being consoled by Tom Byron. Brandon Iron who was present has said the incident was \"the foulest thing I have ever witnessed\" on a porn shoot.\\n\\nAshlyn Gere performed in several films after making a comeback from retirement. She appeared in titles including House of Whores and the Extremely Yours: Ashlyn Gere compilation.\\n\\nGia Paloma had a contract with the studio until she left in May 2006. She was formerly married to EA director Coffee Ron. Kristi Myst also used to be an EA contract girl. Paris Gables is currently the company's main contract star, and has also directed. Gables initially went under contract in January 2005. By February 2006 she had appeared in almost a dozen films, and agreed to a one-year contract extension.\\n\\nthumbExtreme's current directors are Rob Black, Lizzy Borden, Shane Bugbee, Mark Zane (also known as Alias), Ivan E. Rection, Chris Justice (also known as Chris Evans), Coffee Ron, and Thomas Zupko. Extreme's former directors include Matt Zane, Ashlyn Gere, David Luger, Derek Newblood, Gene Ross, Jane Waters, Luis Cypher (also known as Bobby Darlin), Luciano (Michael Stefano), Scott Snot, Slain Wayne (Eric Brummer), Smiley Johnson, Tiffany Mynx, Tom Byron, Brandon Iron and Van Damage.\\n\\nMichael Stefano began his directing career with Extreme Associates in the mid-1990s under the name Luciano, before leaving to direct for Red Light District Video and other studios.\\n\\nThomas Zupko initially directed for the company from 2000 till 2003. His debut film was In the Days of Whore. After leaving he worked for Elegant Angel, Sin City and Hustler Video, before returning to Extreme as a contract director in May 2006. The first film of his second stint was Lisa Ann Defiled.\\n\\nChurch of Satan member Shane Bugbee directs the satanism-themed Club Satan series. The first title, Club Satan: The Witches Sabbath was released in early 2007. Several crew-members and performers walked off the set of the film when an actor was asked to ejaculate upon and then smash a model of Jesus Christ's head. Actor Rick Masters said that Bugbee had \"gone too far\".\\n\\nBrandon Iron alleges that Rob Black asked him to direct Slap Happy 5 when he had not paid him for any of the previous four films. Iron also alleges that Extreme has often knowingly paid performers with bad cheques, and often pays performers late. He also criticizes the allegation on Extreme's website that Jewel De'Nyle's father committed incest, and alleges that Extreme evades tax by paying retailers and distributors cash in hand. \\n\\nPresident of Adult Video News Paul Fishbein has said EA produces \"horrible, unwatchable, disgusting, aberrant movies\"\\n\\nThe following is a selection of major awards EA has won:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eóganachta", "body": "The Eóganachta (English: Eugenians) or Eoghanachta were an Irish dynasty centred around Cashel which dominated southern Ireland from the 7th to the 10th centuries, and following that, in a restricted form, the Kingdom of Desmond, and its offshoot Carbery, well into the 16th century. By tradition the dynasty was founded by Conall Corc but named after his ancestor Éogan, the firstborn son of the semi-mythological 3rd century king Ailill Aulom. This dynastic clan-name, for it was never in any sense a 'surname,' should more accurately be restricted to those branches of the royal house which descended from Conall Corc, who established Cashel as his royal seat in the late fifth century.\\n\\nAs powerful as the Eóganachta were in Munster, they never provided Ireland with a High King. Serious challenges to the Uí Néill were however presented by Cathal mac Finguine and Feidlimid mac Cremthanin, who, although not recognized as high-kings or Kings of Tara, did control territories in their lifetimes the extent of which were as great as those of the Uí Néill. The kings of the Hill of Tara were sometimes called high-kings but were not recognized as kings of all Ireland in the historical period. However, this is to put the supposed office \"High King of Ireland\" on a platform that it probably never enjoyed. The social structure of Gaelic Ireland was extremely complex, heirarchically oriented and aristocratic in concept. At the summit of society stood the king of a province, variously styled in the law texts as \"King of great kings\" (), \"Chief of kings\" () and \"The ultimate king of every individual\" (). From his justice there was no appeal, nor did the Brehon Law acknowledge the existence of the high-kingship of Ireland. The ri ruirech had no legal superior. In Munster this legal theory was explicitly adhered to by the annalists who styled the provincial kings as \"High-king\" () thereby stressing his absolute sovereignty. As the concept of the high-kingship of Ireland was developed from the ninth century onwards by the Uí Néill clan, the kings of Munster counterbalanced this unhistorical doctrine by stressing their alternate right to that office or, in lieu, the enjoyment of full sovereignty in Leth Mogha, that part of Ireland lying south of an imaginary line drawn from Dublin to Galway.\\n\\nThe first undisputed Eóganacht king of Munster of note was the 7th century Faílbe Flann mac Áedo Duib, direct male line ancestor of the later MacCarthy kings.\\n\\nThe rule of the Eóganachta in Munster is widely regarded as gentle and more sophisticated in comparison with the other provincial dynasties of Ireland. Not only was Munster the wealthiest of the provinces, but the Eóganachta were willing to concede other previously powerful kingdoms whom they had politically marginalized, such as the Corcu Loígde, considerable status and freedom from tribute, based on their former status as rulers of the province. See Byrne 2001 for an extensive description of the kingdom.\\n\\nthumbTheir origins, possibly Gaulish, are very obscure. According to one of their own origin legends (Laud 610), they may not have been originally Irish. The proto-Eóganachta, from the time of Mug Nuadat to the time of Crimthann mac Fidaig and Conall Corc, are sometimes referred to as the Deirgtine in early sources.\\n\\nThe earliest evidence for the proto-Eóganachta, the Deirgthine or Deirgtine, is in the form of ogham inscriptions. They appear to have initially been subjects of the Dáirine, a warlike people with frequently mentioned connections to Ulster and who were possibly cousins of the Ulaid. The Dáirine were represented in historical times most clearly by the Corcu Loígde, over whom the Deirgtine finally achieved supremacy during the course of the 7th century, following the loss by the former of their centuries-long hold on the Kingdom of Osraige, apparently with some outside help from the Uí Néill.\\n\\nThe Eóganachta achieved their status primarily through political and economic sophistication and not military conquest. Ireland was dominated by several hostile powers whom they were never in any position to challenge militarily on their own, in the initial centuries, but there also existed a number of subject tribes whom the Deirgtine successfully convinced to adopt them as their overlords. The effect was to separate the Dáirine, by now mainly the Corcu Loígde, from their cousin kingdoms and prominent subjects. The Eóganachta progressively surrounded themselves with favoured vassals such as the Múscraige, who would become the main source of their income as well as defense against the other kingdoms. The later famous Déisi Tuisceart, who would produce Brian Bóruma, were among these vassal peoples. The Déisi Muman of County Waterford may have shared Gaulish origins with the Eóganachta themselves.\\n\\nAnother powerful people of early Munster were the Mairtine, who had their capital at Emly or Imlech Ibair, first known as Medón Mairtine. It became the head church of the Eóganachta.\\n\\nSee Nia Segamain, Áine, Lugaid mac Con, Battle of Mag Mucrama, Mug Ruith, Leath Mogha, Senchas Fagbála Caisil, Mór Muman, Óengus Bolg, Aimend.\\n\\nA number of the figures below may be listed under the wrong septs. The quality of Eóganachta genealogical and historical writing greatly improves in the 2nd millennium under the MacCarthy overlords but some problems remain. The earliest historical rulers from the Eóganachta, descendants of Conall Corc, include:\\n\\nThe princely houses of the Eóganachta may usefully be divided into the inner circle, the outer circle and extinct septs.\\n\\nright\\n\\nThese three princely houses produced nearly all Kings of Cashel from the 5th to the 10th centuries. Some were strong, others were renowned bishops and scholars, and others were weak. The importance of the Cashel kingship was primarily ceremonial, and rulers were with the occasionl exception not militarily aggressive... although they continually strove for political dominance as far as they could with the province's wealth. Strong petty kingdoms regarded as \"subject\" would receive large payments called rath in return for their acknowledgment of the political supremacy of Cashel, and they would sometimes give hostages as well. The most powerful petty kingdoms exchanged hostages with the King of Cashel, and though subject in some sense (by agreement), they were legally free and capable of terminating the contract.\\n\\nThe Eóganacht Chaisil under the MacCarthys would later form the much more militarily capable but unfortunately undermanned Kingdom of Desmond. The O'Sullivans were the most powerful lords under them. The O'Keeffes of Eóganacht Glendamnach would later produce many great soldiers for Irish and Continental armies. The O'Callaghans were a smaller sept who have since distinguished themselves in recent times, while the MacAuliffes and MacGillycuddys are as stated simply septs of the MacCarthys and O'Sullivans. The O'Kirbys of Eóganacht Áine were unfortunately ruined by the Norman Invasion of Ireland.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe two \"outer\" princely houses of the dynasty dwelt to the west and south of the central dynasties. Though descended from Conall Corc and thus theoretically entitled to hold the kingship, in effect these dynasties were excluded from Cashel politics, a situation which may or may not have been based on geographical realities. Powerful kings could become de facto Kings of Munster, but in general the central dynasties refused to recognize them as such, and this resulted in particular antagonism between Cashel and Eóganacht Locha Léin, the power of which was eventually broken. Eóganacht Raithlind was not as aggressive and so survived under O'Mahony rule well into the 2nd millennium. The O'Donoghues, originally from Eóganacht Raithlind, would move in to become the new princes of Eóganacht Locha Léin, and are still represented among the Irish nobles today by the Lord of Glenflesk (see below).\\n\\nOddly enough, the Eóganacht Raithlind, the Eóganacht Locha Léin, and the Uí Fidgenti-Liatháin (below), are all together referred to as the Three Eóganachta of Munster in early medieval story known as The Expulsion of the Déisi, which is strange in part because the first two were supposedly descended from Conall Corc and not Dáire Cerbba, but this grouping may be simply meant to illustrate that these were all free tribes in comparison with the rent-paying Déisi. The Eóganacht Locha Léin were themselves often viewed by the \"inner circle\" with surprisingly vicious hostility, and this somehow involved a connection to the Picts of Scotland. \\n\\nThe occasional misguided attempts to \"rank\" these powerful septs \"below\" those of the inner circle, or even to exclude them from the Eóganachta entirely, can be rejected. See also Iarmuman. \\n\\nThere are several extinct and/or unconfirmed septs:\\n\\nEóganachta dynastic surnames include MacCarthy, MacCarthy Reagh, O'Sullivan, O'Sullivan Beare, O'Mahony, O'Donoghue, O'Donoghue of the Glens, Moriarty, O'Keeffe, O'Callaghan, and Kirby, among many others, many of them of contested origin. MacAuliffe (or McAuliffe) is typically a MacCarthy sept. MacGillycuddy is an O'Sullivan (Mor) sept. O'Long is classed as Eóganacht (Raithlind). O'Driscoll is Corcu Loígde (Dáirine) but the family are related to the Eóganachta through early and late marriages and so qualify as natural kin. O'Leary can be either Corcu Loígde or Uí Fidgenti or Eóganacht depending on the sept. O'Carroll of Éile may or may not be distantly related to the Eóganachta. Scannell was also a sept of some significance.\\n\\nOut of the approximately 150 surviving Irish surnames of princely or comital origins, the Eóganachta and their allies account for approximately 30, or about one fifth. Unfortunately their pedigrees are often hopelessly disorganized and confused and so it is difficult or impossible to tell in many cases which people belong to which septs, or in fact if they even belong to the Eóganachta at all. There is also great evidence in the pedigrees and regnal lists of repeated modification, outright fabrication, and unceremonious deletion, at least for the early period (all concerned sources), with some criticisms quite severe, although this is also a problem with Connachta and Laigin material.\\n\\nthumbSometimes also included are the Uí Fidgenti (O'Donovan, Ó Coileáin, O'Connell, others) and the related Uí Liatháin (Lyons, Gleeson, others), ancient allies of the Eóganachta who may have originally belonged to the Dáirine, although it is also possible they were earlier or peripheral branches of the descendants of Ailill Flann Bec, or of Ailill Aulomm, not involved in the innovative Cashel politics of the descendants of Conall Corc, actual founder of the Eóganachta dynasties. In this way, the children of Fidach, the early monarch Crimthand Mór mac Fidaig and his sister Mongfind, also belong to the peripheral Eóganachta. But only the descendants of Conall Corc, son of Luigdech or Lugaid, son of Ailill Flann Bec, could claim Cashel, whereas all three of these more distantly related aristocracies appear to descend from Dáire Cerbba and/or Maine Munchaín, so-called brother(s) of Lugaid. In any case, both the Uí Fidgenti and Uí Liatháin were apparently fading, for whatever reasons, while the Eóganachta were in their prime. They paid no obvious tribute but were little involved in the political scene after a period, the terms of the alliance being only that they were expected to support the Eóganachta militarily on \"honour related\" expeditions outside Munster or in the defence of it. The Uí Fidgenti did exchange hostages with the King of Cashel, just like the Eóganacht Raithlind and Eóganacht Locha Léin were honoured, and so they appear to have been viewed as kin from an early period, even if they may have been Dáirine to begin with or included very substantial elements. In the earliest genealogies, mostly found in Rawlinson B 502, they are in some way kin to the Eóganachta, even if only through marriage at first as suggested by some later interpreters.\\n\\nAccording to Rawlinson B 502, Dáire Cerbba was born in Brega, County Meath, but no explanation is given. This might mean his family were even later arrivals to Munster than the Eóganachta and help explain their lack of centralization and well known colonies in Britain. The Uí Fidgenti (NW) and Uí Liatháin (SE) were in opposing corners of Munster with the Eóganacht Áine and Eóganacht Glendamnach more or less in between, as well as the Fir Mag Fene. Brega bordered on the territory of the Laigin, and was originally a part of it. Against this is the fact that the Uí Fidgenti had their own capital at Dún Eochair in Munster, constructed by the Dáirine several centuries before the rise of Cashel, as described by Geoffrey Keating.\\n\\nrightIt has been suggested that the Kings of the Picts were derived from a sept of the Eóganachta. If so, then the Eóganacht Locha Léin, and thus the ancestors of the O'Moriartys and others, are the most obvious candidates. Not only were they at one point expansive as the powerful Kingdom of Iarmuman, but they were also frustrated by their exclusion and forced isolation by the inner circle. Glaringly, they were said to descend from a Pictish woman, and this was sometimes given as the reason for their isolation. The inner circle exhibited peculiar attitudes from time to time and so this could have been the real story.\\n\\nSee Byrne (2001), Cathal mac Finguine, Feidlimid mac Cremthanin, Synod of Birr.\\n\\nIn some later traditions of Thomond, Eógan had a younger brother, Cas, who is said to have originated the rival Dál gCais dynasty of Ireland, although this has been disproven. The smaller Dál gCais kingdom proved to have surprising military might, and displaced the increasingly beset Eóganachta, who were suffering also from attacks by the Vikings and the Uí Néill, on the Munster throne during the course of the 10th century. From this the Eóganachta and their allies would never fully recover, but they did continue, largely in the form of the MacCarthys and O'Sullivan, to assert their authority and rule large parts of Desmond for the next six centuries. They would badly rout the FitzGerald at the Battle of Callann, halting the advance of the Normans into Desmond, and win back many territories briefly held by them.See Byrne (2001), Todd (1867), Brian Bóruma, Mathgamain mac Cennétig, Cennétig mac Lorcáin, Kings of Munster, Kings of Desmond, Thomond, County Clare, Déisi.\\n\\nSee FitzGerald, Battle of Callann, Earl of Desmond, Desmond Rebellions, Second Desmond Rebellion, Florence MacCarthy, Tudor conquest of Ireland, Dónall Cam Ó Súilleabháin Béirre, Siege of Dunboy, Plantations of Ireland, Irish Confederate Wars, Donagh MacCarthy, Viscount Muskerry, Earl of Clancarty.\\n\\nSee Byrne (2001). \\n\\nSee O'Hart (1892), Cronnelly (1864), Burke (1976), D'Alton (1861), O'Donovan (1856), O'Keeffe (1703), Byrne (2001).\\n\\nOther notable people are:\\n\\nFor the 20th century, the long hidden Ó Coileáins of Uí Conaill Gabhra, once the most dominant sept of the Uí Fidgenti, produced the famous Michael Collins, or Mícheál Ó Coileáin. His sept were driven out of County Limerick in the 13th century by the FitzGeralds, but still regarded themselves as dispossessed aristocracy. The Ó Coileáins had joined their cousins the O'Donovans in County Cork, who themselves had been assisted by their friends the O'Mahonys. The MacCarthy Reagh would soon follow to become the princes of the area, or Barony of Carbery, and later both they and the O'Mahonys would send septs to be accepted among the aristocracy in France. See also Counts of Toulouse. Of the four, only the O'Donovans, keeping a low profile, remained Gaelic lords after a time.\\n\\nThe MacCarthy of Muskerry dynasty are of great importance and there are several surviving septs.\\n\\nDaniel \"The Liberator\" O'Connell belonged to a small sept of the Uí Fidgenti who found themselves in County Kerry.\\n\\nAnother lively figure was Pierce Charles de Lacy O'Mahony.\\n\\nCurley  gives profiles of some twenty current Irish lords, several of them Eóganacht or allied, enjoying varying levels of recognition. \\n\\nThe scandal created by Terence Francis MacCarthy has left their futures uncertain.

The western portion of the park, formerly named Pine Mountain State Park, was named a National Historic Landmark in 1997. \\n\\nSeveral structures in the park were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the Great Depression, including a stone swimming pool and Roosevelt's favorite picnic spot at Dowdell's Knob, overlooking the valley below.

{"title": "F. K. Otto Dibelius", "body": "thumbFriedrich Karl Otto Dibelius (May 15, 1880 - January 31, 1967) was a German bishop of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg, and staunch opponent of Nazism and communism.\\n\\nHe was born in Berlin, Brandenburg, in 1880. One of his cousins was the Protestant theologist Martin Dibelius. From 1899-1903 he studied at the Frederick William University of Berlin. He received his Ph.D. in 1902. From 1904-06 he studied at the Preachers' Seminary in Wittenberg. He was then employed as minister by the Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces. From 1906-07 he was the assistant pastor at Guben. From 1907-09 he was the archdeacon at Crossen an der Oder. From 1909-10 he was the assistant pastor at the Church of SS. Peter and Paul in Danzig. From 1911-15 he was the chief pastor at Lauenburg in Pomerania. From 1915-25 he was the pastor of the Heilsbronnen congregation in Berlin-Schöneberg. In 1918 he was the executive secretary (part time) of the Mutual Trust Council in the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council (, EOK) of the Evangelical State Church in Prussia's older Provinces, which renamed after the separation of state and religion into Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union in 1922. In 1921 he was a member of the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council (part time). From 1925-33 he was the superintendent-general of the Kurmark within the old-Prussian Ecclesiastical Province of the March of Brandenburg. He then also became a member of the consistory, an administrative body, of that ecclesiastical province and joined the German National People's Party. \\n\\nA problem was the spiritual vacuum, which emerged after the church stopped being a state church. Dibelius, published his book Das Jahrhundert der Kirche (), in which he declared the 20 century to be the era when the Evangelical Church may for the first time develop freely and gain the independence God would have wished for, without the burden and constraints of the state church function. He regarded the role of the church as even more important, since the state of the Weimar Republic - in his eyes - would not provide the society with binding norms any more, thus this would be the task of the church. The church would have to stand for the defence of the Christian culture of the Occident. In this respect Dibelius regarded himself as consciously anti-Jewish, explaining in a circular to the pastors in his general superintendency district of Kurmark, \"that with all degenerating phenomena of modern civilisation Judaism plays a leading role\". His book was one of the most read on church matters in that period. \\n\\nOn 21 March 1933 the newly elected Reichstag convened in Potsdam's Evangelical Garrison Church (), an event commemorated as the Day of Potsdam, and Dibelius, then the locally competent General-Superintendent held the preach. Dibelius downplayed the boycott against enterprises of Jewish proprietors and such of Gentiles of Jewish descent in an address for the US radio. Even after this clearly anti-Semitic action he repeated in his circular to the pastors of Kurmark on the occasion of Easter (16 April 1933) his anti-Jewish attitude, giving the same words as in 1928. \\n\\nOnce the Nazi government realised that the 28 Protestant church bodies in Germany were not to be streamlined from within using the Nazi-submissive German Christians faction within the church, they abolished the constitutional freedom of religion and religious organisation. This was an act strictly opposed by Dibelius, who just saw the separation of state and church as a prerequisite of the latter's free development to its best. On June 24 the Nazi Minister of Cultural Affairs, Bernhard Rust appointed August Jäger as Prussian State Commissioner for the Prussian Ecclesiastical Affairs (). Jäger furlough - among many others - Dibelius. \\n\\nOn July 14 Adolf Hitler discretionarily decreed an unconstitutional premature re-election of all elders ( or Presbyter) and synodals in all 28 Protestant church bodies in Germany for July 23. The new synod of the 28 Protestant churches were to declare their dissolution as separate church bodies in favour of a united German Evangelical Church (). Representatives of all 28 Protestant churches were to attend the newly created National Synod to confirm the designated Ludwig Müller as Reich's Bishop. Müller already now regarded himself as leader of that new organisation. \\n\\nIn the campaign for the premature re-election of all presbyters and synodals on July 23 the Nazi Reich's government sided with the German Christians. Under the impression of the government's partiality the other existing lists of opposing candidates united to form the Evangelical Church list. The Gestapo (est. 26 April 1933) ordered the list to change its name and to replace all its election posters and flyers issued under the forbidden name. \\n\\nThe Gestapo confiscated the office and the printing-press of the Evangelical Church list, in order to hinder any reprint. Thus the list, which had been renamed as Gospel and Church (), took refuge with the Evangelical Press Association (), presided over by Dibelius and printed new election posters in its premises in Alte Jacobstraße # 129, Berlin. However, the German Christians gained 70-80% of the seats in presbyteries and synods. From 1933-34 Dibelius served the pastorate at San Remo, Italy. \\n\\nAfter his return to Germany (July 1934) and after - from May to October 1934 - the intra-church opposition, the so-called Confessing Church, had built up its own organisational structures, circumventing the officially recognised bodies of the old-Prussian church and the newly established Nazi-submissive German Evangelical Church, Dibelius served again as general superintendent in the Kurmark - ignoring his official furlough - accepted only by those congregations whose presbyteries rejected the Nazi adulterated official old-Prussian church. From 1934-45 he was a member of the March of Brandenburg provincial Councils of Brethren, the leading bodies established by the Confessing Church on all levels, such as deaneries, ecclesiastical provinces and for the overall old-Prussian church as well as in other Nazi-subjected Protestant church bodies in Germany and on the Reich's level dubbing the position of Reich's Bishop Müller by the Reich's Council of Brethren. \\n\\nBefore the end of World War II Dibelius addressed some moderate incumbents of leading positions in the official old-Prussian church, in order to establish their acceptance and co-operation in a future provisional leading body - the so-called Beirat (advisory council) of the old-Prussian church, once the Nazis would be defeated. On May 7, 1945 Dibelius organised the forming of a provisional church executive for the old-Prussian Ecclesiastical Province of the March of Brandenburg, comprising Greater Berlin and the political province of Brandenburg. The provisionally leading advisory council reconfirmed Dibelius as general superintendent of Kurmark and also commissioned him to serve per pro the vavant general superintendencies of Berlin and the New March and Lower Lusatia. The Soviet occupying power agreed that Dibelius would use the self-chosen title of Bishop, which was regarded a non-Protestant title and rejected by many, especially since the Nazi-submissive German Christians used that title for their church leaders, claiming an intra-church hierarchy in the range of the Führerprinzip.\\n\\nIn June an overall provisional church executive, the Council of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union () emerged, acting until December 1948 mostly in Central Germany, since traffic and communication between the German regions had collapsed. On 13 June 1945 the old-Prussian ecclesiastical province of Westphalia under synodal Praeses Karl Koch unilaterally assumed independence as the Evangelical Church of Westphalia. Dibelius fought this and tried to maintain the unity of the old-Prussian church. \\n\\nOn 15 July Heinrich Grüber was appointed Provost of St. Mary's and St. Nicholas' Church in Berlin and Dibelius invested him on August 8 in a ceremony in St. Mary's Church, only partially cleared of the debris. In 1945 Dibelius became a member of the newly founded Christian Democratic Union party in Germany, which later split into the western CDU and the eastern puppet party CDU(D)\\n\\nTheophil Wurm, Bishop of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg, invited representatives of all Protestant church bodies to Treysa (a part of today's Schwalmstadt) for August 31, 1945. The representatives of the six still existing old-Prussian ecclesiastical provinces (March of Brandenburg, Pomerania, Rhineland, Saxony, Silesia, and Westphalia; the other three, located in the Former eastern territories of Germany had fallen under Polish and Soviet rule, newly annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union) and the central old-Prussian Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council used the occasion to make fundamental decisions about the future of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union. The representatives decided to assume the independent existence of each ecclesiastical province and to reform the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union into a mere umbrella organisation (\"Neuordnung der Evangelischen Kirche der altpreußischen Union\"). Dibelius and some Middle German representatives (the so-called Dibelians) could not assert themselves against Koch and his partisans, to maintain the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union as an integrated church body. However, Dibelius assumed the position of president of the old-Prussian Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council. \\n\\nAs to co-operation of all the Protestant church bodies in Germany, strong resentments prevailed, especially among the Lutheran church bodies of Bavaria right of the river Rhine, the Hamburgian State, Hanover, Mecklenburg, the Free State of Saxony, and Thuringia, against any unification after the experiences during the Nazi reign with the German Evangelical Church. But it was decided to replace the pre-1933 German Federation of Protestant Churches by the new umbrella Evangelical Church in Germany, provisionally led by the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany, a naming borrowed from the brethren council organisation. Beginning in 1949, Dibelius was chairman of the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany. \\n\\nIn December 1946 Dibelius spent two weeks visiting prisoner-of-war camps in England, Scotland and Wales, a journey that had been made possible by the Control Commission for Germany and the Minister of State for War, at the request Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury. On Christmas Eve, at the invitation of Leslie Stannard Hunter, Bishop of Sheffield, he conducted a service at Sheffield Cathedral, attended by over 1,000 German prisoners of war.\\n\\nUntil 1951 all the six still existing ecclesiastical provinces of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union assumed new church constitutions declaring their independence with Dibelius' local Ecclesiastical Province of the March of Brandenburg transforming into the independent Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg. Dibelius was elected its bishop in December 1948 by the synod constituting that newly independent church body, after the function of bishop had been officially established by the new church constitution. \\n\\nIn 1947 at a meeting of delegates of the six surviving ecclesiastical provinces they confirmed the status quo, with the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union having transformed into a league of independent church bodies. The schism within the old-Prussian church was not yet fully overcome, since only the most radical German Christians had been removed or resigned from their positions. Many neutrals, forming the majority of clergy and parishioners, and many proponents of the quite doubtable compromising policy in the times of the struggle of the churches assumed positions. \\n\\nthumb It was Dibelius' policy to gain the mainstream support of parishioners. Thus the strict opposition of the Dahlemites and Barmensians, forming the uncompromised opposition of the Confessing Church during the struggle of the churches, continued to maintain their conventions in the old-Prussian brethren councils. On 14 January 1949 representatives of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union decided to reconcile the groups and founded a committee to develop a new church constitution. On 15 August 1949 the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, presided by Dibelius, issued the proposal of the committee for a new constitution, which would bring together the Westphalians striving for the complete unwinding of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union, the Dahlemites and Barmensians as well as the Dibelians. \\n\\nThe bulk of the mainstream parishioners shared a strong skepticism about, if not even objection to, communism, and so did Dibelius. So after the foundation of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the Soviet zone of occupation on 7 October 1949, including - apart from West Berlin the bulk of the territory covered by the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg -, its Bishop Dibelius was often defamed in the East as the propadandist of the western Konrad Adenauer government. After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 the GDR refused to allow Dibelius to enter its territory and East Berlin. \\n\\nOn 24 February 1950 Dibelius - heading the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council - invited for an extraordinary old-Prussian General Synod, which convened on December 11–13 in Berlin. The new constitution () transformed the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union into a mere umbrella and did away with the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, replacing it by the Church Chancery (), as administrative body. The new governing body, replacing the Church Senate led by the Praeses of the General Synod (de facto destroyed since 1933), became the Council of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union. \\n\\nThe heads of the church body, officiating a term of two years, now bore the title President of the Council (). Until the appointment of the first head in 1952 Dibelius, the former president of the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, and its other members officiated per pro as the head and members of the church chancery.\\n\\nBeginning in 1954 he was the president of the World Council of Churches (part time). He died in 1967 in Berlin (West). He was declared persona non grata by the German Democratic Republic in 1960.\\n\\n"}

The club was founded in Belgrade´s suburb Bežanija and at that time it did not fall neither under Belgrade nor Zemun football leagues. Later the club changes its name to BSK (Bežanijski sportski klub). At that time the club only managed to play friendly matches. During World War II under German occupation, Bežanija joined a Croatian NDH league and renamed HSK. In the club, despite everything, all players were Serbs.\\n\\nAfter the war in 1946 the club changes its name to FK Jedinstvo. That year the club for the first time starts competing in the Srem league and becomes a member of the Novi Sad football association.Till 1952 the club was competing in the regional Srem League.

{"title": "FK Železničar Lajkovac", "body": "FK Železničar (Serbian Cyrillic: ФK Жeлeзничap Лajкoвaц) is a football club based in Lajkovac, Serbia. \\n\\nThe club was formed in 1927 by the initiative of a group of important citizens of Lajkovac and was initially named as Sport Klub Železničar (SK Železničar). The first matches took place only in 1929 the year when the first field was made. The chairman of the club was Mr. Aleksandar Drašković who was the person who brought the first football to the town and was also in this initial period the clubs main player. Since the owner of the field didn't allowed the tree that was standing in the halfline to be cut the club had to move to a new one. But, it was soon, after this anegdotical event, that the club settled in a new definitive field in 1933, when the new club president, Dr. Eng. Miroslav Marković was already in charge. That year the club was registered in the Football Federation of Belgrade and it qualified to the league of the county of Kolubara.\\n\\nBetween 1934 and 1937 the club had some difficulties to form a squad, but it was in 1938 that the club returns to competition. The locals remember with enthusiasm the train travels they made to follow the team in their visiting matches. In the season 1938-39 three players are called to represent the team of the Kolubara county: Miladin Ilić, Jakov Vidović and Dunda Kučenović. However, the best club player of this period was Stanko Milovanović, nicknamed Pop (\"The priest\"), who played at the higher lever with several times national champions, Belgrade´s SK Jugoslavija and later for FK Partizan.\\n\\nThe Second World War marked a period when in the town other clubs were formed: Omladinac in 1943, and ŽAK in 1944. In the latter played the Yugoslav national team player Broćić. During the war, Železničar had been disbanded, but with the liberation of Yugoslavia in 1945 and by the initiative of the citizens of the town, the club was formed again and Omladinac was merged with all their players joining the club.\\n\\nBy the end of 1946 and beginning of 1947 the town lives a sports revival. The Serbian Gymnastics Federation opens its branch in the town, and there is created a section dedicated to athletics named \"Partizan\". Železničar also creates sections dedicated to chess and handball. As curiosity, many players that were Serbian handball champions in 1947 were also footballers in the club. That year, the football club begins competing from beginning, in the league of the sub-federation of Valjevo. Thanks to the Serbian Gymnastics Federation sports and physical culture gain massive impulse in the town. The school centers and the clubs are modernized and Železničar receives a new field to develop. In this period the work with youth teams gets special attention. In 1953 the club archives promotion to League of the Belgrade sub-federation. In this decade the club usually competed at this level, and the important players worth naming beside the clubs top scorer Kalman Sabov and the captain Dr. Miodrag Banković, are Milorad Ivanović and Radomir Ilić. Since the 1960s until the breakaway of Yugoslavia the club competes mostly in the league of the sub-federation of Kolubara.\\n\\nIt is perhaps in the late 1990s until 2002 that the club archives its maximum success by participating in the Second League of FR Yugoslavia. The participation of the club in national level several consecutive seasons gave to the club some prestige that was missing earlier. But by the middle 2000s the club has fallen again to further lower leagues managing to return in 2007 to the Srpska Liga West (3th national tier) a level that has been maintained for four consecutive seasons, by 2011.\\n\\n"}

They are ambushed by the Society of The Evening Star, who has taken over the preserve. Kendra and the others go to the Dreamstone, an area in the preserve, and enter into a maze where they have to make a clay warrior that turns into stone and walk across blazing hot water and having to swim all in order to use the key from Wyrmroost to find the Translocator.\\n\\nThe final task of the Dreamstone has them putting the key into a mechanical lion which is guarded by some mechanical animals. While they are doing that, the Society comes with all their zombies, Torina, The Gray Assassin, and Mirav, a wizard, to attack and try to claim the Translocator. During the attack Seth gets hit by one of Torina's arrows and turns himself into gas to save himself from dying. The Knights finally are able to get the Translocator, which was inside of the key. Trask's takes Warren, Kendra and Tanu to his apartment, using the Translocator. Unable to save the others he then takes everyone to Fablehaven. Seth gets caught by the wizard Mirav and is put in a bottle. He then finds himself in the fifth Secret preserve the Living Mirage\\n\\nUpon being released from the bottle and healed, Seth learns of the Sphinx's past. The Sphinx tells him that he came to the Preserve as a slave millennium ago and that he worked his way up, all the while 'befriending' a Demon Nagi Luna, planning to steal the Preserves artifact and open ZZyxx. He tells Seth his plans because he is sure that he will win. He says that when using the Oculus Nagi Luna is helping him get his mind away from it so that he doesn't go insane like nearly everyone else who tried using it. Also, he says that he will open the demon prison and if they do not want to come out under his control he will close it. Seth then gets put in a cell. \\n\\nThe people at Fablehaven then open up a compartment in the attic that should only be opened if the end of the world is near. Inside the compartment is a note telling them to how to use the Chronometer, to go back to talk to Patton Burgess, which they do. Patton tells them that in order for The Sphinx to open Zzyzx, he will have to kill all five of the Eternals and possess all of the Artifacts. They will have to find a way to transport them to Shoreless, located in the Bermuda Triangle,and to find a different way back though. \\n\\nSeth befriends a person named Bracken, who uses secret passageways to move about the dungeon. Bracken informs Seth that his parents are there but that he cannot get to them. Seth is unsure if he can trust Bracken, who decides to take him to someone who can vouch for him. Seth is shown Maddox, a fairy trader who was believed to be dead. Maddox tells Seth that his new friend is on the up and up. The three decide on a course of action to try and get free of the dungeon by staging a uprising. Bracken reveals to Seth that he is a unicorn, stuck as a human, based on a decision he made long ago. He makes Seth a coin so they can communicate over distance.\\n\\nWhile at Fablehaven, Grandma Sorenson wakes Kendra up and tells her Vanessa has revealed her secret. There are two masked strangers that come to the house and using the Chronometer they travel back in time with one of them, so as the Sphinx will be unable to spy on them in the past. Kendra finds out it is actually her Grandma Larsen who she thought was dead. Grandma Larsen tells her, she and her Grandpa, who is alive as well, have been spying on the Sphinx. They used stingbulbs in order for people to think they had perished in a fire. They make a plan to use the Translocator in order to steal the artifacts from Living Mirage and to save Seth. When they do the dwarf, the second masked stranger, takes the Translocator and the Sphinx captures them all except for Warren. \\n\\nSeth hears a knock at his cell door and discovers the Translocator and the Sands of Sanctity along with a note. It tells him that should use the Translocator to flee and get help. First though, Seth transports to the Sphinx's Study to try and find the other Artifacts. He is interrupted by a surprised Sphinx and flees using the Translocator. Unsure of what to do, Seth decides to fulfill his promise to Gralaus. Seth tranports to the demon's lair and uses the Sands on him. Gralaus is instantly healed and reveals himself as the evil demon he is. Overpowering Seth, he tells Seth that the Demons are working against the Sphinx and he destroys Preserve's magical boundaries and steals the Chronometer from the house. Coulter dies as a result. \\n\\nKendra is then there with the Sphinx, who tells her about his plans to open Zzyzx. Kendra is then put in Seth's old cell. She is found by Bracken, who tells her that he knows Seth. As cautious as her brother, Kendra is unsure if to trust her new ally. Bracken suddenly says he has to go, as the alarms alerting him to trespassers in his cell, go off. Following him, Kendra sees that Warren is the intruder. He tells them that as soon as the dwarf dropped him off he started on the move, which allowed him not to get caught by the Sphinx. He tells them that Gralaus has overpowered the Sphinx, who gave Warren instructions on how to get out of the preserve. He takes Kendra and Bracken out of the dungeon.\\n\\nSeth is going to the Mansion, as per Coulter dying words, when the satyrs, Doren and Newel, show up. He promises them a flat screen TV and generator if they will help him. Seth finds a message hidden behind the fireplace. It's a bottle that contains a gas figure of Patton, who gives him instructions on how to save the world. On their way back to the house, Seth encounters Centaurs, who say that with the Boundaries gone, they are claiming all of Fablehaven as their own. Seth denies their right of claim. In return, the Centaurs give Seth and his companions until the following sunset to live or else. Seth goes into the dungeon to remove Vanessa from the Quiet Box. Seth then finds three Wraiths and puts them in places around Fablehaven to guard the preserve (since Gralaus destroyed it).\\n\\nKendra, Bracken, and Warren spend most of their time avoiding the creatures of Living Mirage. They come to a pass where they can go a long less dangerous way or pass through a deadly, but short, Grove of Fruit. They decide to go through the grove of fruit, where if you eat any of it, horrendous things can happen. Bracken makes little dirt balls to put into their noses to reduce the alluring smell of the Fruit. Along the way Warren comes under the spell of the Fruit and fights Bracken to try to eat some. They make it out unharmed. Bracken is glorified by fairies, who bring them food to eat. They then come across the Guardian sphinx, who gives them three riddles they answer correctly and are able to enter the shrine of the Fairy Queen. She tells them that she will send help and tells Kendra that if she encounters any of the Astrids, to bestow a kiss upon them and they will be changed. Bracken speaks to the Fairy Queen privately.\\n\\nBack at Fablehaven, Seth captures the leprechaun Cormac, who then gives him the items (a bell, whistle and music box) Patton gave to Cormac to safeguard. Seth, Hugo, Vanessa and the satyrs go on a car trip to see the Singing Sisters, as Patton suggested, in order to find where the sword of light and dark, Vasilis, is located. Upon arrival, Seth must deal with the Guardian of the Singing Sisters first. He asks Seth why he must see them, and his reply, \"I have no other choice\", grants him an audience with them. Before departing, the Guardian gives Seth some advice on how to deal with the Sisters. Once there Seth gets three proposals from each of the Sisters, three haggard women, who's arms are linked to one another, where their hand used to be. He declines each one. Seth then makes a proposal, they would help him find the sword and he will give them in one years time Vasilis, a wraith and one thing they wanted. They agree and tell him that the sword is behind the Totem Wall. The Sisters also tell him which Totems to speak to and what to say to them to be granted access. He is given a map to the Walls location.\\n\\nRaxtus, a small dragon who is the servant of the Fairy Queen, shows up as a surprise for Kendra, and as a way to leave Living Mirage. He carries Bracken, Kendra and Warren in his claws as he flies from the Preserve. They are attacked by a Roc, whom Bracken gets to leave them alone. But before long they are attacked by harpies, one of which manages to injure Warren. Raxton kills the attackers and takes them out of Living Mirage. They decide to leave Warren with a healer he knows before continuing on their quest.\\n\\nSeth and the others travel to Canada to find the Totem Wall. He goes to where the Wall is and speaks to the Totems he's supposed to. They ask him what he hopes to achieve by acquiring the sword and how he plans to help them. Seth tells them that he wants to save the world and that he will destroy the evil that lives inside of the Wall. They allow him to enter inside and caution that evil and fear live inside and that many do not return. Inside he finds the Standing Dead. He may only pass if he passes through the room without experiencing fear or else they will come to life and claim him as one of their own. He gets scared, not because what they are, but because of the eerie thought of joining them. He uses his skills as a shadow charmer to boost his morale, and the Standing Dead let him by. At the end of the room, Seth finds a door and opens it. In the room is nearly petrified zombie, Morisant, a wizard and main creator of Zzyzx. He 'gives' the sword, Vasilis, to Seth, telling him that the sword can only be given to another if the previous owner grants permission. Even in death it can not be taken. Morisant's only request was, in return for the sword, Seth would slay Morisant and his army of the Standing Dead. Seth agrees.\\n\\nKendra and Bracken go to help one of the Eternals, Roon. They find out that he is dead. His protector tells them where the next Eternal is. His name is Mark, and is a hollow shell of a man. They go to him and he said he does not want to live any longer. He just wants to die. The Society, who has been following them, comes up and captures and kills the Eternal, Mark. They then find the next eternal. She has been on her guard for many years, able to speak more than 60 languages, and the hit squad of the Society of the Evening Star come and tries to kill her. Eventually she dies by an arrow by Torina, however Bracken then kills Torina,the Grey Assasian and Mirav. They all meet up at the place where the ship Lady Luck will take them to Shoreless Isle. They use the items to summon the Lady Luck. Seth commands the captain to take them there. They find a Fairy Shrine near Zzyxx. Kendra and Bracken speak once more to the Fairy Queen, who tells them that she has destroyed all of her other shrines, and if all else fails they have one final secret plan. The Astrids have been converging on the Shoreless Ilse and when Kendra kisses them, they turn into brilliant warriors. There she finds out Bracken is the son of the Fairy Queen.\\n\\nThe demons come out of the prison and start attacking. The Sphinx and Seth use the Translocator to go into Zzyzx, where the demons are coming out of, to try and retake the remaining artifacts. Seth fights and kills Gralaus before throwing Vasilis at Nagi Luna to destroy her, but is then affected by a poisonous bite he received in battle from from Graulas. The Astrid Peredor carries him and Vasilis to safety , where he is healed by the Sands of Sancity. They get all five artifacts.\\n\\nCreatures of Light have been spewing forth from the Fairy Realm and either engage the enemies or scatter off. The Fairy Queen and Bracken fight the Demon King, Gorgrog, a large being with antlers on his head and bodies chained to him, who seriously wounds Bracken. A spark of adrenaline makes Kendra ask for Vasilis to try and save the Fairy Queen and Bracken. The Demon King is killed by Kendra but not before the Fairy queen was able to save the Fairy King from his imprisoned place as one of the chained bodies. The demons, seeing the Fairy Shrine open and unguarded, are unable to resist the urge to turn the place of Light into Darkness and all go into the Fairy Queen's Realm, where there is only one entrance. That is to be the new Demon Prison and the Fairy Queen will make Zzyzx her realm. \\n\\nAgad becomes the caretaker of Living Mirage and helps them repair Fablehaven, repairing the Boundaries, fixing both the House and Mansion and punishing the Centaurs for trying to overthrow the Preserve. They release Kendra and Seth's Parents (who now, obviously, believe in the magical creatures). The Sphinx is made an Eternal. Bracken shows up at Fablehaven and shows Kendra the first Shrine to the Fairy Queen is at Fablehaven. He then says he likes Kendra but says they can't be together, yet. It is hinted Kendra wants to be an Eternal.\\n\\nBracken- A unicorn that is imprisoned by the Sphinx in the dungeon in the Living Mirage preserve. Bracken is trapped as a human due to him parting with his third horn, which became the Artifact known as Font of Immortality. He meets Seth and Kendra at different times in the dungeon, but he, Kendra, and Warren escape with the Sphinx's help after the demon Gralaus has taken all of the artifacts from Fablehaven. Later in the book Kendra learns that Bracken is the Fairy Queen's son.\\n\\nNagi Luna- An old demon in the dungeon at Living Mirage, she was the demon that trained the Sphinx to become a full Shadow Charmer.\\n\\nThe Gray Assasin- A member of the Society of the Evening Star that is notorious for being able to kill anyone. He has two curved swords that of which the handles are fashioned with dragon teeth.\\n\\nMirav- A wizard, formerly a dragon, that is a member of the Society of the Evening Star. He is more powerful at night.\\n\\nMorisant- One of the wizards that founded Zzyzx. He tried to cheat death by trying to make himself one of the Undead, he is the owner of Vasilis and gives the great sword to Seth, he also created the Standing Dead.\\n\\nEternals- People that are the final step at opening Zzyzx. They can only be killed by phoenix fire, a unicorn horn, dragon breath, or any other weapon of similar potency. The last three Eternals are Roon, Mark and Civia.\\n\\nAgad- a wizard who was once a dragon, but transformed into his human avatar forever to gain more magical power. He is the caretaker of one of the three most deadly dragon sanctuaries/preserves, Wyrmroost.\\n\\nFairy Queen-the \"queen\" of fairies. She is immensely powerful and is respected by all creatures of light.\\n\\nCoulter Dixon-a friend of Seth and Kendra's grandparents. He collects magical relics and is in the Knights of the Dawn.\\n\\nVannessa Santoro-a traitor to the Knights of the Dawn. She worked for the Society of the Evening Star, but she knew the Sphinx's true identity. Fearing for his safety, the Sphinx imprisoned her in the Quiet Box at Fablehaven. Because of what the Sphinx did, she switched sides.\\n\\nThe Sphinx-former leader of the Knights of the Dawn. When exposed as a traitor working for the Society of the Evening Star, he ran.\\n\\nTanugatoa (Tanu)-potion master and friend of Kendra and Seth's grandparents.

A face frame provides strength to the front of a cabinet and is also considered a visual feature of particular styles of furniture.\\n\\nFace frames are a feature of traditional cabinetry which have been replaced in many instances today by frameless cabinets which make use of edge banding to conceal the edge of the carcase. This is most commonly seen in European modular-style kitchens.\\n\\nthumbFace frames are composed of a set of intersecting frame members that are joined to one another using one of a selection of woodworking joints. The most common joints used are the butt joint or mortise and tenon. The frames consist of vertical stiles and horizontal rails. Individual compartments within the cabinet are divided by mid-stiles and mid-rails. Individual drawers are usually separated by mid-rails and mid-stiles occur between doors and wherever vertical partitions exist within the cabinet (see image Parts of a face frame).\\n\\nThe frame members are generally made from plain rectangular stock but are often visually enhanced through the application of cock beading or applied moulding. Typically a frame member will be between 25mm to 50mm in width, depending upon the application and the desired appearance of the cabinet. For built in cabinets, it is common for stiles that are to abut a wall to be cut wider than the final size so that these may be scribed to the shape of the wall. This compensates for out of plumb or uneven walls, which are common in many houses.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Facial expression", "body": "thumb\\n\\nA facial expression results from one or more motions or positions of the muscle of the face. These movements convey the emotion state of the individual to observers. Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication. They are a primary means of conveying social information among human, but also occur in most other mammals and some other animal species. Facial expressions and their significance in the perceiver can, to some extent, vary between cultures.\\n\\nHumans can adopt a facial expression to read as a voluntary action. However, because expressions are closely tied to emotion, they are more often involuntary. It can be nearly impossible to avoid expressions for certain emotions, even when it would be strongly desirable to do so; a person who is trying to avoid insult to an individual he or she finds highly unattractive might nevertheless show a brief expression of disgust before being able to reassume a neutral expression. Microexpressions are one example of this phenomenon. The close link between emotion and expression can also work in the other direction; it has been observed that voluntarily assuming an expression can actually cause the associated emotion.\\n\\nSome expressions can be accurately interpreted even between members of different species- anger and extreme contentment being the primary examples. Others, however, are difficult to interpret even in familiar individuals. For instance, disgust and fear can be tough to tell apart.\\n\\nBecause faces have only a limited range of movement, expressions rely upon fairly minuscule differences in the proportion and relative position of facial features, and reading them requires considerable sensitivity to same. Some faces are often falsely read as expressing some emotion, even when they are neutral, because their proportions naturally resemble those another face would temporarily assume when emoting.\\n\\nCharles Darwin noted in his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals:\\n\\nStill, up to the mid-20th century most anthropologists believed that facial expressions were entirely learned and could therefore differ among cultures. Studies conducted in the 1960s by Paul Ekman eventually supported Darwin's belief to a large degree.\\n\\nEkman's work on facial expressions had its starting point in the work of psychologist Silvan Tomkins.Ekman showed that contrary to the belief of some anthropologists including Margaret Mead, facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal across human cultures. \\n\\nThe South Fore people of New Guinea were chosen as subjects for one such survey. The study consisted of 189 adults and 130 children from among a very isolated population, as well as twenty three members of the culture who lived a less isolated lifestyle as a control group. Participants were told a story that described one particular emotion; they were then shown three pictures (two for children) of facial expressions and asked to match the picture which expressed the story's emotion.\\n\\nWhile the isolated South Fore people could identify emotions with the same accuracy as the non-isolated control group, problems associated with the study include the fact that both fear and surprise were constantly misidentified. The study concluded that certain facial expressions correspond to particular emotions, regardless of cultural background, and regardless of whether or not the culture has been isolated or exposed to the mainstream.\\n\\nExpressions Ekman found to be universal included those indicating anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. Findings on contempt are less clear, though there is at least some preliminary evidence that this emotion and its expression are universally recognized.\\n\\nMore recent studies in 2009 show that people from different cultures are likely to interpret facial expressions in different ways. For example, in Canada, the surprised face can be easily mixed up for the disgusted (or sometimes scared) in Kowloon, Hong Kong. \\n\\nA person's face, especially their eyes, creates the most obvious and immediate cues that lead to the formation of impressions. This article discusses eyes and facial expressions and the effect they have on interpersonal communication.\\n\\nA person's eyes reveal much about how they are feeling, or what they are thinking. Blink rate can reveal how nervous or at ease a person may be. Research by Boston College professor Joe Tecce suggests that stress levels are revealed by blink rates. He supports his data with statistics on the relation between the blink rates of presidential candidates and their success in their races. Tecce claims that the faster blinker in the presidential debates has lost every election since 1980. Though Tecce's data is interesting, it is important to recognize that non-verbal communication is multi-channeled, and focusing on only one aspect is reckless. Nervousness can also be measured by examining each candidates' perspiration, eye contact and stiffness.\\n\\nEye contact is another major aspect of facial communication. Some have hypothesized that this is due to infancy, as humans are one of the few mammals who maintain regular eye contact with their mother while nursing. Eye contact serves a variety of purposes. It regulates conversations, shows interest or involvement, and establishes a connection with others.\\n\\nBut different cultures have different rules for eye contact. Certain Asian cultures can perceive direct eye contact as a way to signal competitiveness, which in many situations may prove to be inappropriate. Others lower their eyes to signal respect, and similarly eye contact is avoided in Nigeria, and between men and women in Islam; however, in western culture this could be misinterpreted as lacking self-confidence.\\n\\nEven beyond the idea of eye contact, eyes communicate more data than a person even consciously expresses. Pupil dilation is a significant cue to a level of excitement, pleasure, or attraction. Dilated pupils indicate greater affection or attraction, while constricted pupils send a colder signal.\\n\\nThe face as a whole indicates much about human moods as well. Specific emotional states, such as happiness or sadness, are expressed through a smile or a frown, respectively. There are seven universally recognized emotions shown through facial expressions: fear, anger, surprise, contempt, disgust, happiness, and sadness. Regardless of culture, these expressions are the same. However, the same emotion from a specific facial expression may be recognized by a culture, but the same intensity of emotion may not be perceived. For example, studies have shown that Asian cultures tend to rate images of facial emotions as less intense than non-Asian cultures surveyed. This difference can be explained by display rules, which are culture-specific guidelines for behavior appropriateness. In some countries, it may be more rude to display an emotion than in another. Showing anger toward another member in a group may create problems and disharmony, but if displayed towards a competitive rival, it could create in-group cohesion.\\n\\nSome examples of feelings that can be expressed are: \\n\\nSee also: facial muscles.\\n\\n*\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Factory", "body": "250pxA factory (previously manufactory) or manufacturing plant is an industrial building where laborers manufacture goods or supervise machine processing one product into another. Most modern factories have large warehouses or warehouse-like facilities that contain heavy equipment used for assembly line production. Typically, factories gather and concentrate resources: laborers, capital and plant.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumbthumb\\n\\nAlthough large mill and workshop were established in ancient China, Rome and the Middle East, the Venice Arsenal provides one of the first examples of a factory in the modern sense of the word. Founded in 1104 in Venice, Republic of Venice, several hundred years before the Industrial Revolution, it mass-produced ships on assembly line using manufactured parts. The Venice Arsenal apparently produced nearly one ship every day and, at its height, employed 16,000 people.\\n\\nMany historians regard Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory (established in 1761 in Birmingham) as the first modern factory. (Other claims might be made for John Lombe's silk mill in Derby (1721), or Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill (1771)—purpose built to fit the equipment it held and taking the material through the various manufacturing processes.) One historian, Jack Weatherford, contends that the first factory was in Potosí, for processing silver ingot slugs into coins, because there was so much silver being mined close by. See '' City and Factory Life '' for more background concerning factory conditions.\\n\\nBritish colonies in the late 18th century built factories simply as buildings where a large number of laborers gathered to perform hand labor, usually in textile production. This proved more efficient—for administration and for the distribution of raw materials to individual laborers—than earlier methods of manufacturing such as cottage industries or the putting-out system.\\n\\nCotton mill used inventions such as the steam engine and the power loom to pioneer the industrial factory of the 19th century, where precision machine tool and replaceable parts allowed greater efficiency and less waste.\\n\\nBetween 1820 and 1850, the non-mechanized factories supplanted the traditional artisan shops as the predominant form of manufacturing institution. Even though the theory on why and how the non-mechanized factories gradually replaced the small artisan shops is still ambiguous, what is apparent is that the larger-scale factories enjoyed technological gains and advance in efficiency over the small artisan shops. In fact, the larger scale forms of factory establishments were more favorable and advantageous over the small artisan shops in terms of competition for survival.\\n\\nHenry Ford further revolutionized the factory concept in the early 20th century, with the innovation of mass production. Highly specialized laborers situated alongside a series of rolling ramps would build up a product such as (in Ford's case) an automobile. This concept dramatically decreased production costs for virtually all manufactured goods and brought about the age of consumerism.\\n\\nIn the mid- to late 20th century, industrialized countries introduced next-generation factories with two improvements:\\n\\nSome speculation as to the future of the factory includes scenarios with rapid prototyping, nanotechnology, and orbit zero-gravity facilities.\\n\\nBefore the advent of mass transportation, factories' needs for ever-greater concentrations of laborers meant that they typically grew up in an urban setting or fostered their own urbanization. Industrial slum developed, and reinforced their own development through the interaction between factories, as when one factory's output or waste-product became the raw materials of another factory (preferably nearby). Canal and railways grew as factories spread, each clustering around sources of cheap energy, available materials and/or mass markets. The exception proved the rule: even greenfield factory sites such as Bournville, founded in a rural setting, developed its own housing and profited from convenient communications systems.\\n\\nRegulation curbed some of the worst excesses of industrialization's factory-based society, a series of Factory Acts leading the way in Britain. Tram, automobiles and town planning encouraged the separate development of industrial suburbs and residential suburbs, with laborers commuting between them.\\n\\nThough factories dominated the Industrial Era, the growth in the service sector eventually began to dethrone them: the locus of labor in general shifted to central-city office towers or to semi-rural campus-style establishments, and many factories stood deserted in local rust belts.\\n\\nThe next blow to the traditional factories came from globalization. Manufacturing processes (or their logical successors, assembly plants) in the late 20th century re-focussed in many instances on Special Economic Zone in developing countries or on maquiladora just across the national boundaries of industrialized states. Further re-location to the least industrialized nations appears possible as the benefits of out-sourcing and the lessons of flexible location apply in the future.\\n\\nIn New England in the early to mid-19th century, many cotton and textile factories employed large numbers of female adolescent laborers from the New England area. The girls came from families of middling farmers. Factory employment offered an alternative to rural lifestyle, and many women labored, not only to send money back home, but to gain greater social & economic independence. They were able to earn enough at the factory to cover their living expenses and still have spending money and savings for dowries.\\n\\nIn 1834 New England textile factory owners decided to cut the wages of these young women in order to save money. In response, the young factory laborers organized turnouts (strikes) in an attempt to force their employers to raise wages again. These young women viewed themselves as equals to their managers. They saw their wage reductions as attempts to take away their economic independence and force them to become completely dependent upon factory employment for survival—to make them \"slaves\" to their employers. Because of bad timing and poor organization their 1834 factory turnout was unsuccessful, but it did lay the foundation for successful strikes that helped shape factory life in the future.\\n\\nMuch of management theory developed in response to the need to control factory processes. Assumptions on the hierarchies of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled laborers and their supervisors and managers still linger on; however an example of a more contemporary approach to handle design applicable to manufacturing facilities can be found in Socio-Technical Systems (STS).\\n\\nA shadow factory is a term given to dispersed manufacturing sites in times of war to reduce the risk of disruption due to enemy air-raid and often with the dual purpose of increasing manufacturing capacity.\\n\\nProduction of the Supermarine Spitfire at its parent company's base at Woolston, Southampton was vulnerable to enemy attack as a high profile target and was well within range of Luftwaffe bombers. Indeed on 26 September 1940 this facility was completely destroyed by an enemy bombing raid. Supermarine had already established a plant at Castle Bromwich, this action prompted them to further disperse Spitfire production around the country with many premises being requisitioned by the British Government.\\n\\nConnected to the Spitfire was production of its equally important Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, Rolls-Royce's main aero engine facility was located at Derby, the need for increased output was met by building new factories in Crewe and Glasgow and using a purpose-built factory of Ford of Britain in Trafford Park Manchester.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fahrenheit 451 Books", "body": "Fahrenheit 451 Books is a bookstore, formerly located on 509 South Coast Highway in Laguna Beach, California. It was described by the Los Angeles Times as a \"literary landmark\" of the region. It was established in 1968 by Dennis Madison. It was sold in 1972 to Gordon & Evie Wilson. In the early 1970s, the bookstore was marred in legal battles with the City of Laguna Beach, charged with selling obscene literature.\\n\\nThe bookstore’s fortunes changed for the better when, in June 1976, Fahrenheit was bought by Lorraine and Norman Zimmerman, and their friend, Mike Kopp (the Zimmermans became sole owners from Fall 1978). After extensive renovation, the new owners opened the bookstore to the public in October 1976. With about 10,000 titles confined to a 650 sq. ft. space, the grand opening ceremony took place on Nov. 14th, 1976, with famed activist, Jerry Rubin, signing copies of his new book, Growing Up at Thirty-Seven (New York : M. Evans, 1976). On December 14, 1982, Fahrenheit 451 Books opened a Used Book Annex. Present at the Anex's grand opening was none other than Ray Bradbury and his favorite illustrator, Joseph Mugnaini. Run by Carmen Blue, the Annex drew bibliophiles from the entire Orange Country region, until it closed in 1987.\\n\\nWithin five years of its grand opening, Fahrenheit 451 Books received national recognition. In a 1981 New York Times article on the effect of the economic slowdown on book sales throughout the country, Fahrenheit's owner, Lorraine Zimmerman, was one of five bookseller interviewed. By the time Lorraine Zimmerman sold the bookstore on December 18, 1988, to Dorothy Ibsen (the bookstore closed its doors shortly after), Fahrenheit 451 Books had become a celebrated cultural institution throughout the whole of southern California and beyond. In January 1987, the Los Angeles Times described Fahrenheit as “one of the most distinctive independent bookstore in Southern California next to George Sand Books in West Hollywood.”  When the store closed under Zimmerman's ownership, the same newspaper referred to Fahrenheit as \"a socially liberal literary oasis in a county famous for its ultraconservative bent.\"  Zimmerman's bookstore also received praise in a popular book on California. \"Bookstores are as rare as radicals in Orange County,\" Ray Riegert wrote in his Hidden Coast of California. \"One notable exception is Fahrenheit 451....You won't miss it, that's for sure,\" he continued. \"... [for] within its limited space is a connoisseur's collection of newspapers, magazines, hardcovers, and page turners.\"  Fahrenheit 451 Books also found its way into T. Jefferson Parker's celebrated novel, Little Saigon.\\n\\nIn the period 1976-1988, Fahrenheit made headlines by hosting book signing for some twenty internationally renowned authors. These included Lawrence Ferlingetti, Literary San Francisco: a Pictorial History from its Beginnings to the Present Day (Aug. 1980); Galloway Kinnell, There are Things I Tell to No One (Jan. 1981); Carolyn Forché, Gathering the Tribes (Sept. 1982); Ray Bradbury and Joseph Mugnaini, Fahrenheit 451: Illustrated by Joseph Mugnaini (Dec. 1982); Oakley Hall, Children of the Sun (June 1983); Gary Snyder, Axe Handles: Poems (Sept. 1983); Denise Levertov, Light Up the Cave (April 1984); Allen Ginsberg, Collected poems, 1947-1980 (Aug. 1985); T. Jefferson Parker, Laguna Heat (Oct. 1985) and Little Saigon (Sept. 1988); June Jordan, Civil Wars: Observations from the Front Lines of America (Sept. 1986); P. D. James (Jan. 1987), Robert Ray, Dial \"M\" for Murdock (March 1987), Michael Chabon, The mysteries of Pittsburgh  (May 1988), Alice McDermott, That Night (Nov. 1987), Charles Wright (1986), Robert Scheer (1988), and Richard Ford. In addition to books, music was an important part of the bookstore’s offerings. Such albums as \"Pianoscapes\" by Michael Jones, \"Autumn\" & \"December\" by George Winston, \"Passages\" by William Ackerman, and Kitarō's \"Theme from Silk Road\" were sold and often playing in the background. New Age music was a part of the 1980s music scene and had a way of beautifully enveloping the bookstore's atmosphere. Calming and serene, New Age music combined with the sea breeze and balmy ocean air to form part of the Fahrenheit 451 Books experience.\\n\\nThere is no better reflection of the impact Fahrenheit 451 Books had on this small coastal California town than in what the celebrated novelist P.D. James entered into the bookstore's scrapbook: \"Fahrenheit is my idea of a perfect bookstore.\"  The success of Fahrenheit 451 Books was largely due to the competency and commitment of its owner, who stated less than a month before passing the keys to a new owner that \"to say I own a bookstore, it's a title of respect and integrity and honesty.\"  In an article for American Bookseller, Zimmerman discussed her core philosophy of bookselling. \"Discussing books,\" she wrote, \"with customers and local writers; sponsoring literary events; having a finger on the pulse of current American thought through the knowledge of forthcoming books and my customers' requests; having the ability to disseminate hard-to-find information--these were the daily rewards of bookselling.\" \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fairey S.9/30", "body": "The Fairey S.9/30 was a two seat, single engined biplane built to an Air Ministry call for a fleet reconnaissance aircraft. It flew during 1934-6 in both land- and seaplane configurations. Although only one was built, it was the progenitor of the Fairey Swordfish.\\n\\nThe design evolution that led to the Fairey Swordfish began with Fairey's submission to Air Ministry specification S.9/30 for a two seat fleet spotter-reconnaissance aircraft. The company were awarded funds for a prototype in August 1931. The resulting aircraft, which did not fly until 22 February 1934 was known only by its specification number.\\n\\nThe Fairey S.9/30 was constructed throughout with stainless steel strip and tube, fabric covered. It was a single bay biplane with wings of slight stagger and sweep. The lower wing was a little smaller both in span and chord; because of these differences the interplane strut converged noticeably towards the lower wing and the outer pairs leaned slightly outwards. Aileron were only fitted to the upper wing, which also had leading edge slot. The wings could fold for on-ship storage.\\n\\nThe most obvious difference between the S.9/30 and its descendants was the powerplant, the former having a liquid cooled V-12 Rolls-Royce Kestrel, rather than the radial engine of the Swordfish. This engine was steam cooled, with condensers on the underside of the upper wing centre section. The upper wing was above the top of the fuselage and the pilot's open cockpit was just behind the trailing edge of the narrow chord centre section, his view enhanced by the resulting cut-outs in both wings. Immediately behind him there was a long cockpit for the gunner. The empennage was conventional, with a braced tailplane and balanced control surfaces.\\n\\nThe S.9/30 was flown from land and later as a seaplane. Its wheeled undercarriage was divided, the main legs meeting the forward spar under the centre section interplane struts and with forward bracing to the fuselage at the rear of the engine bay. The main wheels had low pressure tyres and were fitted with wheel brakes; there was a small tailwheel. As a seaplane, it had a single central float, braced by two forward struts to the rear of the engine and a pair of aft struts joining the float to the rear wing spar. This float, almost as long as the aircraft and projecting well forward of the nose, had a single step and a water rudder. A pair of stabilizing floats were mounted outboard, braced to the wings spars under the outer interplane struts.\\n\\nTests in the landplane configuration continued through 1934, when the floats were fitted. It first flew as a seaplane on 15 January 1935 at Fairey's Hamble base. It went for Naval tests at Felixstowe in 1936, where its clean behaviour on the water was praised. In the air, the controls were found to be \"heavy but positive\".\\n\\nAt the same time as they were rather slowly building the S.9/30, Fairey were also working on a very similar aircraft that would combine the spotter reconnaissance role with that of a torpedo bomber. Originally intended for the Greek Air Force, it only differed in having a 625 hp (466 kW) radial Armstrong Siddeley Panther VI engine. This aircraft became known as the TSR I and flew for the first time on 21 March 1933, well before the S.9/30. Apart from the engine, the TSR I differed from the S.9/30 only in having strut-interlinked ailerons on both wings and, initially a spatted undercarriage. In June the engine was changed to a 635 hp (474 kW) Bristol Pegasus IIM, another radial enclosed, like the previous powerpalnt in a narrow chord Townend ring. At about the same time it lost its spats and arrester hook. The sole aircraft was lost after a flat spin in September 1934.\\n\\nDespite its loss, the performance was good enough to call for the production of another aircraft to the specification S.15/33, an amalgamation of the earlier specifications S.9/30and M.1/30 for a torpedo bomber. The resulting machine was the '''TSR II'''; compared to the TSR I it was lengthened and the altered centre of gravity accommodated by increased wing sweep. It had a broader chord rudder and a wide chord cowled Pegasus engine. This was the Swordfish prototype.\\n\\nS.9/30\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fairfax County Parkway", "body": "The Fairfax County Parkway, signed as State Route 7100, is a secondary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. It provides a north–south arterial route in Fairfax County with a mix of interchange and signalized and unsignalized intersections. Its alignment roughly corresponds to part of the once-proposed Outer Beltway around Washington, D.C. The first segment of the roadway opened in 1987; the road was completed in 2010.\\n\\nThe Franconia-Springfield Parkway (State Route 7900) is a spur near the south end of SR 7100, leading east through Springfield and serving the Franconia-Springfield Metro station. While SR 7100 has access to the main lanes of I-95, SR 7900 interchanges with the HOV lane of the Shirley Highway, a reversible lane system in the median of I-95 and I-395 to Washington.\\n\\nThe Fairfax County Parkway and its branch to Franconia generally have interchange at major roads and traffic signal at less major roads. Along the main parkway (SR 7100), there are 17 full or partial interchanges and 39 signals, with eleven of those signals at interchanges; the Franconia-Springfield Parkway (SR 7900) has five interchanges and only three signals. In addition, there are many unsignalized intersections along the road, but none of these are driveway, since the road is limited-access. The road generally has a speed limit of .\\n\\nThe south end of SR 7100 begins at an intersection with US 1 at Accotink and heads northwest through Fort Belvoir, leaving the fort at a diamond interchange with Telegraph Road (SR 611), crossing 1-95 at a full cloverleaf (exit 166), crossing over Fullerton Road, passing through interchanges with Boudinot Drive and Barta Road, and turning west through West Springfield at Rolling Road. This portion replaced the existing Backlick Road (SR 617), which continues north from the I-95 interchange and connects to the Franconia-Springfield Parkway (SR 7900). During most of the parkway's life, the portion between Fullerton Road and SR 7900 had not been constructed due to delay caused by environmental issues, including an oil spill along its path through the Fort Belvoir Proving Ground. Since approval in 2008, construction began in 2009 and the new portion was opened in late 2010.\\n\\nSR 7900 begins at an intersection with Beulah Street (SR 613), with Manchester Boulevard/Kingstowne Boulevard continuing east to Van Dorn Street. The road heads west, with interchanges at the Franconia-Springfield Metrorail/VRE station, Frontier Drive, the Shirley Highway reversible HOV lane, and Backlick Road (SR 617). At the Rolling Road (SR 638) interchange, SR 7900 ends and merges with SR 7100. Rolling Road south of the interchange was rebuilt to carry SR 7100, and a large loop ramp is designed for northbound SR 7100 traffic. Beyond this interchange, SR 7100 has two diamond interchange, with Sydenstricker Road/Gambrill Road (SR 640) and Pohick Road (SR 641)/Hooes Road (SR 636), before a stretch of several miles with only at-grade intersections. From Backlick Road (SR 617) west to this SR 636 interchange, the parkway paralleled and replaced the existing Hooes Road (SR 636).thumb\\n\\nFrom Hooes and Pohick Roads (SR 636/SR 641) northwest to the interchange with Ox Road (SR 123), SR 7100 is a surface road, built directly on the former Pohick Road. The parkway beyond Ox Road was built on a new alignment, and has a much smaller number of intersections. Just past Ox Road, SR 7100 passes under Clara Barton Drive, a minor residential street. It intersects the west end of Burke Center Parkway (SR 643), crosses over the Virginia Railway Express Manassas Line and Fairfax Station Road (SR 660), and intersects several other roads before a freeway section begins at a folded diamond interchange with Braddock Road (SR 620). A complicated three-level diamond takes SR 7100 over Lee Highway (US 29) at the south end of West Ox Road (SR 608), and SR 7100 crosses I-66 at exit 55, a cloverleaf. After passing over Fair Lakes Circle (SR 7701), the freeway ends at Fair Lakes Parkway (SR 7700); the next interchange, at Lee Jackson Memorial Highway (US 50), is a partial cloverleaf with two signals on SR 7100.\\n\\nFrom US 50 to Franklin Farm Road, the parkway curves northwest to reach the Outer Beltway right-of-way. This straight path is followed until Baron Cameron Avenue (SR 606), and includes an overpass at Pinecrest Road in the Fox Mill Estates neighborhood. After crossing the Dulles Access Road (SR 267), SR 7100 follows the east border of Herndon, with interchanges at Sunset Hills Road (SR 675) and Baron Cameron Avenue (SR 606). The parkway leaves the straight Outer Beltway alignment just beyond Baron Cameron Avenue, curving northwest and north to end at a diamond interchange with Leesburg Pike (SR 7), at which the traffic signals are on SR 7100. Algonkian Parkway continues north as a four-lane local road, eventually curving back west and south to SR 7 just east of SR 28.thumb\\n\\nSR 7100 is also known as the John F. (Jack) Herrity Parkway, designated by the Virginia General Assembly in 1995, and the Trooper Charles Mark Cosslett Memorial Highway, designated in 2010 as the final link through Fort Belvoir. In 2001 SR 7900 was named the Joseph V. Gartlan, Jr., Parkway. Jack Herrity served for 12 years on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, and was instrumental in getting the road built; Joseph V. Gartlan, Jr. was a state senator who served Fairfax County for 28 years. These names are ceremonial, and are rarely used by the public.\\n\\nThe Fairfax County Parkway Trail is a multi-use trail that runs alongside the Franconia-Springfield Parkway and Fairfax County Parkway from Beulah Road to SR 7, mostly as a sidepath, but sometimes using adjacent frontage road and old alignments of the roads that the parkway replaced. It intersects the Washington and Old Dominion Trail north of Sunset Hills Road at Herndon, near that trail's mile 19.\\n\\nThe Outer Beltway was first planned in 1950 as the \"Cross Country Loop\", part of the National Capital Planning Commission's comprehensive plan. In Virginia, by the time of a 1965 plan, it was to run through southern and western Fairfax County, crossing the Potomac River at Mason Neck and north of Great Falls, and passing generally west of State Route 123 (Ox Road) and east of SR 645 (Clifton Road, Stringfellow Road, and Lees Corner Road). The straight part of the Fairfax County Parkway between south of Franklin Farm Road and north of Baron Cameron Road is built where the beltway would have been. During the 1970s, attention was focused on the Metrorail system, and environmental concern temporarily pushed the Outer Beltway onto the back burner. In the 1980s and 1990s, when the plan was revived as the Western Transportation Corridor, the route was shifted further west.\\n\\nThe idea for the Springfield Bypass started in the 1970s as a bypass of SR 644 (Old Keene Mill Road) in Springfield. It was soon expanded, by 1978, to include most of what had been planned as the Outer Beltway. The Commonwealth Transportation Board approved final plans on July 16, 1987 for the  road, with 16 interchanges and 35 traffic signals between U.S. Route 1 at Fort Belvoir and State Route 7 near Dranesville. A spur to Franconia was included, providing access to the Shirley Highway HOV lane and the Franconia-Springfield Metrorail station. Except for a short six-lane piece in Reston, the $242 million plan included only four lanes. Since it was a surface road, the highway could incorporate existing roads. This included portions of SR 617 (Backlick Road), SR 636 (Hooes Road), SR 641 (Pohick Road), and SR 680 (Stuart Road).\\n\\n55 homes and five businesses had to be taken by eminent domain to build the road. Included in these 55 homes were five at the brand-new Innisfree subdivision in Springfield. Only months after families moved into the houses, located between SR 636 (Hooes Road) and the proposed highway, they were informed that their land would be needed for the interchange at SR 640 (Sydenstricker Road). Originally planned as an at-grade intersection, projections of increased traffic led to a redesign that required more right-of-way.\\n\\nThe Fairfax County Board of Supervisors changed the name to the Fairfax County Parkway on June 23, 1988, noting that it traveled far from Springfield. The Franconia Spur was not renamed to the suggested Springfield Parkway at that time, to give time to find a single name for the entire spur, already known as Kingstowne Boulevard at its east end. By the next year, the permanent Franconia-Springfield Parkway name had been applied to the portion west of State Route 613 (Beulah Street); the rest of the road was not built as part of the project, and now carries the Manchester Boulevard and Kingstowne Boulevard names.\\n\\nThree bond issue were approved by Fairfax County voters to pay for construction of the highway, as well as other roads in the county: $135 million in November 1985, $150 million in April 1988, and $130 million in November 1992. The first portions of the road to open were financed by developer building in the area: the Cavalier Land Development Corporation from a new interchange on Interstate 66 north to U.S. Route 50, and the Hazel/Peterson Companies from Stringfellow Road north to Franklin Farm Road, both completed in 1987. On October 24, 1989, the gap from US 50 to Stringfellow Road was filled, and the road was extended from Franklin Farm Road north to West Ox Road (SR 608). It was further extended north to a new interchange on the Dulles Toll Road (SR 267) on October 22, 1991, and north to Sunset Hills Road (SR 675) on July 7, 1993.\\n\\nThe first piece of the Franconia-Springfield Parkway, a short bypass of Hooes Road (SR 636) from Rolling Road (SR 638) east over Accotink Creek to near Lackawanna Drive, opened on August 7, 1989. The rest of this spur to Beulah Street (SR 613) in Franconia opened on June 8, 1992, along with the reversible HOV ramps to the Shirley Highway (I-95/I-395). (The Franconia-Springfield station did not open for Virginia Railway Express and Metrorail trains until four and five years later, respectively; the interchange at Frontier Drive serving the station opened in December 1995.)\\n\\nThe next pieces of the road to open were in the southwest, with an upgrade and bypass of Hooes Road (SR 636) from Pohick Road (SR 641) east to Rolling Road (SR 638) and the Franconia-Springfield Parkway opening by November 1993. The highway from Ox Road (SR 123) north to Braddock Road (SR 620) opened on July 28, 1995, and was connected to the existing portion at I-66 on September 19. Two interchanges along this portion and the older one to the north - at US 50 and at US 29 - opened on December 14 and December 20 respectively. From SR 123 southeast to the beginning of the Franconia-Springfield Parkway, existing two-lane roads were widened, opening the road from SR 123 east to Lee Chapel Road (SR 643) by May 1996 and to Pohick Road (SR 641) on July 2, 1996, completing the road from Springfield to Herndon. However, until a new bridge opened in early September 2002, traffic on Pohick Road northbound (just east of Hooes Road) was required to turn right onto the parkway.\\n\\nThe southernmost portion, from US 1 north across I-95 to Fullerton Road, mostly an upgrade of Backlick Road (SR 617), opened south of Telegraph Road (SR 611) by July 1997 and north of Telegraph Road later that year. The first part north of Sunset Hills Road (SR 675), a short piece from the new interchange with SR 7 south to Sugarland Road (SR 604), opened by June 1999. Extensions opened south to Wiehle Avenue (SR 828) on November 1, 2000 and Baron Cameron Avenue (SR 606) on December 21, 2000. The gap was filled on November 5, 2001, finally completing the parkway north of Springfield.\\n\\nConstruction has been delayed many times on the last segment, between Fullerton Road (just north of I-95) and Rolling Road (SR 638), which will allow traffic on the main part of the parkway to connect directly to the I-95 main lanes. Plans were made here in the late 1980s, and it was to be paid for by a developer who was to build a development on land bought from the U.S. Army's Fort Belvoir. But those plans fell through, and traffic growth necessitated a redesign. Plans were again postponed in the early 2000s due to necessary environmental cleanup of that part of Fort Belvoir, which included unexploded ordnance. The Environmental Protection Agency discovered in 2005 that an oil spill on the property had not been properly cleaned. , the project had been designed as a full freeway but was placed on hold. As of September 2010, this portion of the parkway opened for traffic, closing the gap that once existed. Until Phase III of this extension is completed, drivers on southbound SR 7100 must exit at Rolling Road to stay on the parkway southbound and likewise for northbound traffic. Phase III will reconstruct the Rolling Road interchange, turning the Fairfax County Parkway south (along Rolling Rd.), and the Franconia-Springfield Parkway will become a spur. \\n\\nPlans have been made for an interchange at Fair Lakes Parkway, just north of I-66. This project will be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds. This project was certified on August 10, 2009, and the construction contract is expected to be let August 2010. Furthermore, improvements are being made to the West Ox Road and Sunrise Valley Drive intersections with the parkway along with interchanges with the new portion of the parkway between Fullerton Road and Rolling Road at Boudinot Drive. Additions and improvements to the I-95 interchange with Fairfax County Parkway are currently under development as well. \\n\\nOnly signalized intersections and interchange are listed.\\n\\nA7100\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Faith branding", "body": "Faith branding is the concept of brand religious organizations, leaders, or media programming, in the hope of penetrating a media-driven, consumer-oriented culture more effectively. Essentially, faith branding treats faith as a product and attempts to apply the principles of marketing in order to \"sell\" the product. Faith branding is a response to the challenge that religious organizations and leaders face today regarding how to express their faith in a media-dominated culture.\\n\\nThe idea of branding has been around since the 1400s, back then the most prominent book that was being sold was in fact the (Bible Einstein 67). The advertising strategy was to be up front and frank about what it was that the individual was trying to sell. For instance they would say what the produce was, that people could buy that product right that moment, and how much it cost, these series of statements became known as direct sale messages (Einstein 67). As centuries past by the direct sale messages were used up until the industrial revolution of the 1800s and the marketing chain began to expand and change to adapt to the revolution. Companies and manufactures began to change the way that they advertised their products to the consumers, they now talk about the physical features and how the product will benefit the consumer as they said that it would “make things simpler” (Einstein 67). In today’s media driven society these same procedures have lived and are becoming more apparent with each and every new product that is released to the public.\\n\\nThis process has been refined to meet several different applications from religious groups to non-profit organizations that need help to become publicized and gain a voice of who they are and what their goals are. By utilizing commercial and advertising organizations to help promote the “product” (for example their Faith) they can make themselves known to the local area and even to the world. Due to the big media biz of the twenty first century, many people are not aware of how often the process of Faith Branding is used and how it affects them day to day.\\n\\nMara Einstein, the author of Brands of Faith and Phil Cooke, the author of Branding Faith both describe the ways that faith branding is used throughout the world and how successful this type of marketing can be when you do the steps correctly and follow the plan. These two authors teach the subject of how faith branding can be used to break through the media that dominates most of the world’s lives and how it can be exploited.\\n\\nSince society is so caught up in media today many have become distracted from other important issues. Another example of mass media taking over the lives of everyday people including Christians who according to the standards set by their worldview chooses to place priorities out of religious order, and even non-believers who choose to live by the standards that are set forth by the media and accept that as their life style. Take the major companies that dominate the shopping industry and look closely at their marketing techniques they use to advertise their products. During a religious holiday is when they are at their worst, in this case look at the Christian holiday known as Christmas. Ever since the man in a big red suit and a white beard started appearing in story time, Companies have taken this time to pull all of the stops out to sell their products in large scale by telling every individual that they deserve bigger and better things. This is not what Faith branding is used for at all.\\n\\nFaith Branding doesn’t always work the way that we intend it to work and it does oppose some opinions to the way that it should work. Branding in general does throw up some red flags especially when the topic of branding is about faith or even culture. Most people believe that the procedure of making something more apparent in the media would be solely for the corporations that produce and sell consumer goods that would be purchased and used by an individual, and the subject would develop a “bad reputation” (Cooke 160). In Cooke’s book he states that there are three dangerous areas that need to be revealed when it comes to the process of faith branding, they are “technology, chasing relevance, and conflict with the concept of marketing” (Cooke 160). Cooke discovered these issues so that when organizations are faith branding then they know what they should be cautious when they use the techniques for breaking through the ever evolving media age of the twenty first century.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fall River, Massachusetts", "body": "Fall River is a city in Bristol County, Massachusetts, in the United States. It is located about  south of Boston,  southeast of Providence, Rhode Island, and  west of New Bedford and  south of Taunton. The city's population was 91,938 during the 2000 census, making it the eighth largest city in the state. The 2008 population is listed as 90,931, a population decrease of 1.1% from 2000. The current mayor of the city is Will Flanagan, elected in 2009.\\n\\nLocated along the eastern shore of Mount Hope Bay at the mouth of the Taunton River, the City became famous during the 19th century as the leading textile manufacturing center in the United States. While the textile industry has long since moved on, its impact on the City's culture and landscape remains to this day.\\n\\nFall River's official motto is \"We'll Try\", dating back to the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1843. It is nicknamed \"The Scholarship City\", because Dr. Irving Fradkin founded Dollars for Scholars here in 1958. \\n\\nFall River is well-known for Lizzie Borden, who was accused, and later acquitted, of the 1892 double axe-murder of her father and stepmother that occurred at her home on Second Street in the city. Fall River is also known for Battleship Cove, the world's largest collection of World War II naval vessels. It is also the only city in the United States to have its city hall located over an interstate highway.\\n\\nAt the time of the establishment of the Plymouth Colony in 1620, the area what would one day become the City of Fall River was inhabited by the Pokanoket Wampanoag tribe, headquartered at Mount Hope in what is now Bristol, Rhode Island. The \"falling\" river that the name Fall River refers to is the Quequechan River (pronounced \"quick-a-shan\" by locals) which flows through the city, dropping steeply into the bay. Quequechan is a Wampanoag word believed to mean \"Falling River\" or \"Leaping/Falling Waters.\" During the 1960s, Interstate 195 was constructed through the city along length of the Quequechan River. The portion west of Plymouth Avenue was routed underground through a series of box culverts, while much of the eastern section \"mill pond\" was filled in for the highway embankment.\\n\\nIn 1653, Freetown was settled at Assonet Bay by members of the Plymouth Colony, as part of Freeman's Purchase, which included the northern part of what is now Fall River. In 1683 Freetown was incorporated as a town within the colony. The southern part of what is now Fall River was incorporated as the town of Tiverton as part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1694, a few years after the merger with Plymouth Colony. In 1746, in the settlement of a colonial boundary dispute between Rhode Island and Massachusetts, Tiverton was annexed to Rhode Island, along with Little Compton and what is now Newport County, Rhode Island. The boundary was then placed approximately at what is now Columbia Street.\\n\\nIn 1703, Benjamin Church, a hero of King Phillip's War established a saw mill, grist mill and a fulling mill on the Quequechan River. In 1714, Church sold his land, along with the water rights to Richard Borden of Tiverton and his brother Joseph. This transaction would prove to be extremely valuable 100 years later, helping to establish the Borden family as the leaders in the development of Fall River's textile industry.\\n\\nDuring the 18th century the area consisted mostly of small farms and relatively few inhabitants. In 1778, the Battle of Freetown, was fought here during the American Revolutionary War, the townspeople put up a strong defense against a British force.\\n\\nIn 1803, Fall River was separated from Freetown and officially incorporated as its own town. A year later, Fall River changed its name to \"Troy.\" The name \"Troy\" was used for 30 years and was officially changed back to Fall River on February 12, 1834.\\n\\nIn July 1843, the first great fire in Fall River's history destroyed much of the town center, including the Atheneum, which housed the Skeleton in Armor which had been discovered in a sand bank in 1832 near what is now the corner of Hartwell and Fifth Street.\\n\\nDuring this time, the southern part of what is now Fall River (south of Columbia Street) would remain part of Tiverton, Rhode Island. In 1856, the town of Tiverton, Rhode Island voted to split off its industrial northern section as Fall River, Rhode Island. In 1861, after decades of dispute, the United States Supreme Court moved the state boundary to what is now State Avenue, thereby creating a City of Fall River entirely within Massachusetts. (Also as part of this decision, Pawtucket, Massachusetts would become part of Pawtucket, Rhode Island.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe early establishment of the textile industry in Fall River grew out of the developments made in nearby Rhode Island beginning with Samuel Slater at Pawtucket in 1793. In 1811, Col. Joseph Durfee, the Revolutionary War veteran and hero of the Battle of Freetown in 1778 built the Globe Manufactory (a spinning mill) at the outlet of Cook Pond on Dwelly St. near what is now Globe Four Corners in the city's South End. (It was part of Tiverton, Rhode Island at the time.) While Durfee's mill was never very successful, it marked the beginning of the city's rise in the textile business.\\n\\nThe real development of Fall River's industry, however, would occur along the falling river from which it was named, about a mile north of Durfee's first mill. The Quequechan River, with its eight falls, combined to make Fall River the best tidewater privilege in southern New England. It was perfect for industrialization big enough for profit and expansion, yet small enough to be developed by local capital without interference from Boston.\\n\\nThe Fall River Manufactory was established by David Anthony and others in 1813. That same year, the Troy Cotton & Woolen Manufactory was built at the top end of the falls by a group led by Oliver Chace, from Swansea, who had worked as a carpenter for Samuel Slater in his early years.\\n\\nIn 1821, Colonel Richard Borden established the Fall River Iron Works, along with Maj. Bradford Durfee at the lower part of the Quequechan River. Durfee was a shipwright, and Borden was the owner of a grist mill. After an uncertain start, in which some early investors pulled out, the Fall River Iron Works was incorporated in 1825. The Iron Works began producing nails, bar stock, and other items such as bands for casks in the nearby New Bedford whaling industry. They soon gained a reputation for producing nails of high quality, and business flourished. In 1827, Col. Borden began regular steamship service to Providence, Rhode Island.\\n\\nThe American Print Works was established in 1835 by Holder Borden, uncle of Colonel Richard. With the leadership of the Borden family, the American Print Works (later known as the American Printing Company) became the largest and most important textile company in the City, employing thousands at its peak in the early 20th century. Richard Borden also constructed the Metacomet Mill in 1847, which today is the oldest remaining textile (cloth-producing) mill in the city, located on Anawan Street.\\n\\nBy 1845, the Quequechan's power had been all but maximized. The Massasoit Steam Mill was established in 1846, above the dam near the end of Pleasant Street. However, it would be another decade or so when improvements in the steam engine by George Corliss would enable the construction of the first large steam-powered mill in the city, the Union Mills in 1859.\\n\\nThe advantage of being able to import bales of cotton and coal to fuel the steam engines to Fall River's deep water harbor, and ship out the finished goods also by water, made Fall River the choice of a series of cotton mill magnates. The first railroad line serving Fall River, The Fall River Branch Railroad, was incorporated in 1844 and opened in 1845. Two years later, in 1847, the first regular steamboat service to New York City began. The Fall River Line as it came to be known operated until 1937, and for many years, was the preferred way to travel between Boston and Manhattan. The Old Colony Railroad and Fall River Railroad merged in 1854, forming the Old Colony and Fall River Railroad.\\n\\nIn 1854, Fall River was officially incorporated as a city, and had a population of about 12,000. Its first mayor was James Buffington.\\n\\nFall River profited well from the American Civil War and was in a fine position to take advantage of the prosperity that followed. By 1868, it had surpassed Lowell as the leading textile city in America with over 500,000 spindles.\\n\\nthumbThen, during 1871 and 1872, a \"most dramatic expansion\" of the city occurred: 15 new corporations were founded, building 22 new mills throughout the city, while some of the older mills expanded. The city's population increased by an astounding 20,000 people during these two years, while overall mill capacity double to more than 1,000,000 spindles. (One can only imagine the level of excitement and chaos that would have existed in the city at that time).\\n\\nBy 1876, the city had 1/6th of all New England cotton capacity and one-half of all print cloth production. \"King Cotton\" had definitely arrived. The \"Spindle City\" as it became known, was second in the world to only Manchester, England.\\n\\nTo house the thousands of new workers, mostly Irish and French Canadian immigrants during these years, over 12,000 units of company housing were built. Unlike the well-spaced boardinghouses of early Lowell or the tidy cottages of Rhode Island, worker housing in Fall River consisted of thousands of wood-framed multi-family tenements, usually three-floor \"triple-decker\" with up to six apartments. Many more privately owned tenements supplemented the company housing.\\n\\nDuring the 19th century, Fall River became famous for the granite rock on which much of the city is built. Several granite quarries operated during this time, the largest of which was the Beattie Granite Quarry, near what is now North Quarry Street, near the corner of Locust. Many of the mills in the city were built from this native stone, and it was highly regarded as a building material for many public buildings and private homes alike. The Chateau-sur-Mer mansion in Newport, Rhode Island is perhaps the best example of Fall River granite being used for private home construction.\\n\\nWhile most of the mills \"above the hill\" were constructed from native Fall River granite, nearly all of their counterparts along the Taunton River and Mount Hope Bay were made of red brick. This was due to the high costs and impracticality associated with transporting the rock through the city and down the hill, where there were no rail lines because of the steep grades. (One notable exception is the Sagamore Mills on North Main Street, which were constructed from similar rock quarried in Freetown and brought to the site by rail.)\\n\\nOn August 4, 1892, Fall River was the scene of two murder allegedly committed by Lizzie Borden. These grisly murders are remembered in a children's rhyme originally for jumping rope, according to the Fall River Historical Society. \"Lizzie Borden took an axe and gave her mother forty whacks, when she saw what she had done she gave her father forty-one.\" Borden was ultimately acquitted of the murders. Lizzie Borden is one of the most famous Fall River natives, because of the allegation.\\n\\nFall River rode the wave of economic prosperity well into the early 20th century. During this time, the city boasted several fancy hotels, theaters, and a bustling downtown. As the city continually expanded during the late 19th century, its leaders built several fine parks, schools, streetcar lines, a public water supply, and sewerage system to meet the needs of its growing population.\\n\\nIn 1920 the population of Fall River peaked at 120,485.\\n\\nthumbThe cotton mills of Fall River had built their business largely on one product: print cloth. About 1910, the city's largest employer, the American Printing Company (APC), employed 6,000 people and was the largest company printer of cloth in the world. Dozens of other city mills solely produced cloth to be printed at the APC. The city's industry had all its eggs in one, very large basket.\\n\\nWorld War I had provided a general increase in demand for textiles, and many of the mills of New England benefited during this time. The post-war economy quickly slowed, however, and production quickly outpaced demand. The Northern mills faced serious competition from their Southern counterparts due to factors such as lower labor and transportation costs, as well as the South's large investment in new machinery and other equipment. In 1923, Fall River faced the first wave of mill closures. Some mills merged and were able to limp along until the late 1920s. By the 1930s and the Great Depression, many more mills were out of business and the City was bankrupt. A few somehow managed to survive through World War II and into the 1950s.\\n\\nThe worst fire in Fall River's history occurred on the evening of February 2, 1928. It began when workers were dismantling the recently vacated Pocasset Mill. During the night the fire spread quickly and wiped out a large portion of downtown. City Hall was spared but was badly damaged. Today, many of the structures near the corner of North Main and Bedford Street date from the early 1930s, as they were rebuilt soon after the fire.\\n\\nThe once mighty American Printing Company finally closed for good in 1934. In 1937, their huge plant waterfront on Water Street was acquired by the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company and soon employed 2,600 people. In October, 1941, just a few weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor, a huge fire broke out in the old 1860's main building of the print works. The fire was a major setback to the U.S. war effort, as $15 million in raw rubber (30,000 lbs.) was lost in the inferno.\\n\\nWith the demise of the textile industry, many of the city's mills were occupied by smaller companies, some in the garment industry, traditionally based in the New York City area but attracted to New England by the lure of cheap factory space and an eager workforce in need of jobs. The garment industry survived in the city well into the 1990s but has also largely become a victim of globalization and foreign competition.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIn the 1960s the city's landscape was drastically transformed with the construction of the Braga Bridge and Interstate 195, which cut directly through the heart of the city. In the wake of the highway building boom, the city lost some great pieces of its history. The Quequechan River was filled in and re-routed for much of its length. The historic falls, which had given the city its name, were diverted into underground culverts. A series of elevated steel viaducts was constructed as to access the new Braga Bridge. Many historic buildings were demolished, including the Old City Hall, the 150-year-old Troy Mills, the Second Granite Block (built after the 1928 fire), as well as other 19th century brick-and-mortar buildings near Old City Hall.\\n\\nConstructed directly over Interstate 195, where its predecessor was, the new city hall was opened in 1976, after years of construction delays and quality control problems. Built in the Brutalist style popular in the 1960s and 1970s, the new city hall drew complaints from city workers and residents almost immediately.\\n\\nAlso during the 1970s, several modern apartment high-rise towers were built throughout the city, many part of the Fall River Housing Authority. There were two built near Milliken Boulevard, two on Pleasant Street in Flint Village, another on South Main Street, and in the north end off Robeson Street. Today, these high-rises mostly house the elderly.\\n\\nIn 1978, the city opened the new B.M.C. Durfee High School in the north end, replacing the historic Rock Street masterpiece that had become overcrowded and outdated for use as a high school. The \"new\" Durfee is one of the largest high schools in Massachusetts.\\n\\nSince about 1980, there has been a considerable amount of new development in the North end of the city, with many new single- and multi-family housing developments, particularly along North Main Street.\\n\\nIn 2002, Fall River was controversially tapped as the location for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) tank. Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of Hess Corporation, proposed building this facility in a densely populated neighborhood (approximately 10,000 people live within a one-mile (1.6 km) radius of the proposed site). Major concerns of residents were that no facility of this sort had been built in an inner city before and that LNG has a mixed safety track record.\\n\\nIn spite of the protests, the plan was recently approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Local citizens and politicians, notably Richard Clarke, the former \"terror czar\" advisor to former president George H. W. Bush, have attempted to derail the project since FERC's approval.\\n\\nThe Coast Guard, through its Southcoast Commander, Captain Ray Nash, determined in October 2007 that the LNG facility proposed for Weaver's Cove not be constructed, citing problems with navigating large tankers through and around the Brightman Street Bridge.As of 2010, Hess continues to push for the project  over the objections of groups including Save the Bay. The Project has \"dropped off the radar\" in the media, with stories running less frequently about the project.\\n\\nFall River is located at  (41.698102, -71.146994).\\n\\nthumbAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which,  of it is land and  of it (18.84%) is water.\\n\\nThe city lies on the eastern border of Mount Hope Bay, which begins at the mouth of the Taunton River starting south from the Charles M. Braga, Jr. Bridge. The greater portion of the city is built on hillsides rising quite abruptly from the water's edge to a height of more than 150 feet (46 m). From the summits of these hills the country extends back in a comparatively level table-land, on which a large section of the city now stands.\\n\\nTwo miles (3 km) eastward from the shore lies a chain of deep and narrow ponds, eight miles (13 km) long (13 km), with an average width of three-quarters of a mile, and covering an area of 3,500 acres (14 km²). These ponds are supplied by springs and brooks, draining a water-shed of 20,000 acres (80 km²). The northern pond is the North Watuppa Pond, the city's main reservoir. The southern pond is the South Watuppa Pond. Where the two ponds meet is called the \"The Narrows.\" East of the North Watuppa Pond is the Watuppa Reservation that includes several thousand acres of forest-land for water supply protection that extends north into the Freetown-Fall River State Forest, and east to Copicut Reservoir. Copicut Pond is located on the border of Dartmouth in North Dartmouth's Hixville section that borders Fall River. The Quequechan River breaks out of its bed in the west part of the South Watuppa Pond, just west of The Narrows, and flows through the city (partially underground in conduits) where it falls to a channel leading to what is now Heritage State Park at Battleship Cove on the Taunton River. The Quequechan River originally flowed unconfined over an almost level course for more than a mile. In the last half-mile (800 m) of its progress it rushes down the hillside in a narrow, precipitous, rocky channel, creating the falls for which Fall River is named. In this distance the total fall is about . and the volume of water  per second.thumbOriginally an attractive feature of the landscape, the Quequechan has seldom been visible since it was covered over by cotton mills and the Bay Colony Railroad line in the 19th century. As the Quequechan become an underground feature of the industrial landscape, it also became a sewer. In the 20th century the mills were abandoned and some of them burned, exposing the falls once more. Because of highway construction in the 1960s, the waterfalls were buried under Interstate 195, which crosses the Taunton River at Battleship Cove.\\n\\nPlans exist to \"daylight\" the falls, restore or re-create them, and build a green belt with a bicycle path along the Quequechan River. In the south end, Cook Pond, also formerly known as Laurel Lake, is located east of the Taunton River and west of the South Watuppa Pond. Between the area of modern day Cook and South Watuppa Ponds, east of the Taunton River and north of Tiverton, Rhode Island, was once referred to as \"Pocasset Swamp\" during King Philip's War in 1675–1676.\\n\\n(Unofficial list)\\n\\nthumbAccording to the United States Census of 2000, the population of Fall River is 91,938. The largest racial groups within the city were 91.2% (83,815) White, 2.5% (2,283) African American, 2.2% (1,987) Asian and 0.2% (172) Native American. 47% (43,253) of the population described themselves as being of Portuguese ancestry. The next largest groups by ancestry are French 13.4% (12,343), Irish 9.8% (9,029), English 6.6% (6,085), French Canadian 5.9% (5,458), Italian 3.6% (3,293) and Polish 3.4% (3,148).\\n\\nFall River and surrounding communities form a part of the Providence metropolitan area, which has an estimated population of 1,622,520.\\n\\nIn percentage terms Fall River has the largest Portuguese American population in the United States. However, the exact percentage of the population they make up is disputed. A 2005 study by the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth has given it at 49.6%  while other sources give it as 43.9%.\\n\\nThe city has 38,759 households and 23,558 families. The population density was 2,963.7 per square mile (1,144.3/km²). There were 41,857 housing units at an average density of 1,349.3/sq mi (521.0/km²). Of the 38,759 households 29.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.3% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.2% were non-families. 34.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.32 and the average family size was 3.00.\\n\\nIn terms of age the population was spread out with 24.1% under the age of 18, 9.2% from 18 to 24, 29.8% from 25 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 16.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 87.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.9 males.\\n\\nThe median household income was $29,014, and the median family income was $37,671. Males had a median income of $31,330 versus $22,883 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,118. About 14.0% of families and 17.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 25.4% of those under age 18 and 17.4% of those age 65 or over.\\n\\nthumbthumbFall River retains a vibrant mix of cultures from around the globe. While the distinct ethnic neighborhoods formed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries have changed over the years, the legacy of immigrants who came to work in the mills can be found in the various parishes and restaurants throughout the city.\\n\\nThe city is host to many ethnic festivals throughout the year. The largest, the Great Holy Ghost Festival, occurs each August at Kennedy Park and attracts over 200,000 visitors, everywhere from Canada, to Portugal. The feast is held over a total of four days.\\n\\nEach summer, the city uses its waterfront at Heritage State Park and Battleship Cove for a Fourth of July fireworks display. For many years the waterfront also hosted the annual Fall River Celebrates America Festival, sponsored by the Fall River Chamber of Commerce. The event was suspended in 2010, due to lack of financial support. However, the Chamber hopes to have the event again in 2011, to mark its 100th anniversary.\\n\\nIn recent years, different groups have made an effort to increase awareness in the arts in the city, using vacant mill space for studios and performance centers, such as the Narrows Center for the Arts on Anawan Street. A proposal is in place to revitalize the downtown area by the creation of an Arts District. Along with the art centers being established throughout the city, Fall River is also known throughout New England as a \"City of Bands\". Fall River has numerous Portuguese/Community Bands throughout the city that perform throughout the year.\\n\\nFall River remains a predominantly Roman Catholic city and is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River, located at St. Mary's Cathedral on Second Street, formed in the 1850s by Irish immigrants. Another very imposing Catholic church is St. Anne's Church. Dozens of other Catholic parishes existed throughout the city, with each ethnic enclave having its own parish. In recent years, the diocese has merged several parishes in the city, closing some, and renaming the united congregations.\\n\\nHistorically, the Highlands neighborhood was predominantly Protestant, with several churches in the area of North Main and Rock Streets. Various other ethno-religious groups also live in the city, including a historic Jewish synagogue on High Street and many newer congregations throughout the city. Recent arrivals from Cambodia also maintain Buddhist temples in the city.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumbThe city is led by the mayor-council form of government, and the current mayor is Will Flanagan.\\n\\nThe city's police department is consolidated into a large central police station. There are six fire stations located around the city. The Fire Headquarters is located on Commerce Drive, just across from the former Fall River Municipal Airport. There are four post offices in the city, located in Flint Village, the South End Branch (near Globe Corners), Highland Station and the central branch just behind Government Center, a post office modeled after the New York City main post office behind Penn Plaza. The city is also home to a Superior Court, a District Court and the new Bristol County Court House, located in the former B.M.C. Durfee High School building on Rock Street. A new District Court is on South Main Street.\\n\\nFall River is represented by three separate Massachusetts House of Representatives districts (one of which represents the majority of the city) and is represented by David B. Sullivan (6th Bristol), Kevin Aguiar (7th Bristol), and Michael J. Rodrigues (8th Bristol). The city is represented by Senator Joan M. Menard (D-Fall River) who serves as the Assistant Majority Leader of the State Senate, in the First Bristol and Plymouth district, which includes the city and the towns of Freetown, Lakeville, Rochester, Somerset and Swansea.\\n\\nFall River is patrolled by the Third Barracks of Troop D of the Massachusetts State Police, based out of Dartmouth.\\n\\nOn the national level, the city is divided between Massachusetts Congressional Districts 3 and 4, which are represented by Jim McGovern and Barney Frank, respectively. The state's senior (Class II) Senator is John Kerry, Scott Brown is the junior Senator from Massachusetts.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumb\\n\\nThanks to a long-term effort on the part of the city, the school system has been involved in a consolidation effort, bringing the total number of elementary schools down from twenty-eight as recently as the 1990s to nine today: Spencer Borden Elementary in the southern Highlands, John J. Doran Elementary in the downtown area, Mary L. Fonseca Elementary in the Flint, William S. Greene Elementary near the city's center, Alfred S. Letourneau in the Maplewood neighborhood, Frank M. Silvia Elementary in the far North End, James Tansey Elementary in the middle Highlands, Carlton M. Viveiros Elementary in the South End, and James Watson Elementary in the lower Flint. Of the old twenty-eight, only Watson, Tansey and Doran remain in their original buildings; Silvia was relocated from its old location downtown to a new building in the northern part of the city, and the other five were rebuilt on the sites of their original schools. Also, most of the closed school names (except for Wiley and Dubuque) live on in the schools they were consolidated into. There are four middle schools: Matthew J. Kuss Middle School (which was relocated to the west side of the city), Henry Lord Middle School (serving the South End), James Morton Middle School (serving the North End), and Edmond P. Talbot Middle School (serving the east side of the city).\\n\\nThe city has one public high school, B.M.C. Durfee High School. The school was founded in 1886, replacing an older high school. The original grand school building was a gift of Mrs. Mary B. Young, in the name of Bradford Matthew Chaloner Durfee, her late son, whose name also graces a dormitory at Yale University. The current school building was opened in 1978, and it was recently announced that a replica of the Durfee Chimes, the original school's red-capped bell tower, will be recreated on the grounds.\\n\\nDurfee's teams wear black and red (in honor of the old school's black roof and red observatory dome and tower spire), and are called the Hilltoppers, sometimes shortened to Toppers. The nickname dates back to the old school's perch on top of the hill north of the Quequechan River. The school is a member of the Big Three Conference, where it competes with Brockton High School and its longtime natural rival, New Bedford High School.\\n\\nThe city is also the home of Diman Regional Vocational-Technical High School, which also serves the towns of Somerset, Swansea, and Westport. Famous chef Emeril Lagasse graduated from this high school, in the Culinary Arts Program that is still run today. The school's roots date back to the days of the Durfee Textile School, which branched out to include Diman. (The college, founded to promote the city's textile sciences, is now a part of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.)\\n\\nIn addition to public schools, there are several private and parochial schools in the city, including nine Catholic schools, two private schools, a Christian academy (East Gate Christian Academy), and Atlantis Charter School, a Pre-K through 8 charter school with a marine science-themed curriculum. The city is also home to Bishop Connolly High School, a Catholic high school named for Bishop James Louis Connolly, fourth Bishop of the Diocese of Fall River.\\n\\nThe University of Massachusetts Dartmouth has two branches in the city: the Professional and Continuing Education Center located at 139 South Main Street (in the 1917 Cherry & Webb building), and the Advanced Technical & Manufacturing Center at the Narrows, on the former site of the Kerr Mills. The school traces half of its roots back to the city; the Bradford Durfee Textile School was founded there in 1899, with its original 1904 building on the corner of Durfee and Bank Streets still standing. The building was also the original home of Bristol Community College, founded in 1965 and now located at 777 Elsbree Street. BCC is a two-year college offering associate degrees as well transfer programs to four-year institutions. The Eastern Nazarene College offers Adult Studies/LEAD classes in Fall River as well.\\n\\nthumbFall River established its public library in 1860. In fiscal year 2008, the city of Fall River spent 0.56% ($1,054,945) of its budget on its public library—some $11 per person.\\n\\nThe main location of the Fall River Public Library is located at 104 North Main Street, within the Downtown Fall River Historic District. It opened in 1899, and was designed by architect Ralph Adams Cram in the Renaissance Revival style. It is constructed from native Fall River granite. The building underwent an extensive renovation in the late 1990s.\\n\\nThe public library system also includes two branches; the South End Branch located at 1310 South Main Street, and the East End Branch located at 1386 Pleasant Street.\\n\\nthumbFall River has always been considered a transportation hub for the South Coast and Mount Hope Bay areas, due to its location along the Taunton River. In addition to the Fall River Line (discussed in the \"History\" section), Slade's Ferry ran from Fall River to Somerset since the 17th century, connecting the two communities. In 1875, Slade's Ferry Bridge was opened, connecting the two cities for trolley lines as well as cart (and later, car) traffic. It was a two-tiered steel swing span bridge, extending over  from Remington Avenue to the intersection of Wilbur Avenue, Riverside Avenue and Brayton Avenue in Somerset. This bridge was in use until 1970, when it was closed and subsequently demolished. (The path of the bridge is now roughly marked by twin sets of power lines crossing the river.) In 1903, the state authorized a second bridge, the Brightman Street Bridge, a four lane,  long drawbridge ending at its namesake street, which opened in 1908 and is still standing today. The third bridge to span the river in Fall River was the Charles M. Braga, Jr. Memorial Bridge. Started in 1959 and opened in the spring of 1966, the six-lane cantilever truss highway bridge spans  and was part of the project to build Interstate 195.\\n\\nIn the late 1980s, problems were beginning to arise with the Brightman Street Bridge. Currently 100 years old, it is often closed for repairs, which puts much strain on local traffic, forced to take long detours across the nearby Braga Bridge. In 1983 plans were being made to build a new bridge  north of the current one, which would directly link with Route 138. Plans were put on hold in 1989 due to Coast Guard concerns, but construction of the new span began in the late 1990s and continues today despite numerous delays and controversy. A new avenue to link the bridge and Route 6 in Somerset has already begun construction a few yards inland. As of yet, no name for the bridge has been decided upon.\\n\\nthumbthumb\\n\\nInterstate 195 is now the main point of entry for the city, entering via the Braga Bridge from Somerset and leaving over \"The Narrows,\" a small strip of land between the North and South Watuppa Ponds that carries Interstate 195, Route 6 and Old Bedford Road into Fall River from Westport as the roads make their way east towards New Bedford and Cape Cod. The highway covers much of the old path parallel to the Bay Colony/New Bedford Cape Cod Railroad as well the original path of the Quequechan River, and has resulted in a unique situation—it is one of the few highways in the country with a city hall (officially known as \"Fall River Government Center\") standing directly on top of it. The tunnel which passes below Government Center was the site of an accident in March 1999, in which a cement ceiling tile, its supports worn away by corrosion, collapsed, landed on several cars but causing only minor injuries. The incident caused major traffic problems in the area, and bears a striking resemblance to the incident involving the I-90 tunnel collapse (a part of the Big Dig) in 2006.\\n\\nIn addition to Interstate 195, Fall River is also served by four other major routes, which include Route 6 (which passes over the Brightman Street Bridge going west before joining the city grid then continuing east into Westport); Route 24, a 2 Lane North/South divided highway linking Fall River to Boston and Newport; Route 79, another divided highway that begins at the Braga Bridge and continues northbound to Route 24; Route 138, which also enters the city via the Brightman Street Bridge before joining the city grid, passing southwards towards Aquidneck Island; and Route 81, which begins near the former site of the Quequechan River and travels south into Tiverton. Additionally, Route 177 clips the extreme southern part of the city for less than  between Westport and Tiverton. Route 138, Route 24, I-195, and US 6 are based upon old Indian routes and trails.\\n\\nThe Fall River State Pier is still in operation, bringing goods into the city via boat and also by a freight train line which travels north from the pier parallel to Route 79. Plans are in the works to add commuter service along the current Stoughton Line of the MBTA's commuter rail line, which would also connect New Bedford.\\n\\nThe city, along with New Bedford, shares ownership of the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority (SRTA), a bus line which covers much of the south coast.\\n\\nUntil approximately 1990, the Fall River Municipal Airport served as a general aviation airport for small planes and commuter flights to the Cape and Islands just north of the junction of Routes 79 and 24, but the airport has since closed, the land claimed for an industrial park.\\n\\nFall River has a rich soccer history. The game was first introduced to the city in the 1880s by the arrival of immigrants from Lancashire and Glasgow who worked in the local textile industry. In later decades the arrival of immigrants from Portugal helped to sustain the game's popularity. Between 1888 and 1892 teams from Fall River won the American Cup five times in succession. One of these teams, Fall River Rovers also won the 1917 National Challenge Cup. The star and captain of the team was local-born Thomas Swords who, in 1916, captained the United States in their first official international.\\n\\nDuring the 1920s and early 1930s, Fall River Marksmen were one were one of the most successful soccer clubs in the United States and were American soccer champions on seven occasions. In 1932, another club, Fall River F.C., were also champions. \\n\\nThe Marksmen also won the National Challenge Cup four times. Among their most notable players were Billy Gonsalves and Bert Patenaude who were both raised in Fall River. In 1930 they both played for the United States at the first ever soccer World Cup. Patenaude, who died in Fall River on November 4, 1974, is credited with scoring the first ever hat-trick at a World Cup yet his feat wasn't officially recognized by FIFA until November 2006.\\n\\nDuring the 1940s, Ponta Delgada S.C. became one the most successful amateur teams in the United States. In 1947 the team was selected en masse to represent the United States at the North American soccer championship. In 1950 two of their local born players, Ed Souza and John Souza, played at the World Cup and helped the United States defeat England 1-0. \\n\\nDuring the FIFA World Cup 1930 held in Uruguay, Fall River native Bert Patenaude scored the first hat trick in World Cup history. He scored all three goals in the United States' 3-0 victory over Paraguay.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nsee \\n\\n*\\n\\n"}

Falling into You was well received by critics and fans, winning two Grammy Awards for Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year in 1997, and becoming one of the best-selling albums in history, with sales of over 32 million copies worldwide. It was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers in their Definitive 200 Albums of All Time as the 97th most influential and popular album in history.\\n\\nLet's Talk About Love / Falling into You / A New Day Has Come 3CD set was released in October 2007.

Also on October 2, 2009 Let's Talk About Love / A New Day Has Come 2CD set was released.\\n\\nFalling into You presented Dion at the height of her popularity, and showed a further progression of her music. In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements: ornate orchestral frills and African chanting, and instruments like the violin, Spanish guitar, trombone, the cavaquinho, saxophone and supreme string arrangements by Paul Buckmaster created a new sound. The singles encompassed a variety of musical styles: the title track and \"River Deep, Mountain High\" (a Tina Turner cover) made prominent use of percussion instruments; \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" (a remake of Jim Steinman's song) and a remake of Eric Carmen's \"All by Myself\" kept their soft-rock atmosphere, but were combined with the classical sound of the piano; and the maudlin ballad, \"Because You Loved Me,\" written by Diane Warren, served as the theme to the 1996 film Up Close &amp; Personal. The song was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1996, as well as four Grammy Award. Céline Dion performed at both ceremonies. The album included also Carole King's \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" and Marie Claire D'ubaldo's \"Falling into You.\"\\n\\n\"If That's What It Takes,\" \"I Don't Know,\" and \"Fly\" are the English adaptations of songs from the album D'eux.\\n\\nDion's status on the world stage was further solidified when she was asked to perform \"The Power of the Dream\" at the opening ceremonies of the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Céline Dion gave away the money she received for the occasion with a little extra to the Canadian team, to support Canadian athletes. The song was included on some limited editions of Falling into You in Asia and Australia.

During the ceremony, she sang \"Call the Man\" with a 30-voice gospel choir.\\n\\nDion went on the Falling into You Tour to support the album.\\n\\nThe album was met with generally favorable reviews. On the one hand, Dan Leroy wrote that Falling Into You was not very different from her previous work, and Stephen Holden of The New York Times and Elysa Gardner of Los Angeles Times wrote that the album was formulaic, and there was a lack of emotional connection to the songs. However, other critics such as Chuck Eddy, Erlewine and Daniel Durchholz lavished the album as \"compelling,\" \"passionate,\" \"stylish,\" \"elegant,\" and \"remarkably well-crafted.\"\\n\\nFalling into You remains one of the best-selling albums in history, with over 32 million copies sold worldwide.\\n\\nIn the United States, it debuted at number 2 with 193,000 copies sold in its first week.

{"title": "Falu red", "body": "thumb\\n\\nFalu red or Falun red (pronounced \"FAH-loo\", in Swedish Falu rödfärg) is the name of a Swedish, deep red paint well known for its use on wooden cottage and barn. The paint originated from the copper mine at Falun in Dalarna, Sweden. The traditional colour remains popular today due to its effectiveness in preserving wood. \\n\\nThe earliest evidence of its use dates from the 16th century. During the 17th century Falu red was commonly used on smaller wooden mansion, where it was intended to imitate buildings with brick facing. Except in bigger cities like Stockholm and Gothenburg, and in the far south of Sweden, wood was the dominating building material. In the Swedish cities and towns, buildings were often painted with the Falu red until the early 19th century, when the authorities began to oppose the paint. At this point in time more and more wooden buildings in urban areas were either painted in lighter colours (e.g. yellow, white) or sided with stucco. The number of buildings made of bricks (with stucco) also increased. However the Falu red saw a surge in popularity in the countryside during the 19th century, when also poorer farmer and crofter began to paint their houses. Falu red is still widely used in the Swedish countryside.\\n\\nthumbThe actual colour may be different depending on how much the oxide is burnt, ranging from almost black to a bright, light red. Different tones of red have been popular at different times. Recently a mix giving a dark green colour, Falu Grön, has also been produced by mixing black and ochre.\\n\\nThe paint consists of water, rye flour, linseed oil and residue from the copper mine of Falun which contain silicates iron oxides, copper compounds and zinc.

{"title": "Family (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)", "body": "Family is the sixth episode of season 5 of the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It was written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon and is the first and only episode of the series to feature the character of Tara Maclay as the central figure of the narrative.\\n\\nThe episode begins on the same night that previous episode ended. In Willow's dorm room, she and Tara enjoying each other's company: Tara tells Willow a story about a kitten, and then joins her in bed for a snuggle.\\n\\nThe same night, Buffy tells Giles the information that she discovered at the factory: that Dawn is the key, and that Glory is hell-bent on finding her. They decide to protect Dawn without telling others about it. Meanwhile, Glory easily frees herself from the collapsed factory rubble.\\n\\nAt the hospital, Ben enters the locker room. A moment later, Glory is there and captures a Lei-Ach demon, who tells her that Buffy is the Slayer. Glory sends it and its friends to kill her.\\n\\nBuffy decides to leave on-campus accommodation and move back to the Summers house to be closer to her ailing mother. The gang assists with packing boxes, and Willow reminds everyone about Tara's upcoming 20th birthday. Later at the magic shop, Buffy and Xander struggle to come up with ideas for presents for Tara, coming to the realisation that they don't really know her very well. They similarly struggle to find information on Glory, since Buffy's best description that she is \"kind of like Cordelia\" proves too vague to be of use.\\n\\nA young man comes into the Magic Box and disparages magic. He reveals himself as Tara's big brother, Donny, who has come to town with Tara's father and her cousin Beth for Tara's birthday. While Tara is clearly not thrilled at their presence, she agrees to have dinner with her family that evening.\\n\\nTara returns to her room to find her father there. He expresses disappointment that she has not quit magic and berates her for being out of reach for months. He reminds her (and reveals to the audience) that all women in the family show their demon selves after their 20th birthday, which is why her family has come for her. After he leaves, Willow returns and wants to repeat the demon location spell that Tara had secretly sabotaged previously. Tara fakes fatigue, so Willow returns to the magic shop. Tara secretly follows her and, from hiding, casts a spell to prevent her friends from seeing demonic manifestations of evil.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Riley is drinking alone in Willy's old demon bar after another argument with Buffy about her isolationism. Sandy hits on him, but he recognizes her as a vampire.\\n\\nIn his crypt, Harmony tells Spike that the Lei-Ach demons have been summoned to kill Buffy. Spike, who had earlier been fantasizing about fighting Buffy while having sex with Harmony, leaves to help, although tells Harmony that he is going to watch and enjoy her death.\\n\\nBeth finds Tara, and derides her for being \"selfish\", leaving her father and brother to \"do for themselves\". Beth realizes that Tara has cast a spell on her friends, then leaves to find Tara's father to inform him what his daughter has done.\\n\\nThree Lei-Ach demons arrive to attack Buffy, but because of Tara's spell they are invisible to the gang. They search for the Slayer and attack everyone in their path. Giles hides Dawn under a desk. Only Buffy manages to put up a decent fight. Spike arrives and fights one of the Lei-Achs, although being demon himself his entire scuffle is unseen by Buffy. Tara arrives, realizes her spell has gone awry, and breaks it. The demons can again be seen, and are quickly beaten.\\n\\nTara's family arrives. Her father explains that, because of demonic heritage, all of the women in their family turn evil when they become adults. Willow is visibly hurt that Tara has hidden this from her, and Tara tries to re-affirm her love for Willow. When Tara's family insists on taking her away against her wishes, all her friends make it clear they will fight to defend her, declaring that while the Maclays may be her blood kin, her friends are her real family.\\n\\nAnya then asks Tara's father what kind of demon she is. His refusal to give a straight answer arouses Spike's suspicion, so he punches Tara in the nose, activating Spike's chip and proving that Tara is, in fact, human. Spike concludes that the legend of the Maclay women assuming their demonic heritages upon adulthood is just an old family myth maintained by the Maclay males to keep their women frightened and subordinate to them. Bolstered by the knowledge that she is fully human, Tara declares she will stay with her new family, and confidently tells her relatives to leave, which they do after a slight hesitation.\\n\\nRiley arrives at the birthday party and kisses Buffy. Tara opens cheesy witch-related birthday presents from the gang, and everybody mingles. Tara and Willow embrace on the dance floor and begin to levitate.\\n\\nThis episode has Amy Adams as a guest star. She portrayed the role of Kathryn Merteuil in Cruel Intentions 2, role that was supported by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Buffy's protagonist actress, in the first movie.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Family Entertainment Protection Act", "body": "The United States Family Entertainment Protection Act (FEPA) was a bill introduced by Senator Hillary Clinton, and co-sponsored by Senators Joe Lieberman, Tim Johnson and Evan Bayh on November 29, 2005. The bill called for a federal mandate enforcement of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) ratings system for video games in order to protect children from inappropriate content.\\n\\nThe FEPA would have imposed fines of $1000 dollars or 100 hours of community service for a first time offense of selling a \"Mature\" or \"Adult-Only\" rated video game to a minor, and $5000 or 500 hours for each subsequent offense. The bill also called for a FTC investigation into the ESRB to ascertain whether they have been properly rating games.\\n\\nSimilar bills have been filed in some U.S. state such as Michigan and Illinois, but were ruled to be unconstitutional. (see Patrick R. Byrd, It’s All Fun And Games Until Someone Gets Hurt: The Effectiveness Of Proposed Video-Game Legislation On Reducing Violence In Children, at http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/44-2_pdf/5_Byrd.pdf)\\n\\nThis bill did not become law; it was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and expired at the end of the 109th session of Congress without further action.\\n\\nThe centerpiece of this bill is a prohibition against any business for selling or renting a Mature, Adults-Only, or Ratings Pending game to a person who is younger than seventeen. On-site store managers would be subject to a fine of $1,000 or 100 hours of community service for the first offense; $5,000 or 500 hours of community service for each subsequent offense. This provision is not aimed at punishing retailers who act in good faith to enforce the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) system. That’s why retailers would have an affirmative defense if they were shown an identification they believed to be valid or have a system in place to display and enforce the ESRB system. Similar prohibitions have become law in the last several months in California, Michigan, and Illinois.\\n\\nSince the bill relies on the video game industry to continue rating the appropriateness of games for minors, this bill requires an annual, independent analysis of game ratings. This analysis will help ensure that the ESRB ratings system accurately reflects the content in each game and that the ratings system does not change significantly over time.\\n\\nPart of the genesis of this bill was the revelation that the makers of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas had included, through embedded code that was discovered and made accessible to the public, sexually explicit content inconsistent with the game’s Mature rating. This bill requires the FTC to conduct an investigation to determine whether what happened with GTA: San Andreas is a pervasive problem. It also includes a Sense of Congress that the Commission shall take appropriate action if it determines that there is a pervasive problem.\\n\\nThis bill requires the Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP) of the FTC to ensure that consumers can file complaints if they find content to be misleading or deceptive and requires the BCP to report on the number of such complaints to Congress.\\n\\nThis bill authorizes the FTC to conduct an annual, random audit of retailers – sometimes referred to as a secret shopper survey – to determine how easy it is for young people to purchase Mature and Adults Only video games and report the findings to Congress.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Family Guy Video Game!", "body": "Family Guy Video Game! is an action-adventure video game based on the animated television series Family Guy. It was released for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PSP in North America on October 16, 2006, in Europe on December 1, 2006 and in Australia on November 3, 2006. The game was developed by High Voltage Software and published by 2K Games.\\n\\nThe game is split into 22 levels for the three playable characters: Peter, Stewie or Brian. Peter and Stewie have eight levels, while Brian has six. Each character has his own unique style of play.\\n\\nPeter's levels have a beat 'em up style, similar to Final Fight and Double Dragon. In Peter's levels, the player rampages across a section of town, attacking anyone and anything in his path. In addition, depending on the player's progression through the game, Peter will adopt a different persona as a result of head trauma, giving his attacks different animations but otherwise similar results. Peter's alter egos are Rufus Griffin, Hooker Peter and A.N.N.A. (Automaton Nuclear Neo-human Android), played in that order. Peter begins and ends the game as himself.\\n\\nStewie's levels resemble a shoot 'em up like Galaga or Space Invaders, but also with similarities to games like the ''Futurama'' video game. Stewie uses his upgradeable laser gun and conveniently placed \"sky hooks\" to move through various stages.\\n\\nBrian's levels have more in common with stealth game like Metal Gear Solid and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell. Brian must avoid detection by those around him, and can adopt disguises to fool onlookers. A secondary element in Brian's levels is avoiding his natural urge to urinate on things. Should the player remain near certain objects for too long (potted plants, fire hydrants, etc.), Brian will be forced to pee on them, exposing himself to those around him.\\n\\nA key feature of the game are mini-games done in the same style as the cutaway gags that the show is famous for, usually lasting less than 10 seconds. The mini-games often repeat cutaway gags from the shows, such as Peter inexplicably burning his hand in a waffle iron. Successfully completing the mini-game offers a bonus: Brian becomes invisible for a short period, while Peter and Stewie receive power-ups for their respective abilities.\\n\\nthumbStewie has built a mind control ray, and plans to use it in conjunction with Peter's satellite dish. However, his plans are interrupted by his half-brother Bertram, who claims to want his satellite dish. After making his way to the roof, Stewie decides that he would rather fail at world domination then let the satellite fall into his half-brother's hands, and self-destructs the satellite dish. However, Bertram reveals that he has come to trick him into destroying his own satellite, and he has begun a plan for world domination as well. He then leaves in his helicopter, and blasts Stewie off the roof. To discover Bertram's plans, Stewie infiltrates his lair in Peter's testicles. There, Stewie finds the location of Bertram's new lair and promptly lays waste to the facility. Stewie finds Bertram at the top of a missile silo, planning to launch the rocket into orbit so he can project his mind control beam around the world. To add insult to injury, Stewie's teddy bear, Rupert, has been placed inside the rocket. Stewie destroys the rocket, rescues Rupert, and has a final battle with Bertram at the playground. Bertram uses a device to grow to tremendous size, but is defeated anyway. Before Stewie can finish him off, he calls for his \"mommy\" to escape, leaving Stewie by flipping him off.\\n\\nBrian's section of the game sees him trying to prove his innocence when he is accused of once again impregnating Seabreeze. Brian is forced to escape from prison and follow a scent picked up from Seabreeze's genitals. This leads him to Tom Tucker at the Quahog News Station, which turns out to be a dead end. Brian's next stop is the Quahog Dog Races, where Brian, disguised as a food vendor, finds the scent on a discarded ticket stub. He takes Seabreeze's place in the race, wins (by drugging the other dogs), and draws the father out. Brian reveals that the father of Seabreeze's puppies is Quagmire, thereby clearing his name.\\n\\nPeter, after being smashed on the head by the PTV satellite dish, wakes up in the hospital and sees a spotlight identical to the Bat-Signal, only in the shape of Mr. Belvedere. Believing that Belvedere has kidnapped his family, Peter rampages across town in an effort to destroy him and save his family. He eventually arrives at Cheesie Charlie's, where he is hit in the head by the doors, opened by several African-Americans. Peter takes on the persona of Rufus Griffin and destroys the entire arcade before waking up in the closet. Seeing that the Belvedere signal is now at the Indian Casino, Peter travels there. As he enters, he takes another blow to the head when a hooker attempts suicide by jumping off the roof. Peter becomes Hooker Peter and destroys the casino. He then takes a fifth blow to the head, now seeing the Belvedere signal again at the docks. As he arrives, the debris of Bertram's rocket crashes on him, and Peter emerges as ANNA, an android programmed to destroy Mr. Belvedere. Crossing the dock and the beach, Peter arrives at a cave and is forced into battle with the Black Knight. Peter defeats the knight, but takes a final blow to the head when the knight's helmet falls off and hits him. When he comes to, Lois confronts him, furious that Peter had destroyed half of Quahog looking for Belvedere.\\n\\nIn the final level of the game, Peter decides to drown his sorrows at the Clam. There, he is confronted by Belvedere, who rips off a disguise revealing none other than Ernie the Giant Chicken. In the final battle of the game, Peter defeats Ernie, and just barely escapes a massive explosion in a penthouse, landing safely on top of Meg who, along with Lois and Chris, had inexplicably been standing in the middle of the street. After getting up from Meg and rejoining his family, Peter sees the Belvedere spotlight again which turns out to be Adam West making shadow puppets. The Chicken, as always, ends up surviving.\\n\\nTake-Two Interactive had attained the rights to publish a Family Guy video game by February 2005, before the series' revival episode \"North by North Quahog\" had aired. No further developments were made public until March 2006, when Take-Two subsidiary 2K Games had acquiesced the publishing rights, with High Voltage Software to fill in for development. The game predominantly uses the voice cast of the television series, and a cel-shaded visual style. The game was exhibited at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2006.\\n\\nThe game received mixed reviews. The review collation site Metacritic gave the Xbox version a score of 53%, the PSP version 52%, and the PlayStation 2 version 51%. X-Play gave the game 3 out of 5, mentioning Brian's levels as a weak point, and suggesting that there is little to recommend in the game beyond its humor. The Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine gave it a 3 out of 10 score, the main problems being broken AI, frustration and repetitive objectives. Another UK based PlayStation magazine, PSM3, gave it a 48 out of 100, with criticism toward uninspired levels, restrictive controls, and obscure references being the main reason for panning it. Game site IGN gave the game a 4.1 out of 10. However, it did win the \"Best Cast\" Award in 2006 on Spike TV's Video Game Awards.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fandi Ahmad", "body": " \\n\\nFandi Ahmad (born 29 May 1962) is a football coach and former professional footballer from Singapore. During his playing career, he enjoyed success playing in both Europe and Asia, and was captain of the Singapore national football team (1993–97). He is considered by many to be Singapore's best-ever football player, and Asia's best striker. His most regular playing position was that of striker, though he also sometimes played in midfield.\\n\\nIn 1978, at the age 16, Fandi then became the youngest-ever player ever to play for the Singapore national team (a feat erased in 2007 by young starlet Hariss Harun). In 1980 he was a member of the Singapore representative side which won the Malaysia Cup. He scored the winning goal in the final, where Singapore beat arch rivals Selangor 2-1.\\n\\nIn 1982, Fandi was offered a place at Ajax Amsterdam after a trial, but he rejected it due to his difficulties adapting to the language and lifestyle. Instead he chose to return to Asia and joined Niac Mitra in Indonesia.\\n\\nIn 1983, Fandi did move to the Netherlands, where he played for FC Groningen from 1983 to 1985 in the Dutch football league (Eredivisie). Prior to his arrival, Groningen had qualified for Europe football for the first time, and Fandi helped them in a dramatic European debut season by scoring in a shock 2-0 second round, first-leg win over Italian giants Inter Milan. During the 1983-84 season, Fandi scored 10 times in 29 games. While in his second season at the club, Fandi made 15 appearances, scoring 2 goals. Fandi made a big impact on the Groningen fans, in 1999 he was voted one of the best 25 players ever to play for FC Groningen, earning him a place in the club's Hall of Fame. In 2003, he was named in the club's best eleven of the twentieth century. \\n\\nAlthough Fandi was offered a place again at Ajax Amsterdam, he chose to return to Asia in 1986. (He has since said that he regretted not further plying his trade in Europe. Nottingham Forest made an informal enquiry about his availability in the late-1990s, but decided he was too old.) \\n\\nFandi's played for Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia from 1986 to 1990, helping them win the Malaysia Cup three times in 1987, 1988 and 1989. He also won the Malaysian Golden Boot Award in 1988. He then joined OFI Crete in Greece in 1990. But this stint in Europe lasted only a few months, and he returned to Malaysia to join Pahang in 1991, and helped them win the Malaysian League and Malaysia Cup double in 1992.\\n\\nIn 1993, Fandi returned to Singapore to play for the Singapore side in the Malaysian League. That year he tasted Malaysia Cup final defeat for the third time when Singapore were beaten 2-0 by Kedah. He also played in the 1979 and 1981 Malaysia Cup final when they were defeated on both occasions by Selangor. But the following year, with Fandi as captain, Singapore won the Malaysian League and Malaysia Cup double, and Fandi scored in the Malaysia Cup final as Singapore routed his former side Pahang 4-0. \\n\\n1994 was Singapore's last year of involvement in the Malaysian competitions, as the Football Association of Singapore decided to withdraw and focus on developing its own domestic tournaments. \\n\\nIn 1996, Singapore's new S.League was launched and Fandi captained Geylang United to winning the inaugural S. League championship title. Following that he moved to the Singapore Armed Forces Football Club (SAFFC) and captained them to winning the S. League title in 1997 and 1998. He then became SAFFC's coach and guided them to winning the S. League again in 2000. \\n\\nFandi won over 100 caps playing for the Singapore national team, scoring 50 goals. He helped Singapore win the Silver Medal at the Southeast Asian Games in 1983, 1985 and 1989. \\n\\nHowever, his contribution to Singapore football has not been recognised by FIFA, who have not included Fandi as one of Singapore's members in the Centurion Club.\\n\\nFandi's first coaching job was at SAFFC, who he guided to winning the S. League title in 2000.\\n\\nFandi was appointed a Council Member of the Football Association of Singapore in 2001, becoming the youngest person and the first former international player to achieve this. He continued to coach professionally in Singapore and served as Assistant Coach of the Singapore team which won the regional Tiger Cup competition in 2005. He also coached the national under-23 team and the Young Lions in the S.League. \\n\\nIn 2006, Fandi joined the Indonesian club Pelita Jaya as their coach on a three-year contract, reportedly for US$220,000 a year. In early 2010, he resigned from Pelita Jaya.\\n\\nFandi is the son of Ahmad Wartam, who was goalkeeper in the 1960s for Singapore's national football team.\\n\\nFandi is married to South Africa former model Wendy Jacobs (also known as Sarah Abdullah, now a naturalised Singaporean). The couple have five children. \\n\\nTwo of Fandi's children, Irfan and Ikhsan, received glowing reviews from Spanish scouts at AC Milan's junior training camp in Malaga, Spain, with Ikhsan scoring ten goals in two matches. The two boys were also invited to play in two of Valencia CF's academy team games. The duo, members of Arsenal's football school in Indonesia, and also represented their academy in the English club's global under-13 tournament.

{"title": "Fanfare Ciocărlia", "body": "thumbthumbthumb\\n\\nFanfare Ciocărlia is a popular twelve-piece Romani brass band from the northeastern Romania village of Zece Prăjini. The band began as a loose assemblage of part-time musicians playing at local weddings and baptisms. In October 1996, the German sound engineer and record producer Henry Ernst visited Zece Prajini and convinced a number of the musicians there to assemble a touring band. These musicians decided to name the band Fanfare Ciocârlia: Fanfare being a French word that has passed into Romanian and is used to designate a brass band; Ciocârlia being the Romanian word for the skylark. Since their discovery by Ernst, who serves as their manager, they have played more than thousand concerts in more than 50 countries across the globe. \\n\\nWith historical roots in Austrian and Turkish military bands, Fanfare Ciocărlia's instrumental lineup includes trumpet, tenor and baritone horns, tuba, clarinet, saxophone, bass drum and percussion. Their song lyrics are usually either in Romani or Romanian. Their musical style stems primarily from the traditions of Romani and Romanian folk dance music, but they also borrow freely from Turkish, Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian musical styles, and they incorporate a number of tunes gleaned from international radio, Hollywood and Bollywood in their broad repertoire as well. They are best known for a very fast, high-energy sound, with complex rhythms and high-speed, staccato clarinet, saxophone and trumpet solos, sometimes performed at more than 200 beats per minute. They are also known for using no sheet music in their performances, sometimes randomly blasting their horns and clarinets in the middle of a song, and for playing old, battered instruments onstage.\\n\\nThe band won the BBC Radio 3 World Music Award for Europe in 2006. Their latest release is entitled Queens and Kings.\\n\\nSongs from the debut album Radio Paşcani (\"Ah Ya Bibi\" in particular) have appealed greatly to American fans of Gypsy. American Gypsy musicians Balkanarama covered \"Ah Ya Bibi\" on their 2003 release Nonstop. The eclectic, Santa Cruz-based jazz/rock/metal act Estradasphere, who are known for frequently interpreting Gypsy music, often play \"Ah Ya Bibi\" at live shows (on their EP \"The Silent Elk of Yesterday\", the track is recorded under the title \"A Tune by F.F.C.\"). New York City's Hungry March Band covered their song \"Asfalt Tango\" on their On the Waterfront CD, and the Extra Action Marching Band recorded \"Ciocarlia Suite\" on their Live CD.\\n\\nFanfare Ciocârlia was even invited to play music at Danny Elfman's 50th birthday party in Hollywood during 2003.\\n\\nThe song \"Asfalt Tango\" was used by Basement Jaxx, a British electronic dance group, on the song \"Hey U\", which featured on their 2006 album Crazy Itch Radio.A cover version of the James Bond theme is included on the album Gypsy Beats and Balkan Bangers compiled by Basement Jaxx' Felix B\\n\\nThe full-length film Iag Bari - Brass on Fire, directed by Ralf Marscalleck, features the life of Fanfare Ciocărlia members, focusing on the small Romanian Gypsy village of Zece Prajini in contrast to the large concert venues the band attends. It would go on to win \"Best Documentary Award\" at the Festival De Cine Documental Musical in Barcelona and Madrid in November 2003. It was also awarded \"Best Long Documentary Award\" on the Romani Festival for TV and Radio Production Golden Wheel in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.\\n\\nThe band can also be spotted in the film Gegen die Wand (Head-On) by Turkish film director Fatih Akın. In 2004, the film won the Golden Bear at the International Film Festival in Berlin.\\n\\nThe song \"Asfalt Tango\" was the main track of the animated movie Fallen Art by Tomasz Bagiński.\\n\\nIn October 2004, Asphalt Tango Records released the first Fanfare Ciocărlia DVD that included a full live concert and Iag Bari, along with other video segments.\\n\\nFanfare Ciocărlia's version of \"Born to be Wild\" can be heard on the closing credits of Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\\n\\nTheir version of \"Moliendo Cafe\" can be heard throughout the Spanish comedy Crimen ferpecto\\n\\n"}

On leaving school early she commenced work on the same farm where her family lived. Motivated by the poverty she observed around her, she entered politics and was the first woman to be elected onto Wolstanton Council as a Labour member in 1923. In 1927 she retained her seat, this time standing as a Communist. She was a popular with local people, who nicknamed her \"Red Fanny\" after she visited the Soviet Union in 1927 and 1930.\\n\\nOf her five children only one survived into adulthood. In an era of high infant mortality she campaigned for better maternity care of women and free milk for children under five. Along with unemployed miners, she met at Downing Street Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald and as a result of this meeting local councils began to give free milk to pregnant mothers and children up to the age of five.\\n\\nOne of her friends was found guilty of inciting a riot and as a result of her evidence in providing an alibi she was charged with perjury and spent nine months in prison.\\n\\nIn 1934 she became a County Councillor in the recently merged Newcastle-under-Lyme Council, continuing her advocacy of child and maternal welfare issues through a number of different committees.

It sits in the middle of one of the biggest spreads of holiday parks in the United Kingdom. Whilst entry to the park is free, guests either pay per ride or purchase an unlimited ride wristband. The pay per ride option no longer uses tokens, instead uses a live ticket, which has a printed bar code that can be scanned to gain access to rides. This option allows credit to be added to the ticket to be able to ride rides in the park. Rides are priced at £1, £2, or £3 per ride depending on the ride type. \\n\\nWristbands with a printed barcode on are sold at costs between £6-22 depending on the time of year and promotional offers. This code must be scanned by a bar code reader which unlocks the turnstile at each ride platform. The design technique means that riders are unable to access the ride unless having first scanned their specially printed day-code.

{"title": "Farmers' Party (Ireland)", "body": "The Farmers' Party or Farmers' Union was an agrarian political party in the Irish Free State between 1922 and 1932. It was concerned almost exclusively with the interests of the agricultural community, and never sought to widen its scope beyond the countryside.\\n\\nThe party won seven seats in Dáil Éireann at the 1922 general election, the first in the Free State, and increased that total to fifteen in the 1923 election. These seats were concentrated in richer rural areas, an indicator that the party's support base was farmers with large holdings of land rather than the more numerous and poorer small farmers. At the1925 Seanad election, the party won three seats.\\n\\nDuring the 1920s, the Farmers' Party supported the Cumann na nGaedhael government. Support was strongest among the deputies who supported free trade. Among these members were the party leadership, particularly leader Denis Gorey, who proposed a merger of the Farmers' Party with Cumann na nGaedhael. Supporters of protectionism favoured continuation as an independent party, more criticism of the government, and from 1926 co-operation with the Fianna Fáil party, founded in 1926. This division between free-trading large farmers and protectionist small farmers harmed the party and eventually led to the partitioning of its votes between the two main parties. The pro-independence side won the tactical debate, and an embittered Gorey joined Cumann na nGaedhael in time for the June 1927 general election.\\n\\nThe party lost nine of its fifteen representatives in Dáil Éireann during 1927 to defections and two election defeats. It continued to support the Cumann na nGaedhael government throughout the late 1920s, most importantly in the vote of no confidence that preceded the September 1927 election. After that election, Farmers' Party leader Michael Heffernan was appointed to junior governmental office to ensure his party's support for the resulting minority government. Heffernan would himself join Cumann na nGaedhael before the subsequent election.\\n\\nBy the 1930s, the party had little representation and less hope for an independent future. The party's large farmer supporters had migrated to Cumann na nGaedhael, while it had never truly succeeded in becoming the dominant party among small farmers, whose affinity was with Fianna Fáil. After the 1932 general election, only a small core of intransigents unwilling to co-operate with either Cumann na nGaedhael or Fianna Fáil remained in Dáil Éireann. These deputies folded the Farmers' Party into the new National Centre Party and contested the 1933 election under that banner.\\n\\nIn the late 30's attempts were made to refound a new farmers party. The new party split, the Irish Farmers Federation, split over the derating issue with many small farmers opposed to the measure, believing that an increase in indirect taxation which would be employed would harm their interests. They set up Clann na Talmhan, which was launched in 1938. It was much more radical and left wing than the original farmers party and garnered support from mainly small farmers.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Farofa", "body": "thumb\\n\\nFarofa is a toasted manioc flour mixture, though variants are made with maize flour (farinha de milho), and flavors can vary. It is eaten in South America and West Africa, especially in Brazil and Nigeria, where a variant is known as gari. It can be found commercially produced and packaged but is often prepared at home based on family recipes. Most recipes will also contain varying amounts of salt, smoked meat, and spice. The consistency of the mixture ranges from large grains the size of cracked bulgur wheat or couscous down to a table-salt-sized powder. Most farofas have a very smoky and slightly salty taste, by and large used to accentuate the taste of meat, particularly barbecued meat and hearty stews. \\n\\nIn Brazil, where farofa is particularly popular, typical recipes call for raw manioc flour to be toasted with butter, salt, and bacon until golden brown. It is an essential accompaniment to feijoada. In Brazil, farofa is also used in a stuffing for poultry and other dishes, usually containing raisins, nuts and/or finely chopped sweet fruits like apples and bananas.\\n\\nFarofa is served alongside the main course and can either be sprinkled on by individual diners to their taste before eating, or eaten as an accompaniment in its own right, as rice is often consumed.\\n\\nIn West Africa there are two types; \"white\" and \"yellow\" gari. The yellow gari is prepared by frying with the addition of palm oil to give it an orange-like colour; while white garri is fried without palm oil. In the Western parts of Africa, yellow garri is more sought after; hence it is more expensive than the white flavour.\\n\\nGarri can be eaten without further cooking by placing in a bowl and adding cold water. Sugar or honey is sometimes added to sweeten the taste.It can also be converted into a breakfast cereal by adding powdered milk, chunks of coconut, groundnuts and cashewnuts. Most garri, however, is cooked by adding to boiling water and stirring to make a stiff paste or porridge, which in Nigeria is known as ẹbà. Most parts of Africa where cassava is grown have an equivalent staple dish.\\n\\n[[jp:Farofa´´\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Farsala", "body": "Farsala (), known in Antiquity as Φάρσαλος, Pharsalos or Pharsalus, is a city in southern Thessaly, in Greece. Farsala is located in the southern part of Larissa Prefecture, and is one of its largest cities. The city is linked with GR-3, the old highway linking Larissa and Lamia and is also accessed by GR-30 linking Karditsa and Volos. The GR-1/E65 and E75 superhighway runs to the east of the city. Several mountain ranges lie to the South, while the Thessalian Plain lies to the North, some hills to the East and the Farsalian Fields in the central part. Farsala is located SE of Karditsa, S of Larissa, W of Volos and N of Lamia.\\n\\nThe area is an economic and agricultural centre of the province. The population are mainly rural especially with cotton production and breeding, one of the many are in local production units in agricultural production as well as clothing and textile industries. Farsala is famous for its distinctive halva. The population (2006) is about 13,500. The population in 1981 was 7,094, in 1991 8,413 and in 2001 9,801.\\n\\nThe Homeric Phthia of the Mycenaean period, capital of the Kingdom of the Myrmidons and of Peleus, father of Achilles, has sometimes been identified with the later city of Farsalos (Greek: Φάρσαλος), now Pharsala. A Cyclopean Wall which protected a city still exists today near modern Pharsala, as does a vaulted tomb from that period.\\n\\nThe Pharsalos of the historic era was built over a hillside of the Narthacius mountains at an elevation of some 160 m, where modern Pharsala stands. It was one of the main cities in Thessaly and was the capital of the Phthian tetrarch. In the Persian Wars it sided with the Athenians. A distinctive tribe of the city was that of Echecratidon. In the early-4th century BC, the city was a part of the Thessalian Commons. Later, it joined the Macedonian Kingdom under Philip II. The area became a theatre of war where the Aetolians and the Thessalians clashed with the Macedonians, especially during the Second and the Third Macedonian War. After the defeat of the Macedonian Kingdom, Pharsalos and the whole area became a part of the Roman Republic. The whole area suffered great destruction during the Roman Civil War. The Battle of Pharsalus took place in 48 BC in the fields of the Pharsalian Plain, where Julius Caesar defeated Pompey.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe geographer Strabo speaks of two towns, Old Pharsalos (Palaepharsalos) and Pharsalos, existing in historical times. His statement (9.5.6) that the Thetideion, the temple to Thetis south of Skotoussa, was “near both the Pharsaloi, the Old and the New”, seems to imply that Palaepharsalos was not itself close by Pharsalos. Although the battle of 48 BC is called after Pharsalos, four ancient writers - the author of the Bellum Alexandrinum (48.1), Frontinus (Strategemata 2.3.22), Eutropius (20), and Orosius (6.15.27) - place it specifically at Palaepharsalos. In 198 B.C. Philip V had sacked Palaepharsalos (Livy 32.13.9). If that town had been close to Pharsalos he would have sacked both, and Livy would have written “Pharsalus” instead of “Palaepharsalus”. The British scholar F. L. Lucas demonstrated (Annual of the British School at Athens, No. XXIV, 1919-21) that the battle of 48 BC must have been fought north of the Enipeus, near modern-day Krini; and John D. Morgan in “Palae-pharsalus – the Battle and the Town” (The American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 87, No. 1, Jan. 1983), suggests that Krini is built on the site of Palaepharsalos, where the old road south from Larissa emerged from the hills on to the Pharsalian Plain.\\n\\nFarsala was known as \"Çatalca\" during Ottoman rule. Farsala was liberated from the Ottoman Empire in 1881 and together with the rest of Thessaly became part of the Hellenic Kingdom. During the first Greco-Turkish War (1897), a major battle took place in the vicinity of Farsala.\\n\\nHilari Bell has written a series of three books called;Fall of a Kingdom, Rise of a Hero and Forging the Sword, which take place in a fictional location called Farsala.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fast Attack Boats", "body": "Fast Attack Boats is a board game simulating naval combat between Arab and Israel missile boat during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. The game is an introductory level product with an emphasis on playability over historical accuracy.\\n\\nYaquinto Publications in 1980 issued Fast Attack Boats as one in their series of \"Album Games\", which used the same jacket as a double vinyl record album, with the mapboard printed inside the jacket and game components stored in the two pockets.\\n\\nFast Attack Boats may be played to represent a single engagement under the \"Battle Game\" rules, or a series of up to ten engagements under the \"Strategic Game\" rules. The mechanics of both are identical with the exception of fleet selection and deployment.\\n\\nIn the Battle Game, players agree upon a common total number of points for each fleet and select naval units of varying point values until each fleet has reached its limit. All units are immediately deployed, Arab units forming a line on one side of the mapboard and Israeli units on the other. The rectangular shape of the mapboard, long missile ranges, and the requirement for boats to use their full movement value often lead the two opposing sides into simple head-on charges. The range, large quantity and high degree of destructiveness of the cruise missile also typically leaves the much shorter range guns and torpedoes to play a minimal role near the end of an engagement, and the confines of the mapboard limit boats trying to maneuver. Most battle games, therefore, are completed in 15–30 minutes or less and involve a significant degree of luck over skill. The winning player is the one with the last surviving boat on the mapboard.\\n\\nThe Strategic Game requires the use of all naval units, and divides the forces into three sides (Egypt, Syria and Israeli). The Arab player divides up the Egyptian and Syrian fleets for five rounds of combat each, while the Israeli player must fight all ten engagements (5 rounds against each Arab power). There is provision for players to shift forces from one round to the next, but the Egyptian and Syrian fleets operate independently and may not combine, a restriction the Israeli player does not face. The movement and combat sequence of play is identical to the Battle Game. The Strategic Game is slightly more complex than the Battle Game and may require three or more hours to resolve, but is still predominantly a game of chance. The winner is the first player to reach six victories, or in the event of an even number of victories, the side that lost the fewest total points in the values of the eliminated boats.\\n\\nThe Arab fleet is composed of Komar and Osa boats armed with Styx missiles and P4 torpedo boat. The Israeli fleet is made up of assorted Saar boats equipped with a mix of Gabriel Mk1 and Mk2 missiles and torpedoes.\\n\\nAlternative rules include allowing two persons to play the Arab fleets in the Strategic Game, thus creating a three-player game; permitting the Israeli player to move less than the full movement factor to reflect Israel's better trained crews; and making ramming more difficult.\\n\\nFast Attack Boats admittedly does not attempt to replicate the lopsided naval engagements that took place during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, but instead is designed as a game that \"captures the flavor of the actual events.\" Consequently, it does not simulate any particular naval exchange or geographic area, instead opting for generic open seas engagements with player-selected fleets.\\n\\nThe rulebook's \"Brief Historical Summary\" incorrectly characterizes the 1973 Arab-Israel War's naval encounters as \"one of the most decisive and stunning victories by a weaker power in the history of sea warfare,\" and that if \"the Arab powers had been able to gain control of the sea, they could have disrupted the flow of supplies to Israel, which could have meant disaster for the hard-pressed Israeli Army.\" While the Israeli Navy's performance was impressive, it was not one of naval history's stunning victories and had no effect on the ground campaigns in the Golan or the Sinai where the conflict was decided. Moreover, while the United States did begin resupplying Israel at the end of the first week of the war, these military supplies were sent via air, and even then arrived too late and in too few quantities to influence the outcome of the war. The legacy of the conflict instead lies in the debut of electronic countermeasures in naval combat and the widespread use of cruise missiles.\\n\\nThe designer also takes liberties with the actual equipment and tactics both sides employed during the conflict. For example, Fast Attack Boats does not factor in Israel's highly effective electronic countermeasures that rendered the Arab Styx missiles largely useless, or the Syrian fleet's use of unwitting merchant ships to hide behind from incoming Israeli Gabriel missiles. The rules do devote significant attention to ramming an opponents boat, although this tactic was not used in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and is generally not a feature of 20th century naval combat, but probably reflects the narrow confines of the mapboard and the near inevitability of the two fleets crossing one another's path during game play.\\n\\n179 die-cut counters representing Egyptian, Israeli, and Syrian boats and missiles; a 12\" by 24\" hexagon-patterned abstract scale mapboard, two plastic bags, a game card each for the Arab and Israeli players, and a rulebook.

On October 28, 2005, Type-Moon released a sequel to Fate/stay night, entitled Fate/hollow ataraxia. Its plot is set half a year after the events of Fate/stay night.\\n\\nFate/stay night has made transitions into other media. A manga series based on the visual novel was first serialized in the Japanese magazine Shōnen Ace and published by Kadokawa. The manga is illustrated by Japanese artist Nishiwaki Datto and is currently ongoing. In 2007 the manga was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Tokyopop. A twenty-four episode anime series created by Studio Deen aired in Japan between January 6, 2006, and June 16, 2006. The anime series were initially licensed and released in North America by Geneon Entertainment, however On July 3, 2008 Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment announced an agreement to distribute select titles in North America including Fate/stay night. On November 22, 2006, Type-Moon announced a series of light novels entitled Fate/Zero, set as is a prequel to Fate/stay night. There have been four video games based on the series to date.

A PSP RPG entitled Fate/Extra was released on July 22, 2010. A Fate/stay night film was also created by Studio Deen and was released in Japanese theaters on January 23, 2010.\\n\\nFate/stay night's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears, representing either dialogue between the characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Often, players will come to a \"decision point\" where they are given the chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. The time between these decision points is variable and during these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction. In order to view the available plot lines to their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different choices to further the plot in an alternate direction.\\n\\nThere are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all three plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction.\\n\\nFate/stay night chronicles a two-week period in the life of Shirō Emiya, an amateur mechanic who attends a school named Homurabara Gakuen in Fuyuki City, Japan. The story primarily takes place at and around Shirō Emiya house, which acts as their base location in the Holy Grail War. Outside of Shirō's house, frequented locations include the Homurabara Gakuen high school, and the Ryūdōji Temple.\\n\\nThe main theme in Fate/stay night is \"conquering oneself.\" There are three story lines in Fate, each has a different theme. The first one is the \"oneself as an ideal.\" The second one is \"struggling with oneself as an ideal.\" The third one is \"the friction with real and ideal.\"\\n\\nThe player assumes the role of Shirō Emiya, the protagonist of Fate/stay night. He is a serious yet helpful, hardworking, and honest teenager. His hobbies include fixing a variety of broken things, from VCRs to stoves, as well as cooking and cleaning. He has some slight talent with sorcery, though he was discouraged by his foster father Kiritsugu Emiya from improving his gifts. Saber is Shirō's Servant and one of the main heroines. Shirō unwittingly summons Saber to fight with him in the Holy Grail War. She is an agile and powerful warrior; loyal, independent, and reserved, Saber acts coldly but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Saber is frustrated by Shirō's \"protective\" tendencies, believing his erratic and reckless behavior will jeopardize her chances of winning the Holy Grail War.\\n\\nThe second of the three heroines is Rin Tōsaka, a model student and idol of Shirō's school who is secretly a sorceress and Master in the Holy Grail War. She is a descendant from a long line of sorcerers, and though she lacks a formal magic education, she is extremely powerful in her own right. She is perceptive, resourceful and avidly competitive. The final heroine is Sakura Matō, a student in her first year of high school, and the adopted sister of Shinji Matō. After Shirō's father Kiritsugu died, Sakura often visited Shirō's home to help him with his daily chores. Sakura is outwardly shy and timid, but possesses great inner strength. She has a long standing and obvious crush on the oblivious Shirō Emiya.\\n\\nThe story of Fate/stay night revolves around the main protagonist Shirō Emiya, a young male high school student. When Shirō was a child, his father told him how he had failed at his life ambition to become a \"Hero of Justice\". Shirō affirms to his foster father that he intends to devote his life to achieving that distant ideal, much to Kiritsugu's chagrin. To do this, Shirō pleads with a begrudging Kiritsugu to teach him sorcery; but being born without the capabilities of a magus, Shirō proves to be talentless in almost all the fundamental sorcerous disciplines.\\n\\nWhen the story begins, Fuyuki City is the setting for a secret and violent war among competing magi. For the past two centuries, seven sorcerers have gathered and engage in a Battle Royale, each gambling his or her own life to obtain the Holy Grail, a legendary chalice capable of granting wishes. The past four Holy Grail Wars have typically occurred every sixty years, with the most recent concluding a decade ago, but the fifth war has started prematurely.\\n\\nEach of the sorcerers, better known as Masters, is aided by one of the seven summoned spiritual familiars known as Servants, who are the reincarnations of legendary souls from all across time. These resurrected souls possess superhuman characteristics and wield powerful artifacts or abilities called Noble Phantasms. Only one Servant can be summoned in each war from one of seven classes: Saber, Archer, Lancer, Berserker, Rider, Assassin, and Caster.\\n\\nAfter cleaning his school's kyūdō dojo late one night, Shirō stumbles upon two Servants, Archer and Lancer, battling in the school courtyard. To avoid compromising the war's secrecy, Lancer hunts down and pierces Shirō's heart with his Noble Phantasm Spear. Shirō is then discovered near death by Rin Tōsaka and because of his relationship with her sister Sakura Matō, she uses an heirloom filled with concentrated magic, Mana, to restore his damaged heart and leaves before he awakens. Shaken and dazed, Shirō picks up the heirloom and returns home only to be assaulted a second time by Lancer. Shirō weakly defends himself against Lancer using posters he turns to metal with magic reinforcment, but is soon overwhelmed by the powerful Servant's attack, and is sent flying into his shed. Cornered, Shirō prepares for the worst; but before Lancer can inflict another fatal blow, a magical mark on Shirō's hand begins to light up and a summoning circle used previously by his foster father inside the shed begins to glow. A young woman clad in armor with an invisible sword is summoned and blocks Lancer's attack. After driving Lancer away from Shirō, she introduces herself as \"Servant Saber\".\\n\\nKinoko Nasu first began writing Fate/Stay Night in college and had not intended it to be a game. Initially, Nasu only wrote what would become the game's \"Fate\" storyline however the game went on to have three storylines, the Fate storyline being one of them. In his early drafts, Fate's heroine Saber was a man, and the protagonist was a girl with glasses. Nasu set aside the project and went on to found Type-Moon with artist Takashi Takeuchi. \\n\\nAfter the success of their first visual novel Tsukihime in 2000 Type-Moon transitioned from a dojin soft organization to a commercial organization. Nasu and Takeuchi decided to turn the old Fate story into a visual novel as Type-Moon's first commercial product. In the beginning, Nasu was worried that because the main character was a girl, the story might not work as a bishōjo game. It was artist Takeuchi who suggested switching the genders of the protagonist and Saber to fit the game market.\\n\\nThe Fate/stay night franchise began as a visual novel video game created by Type-Moon which premiered in Japan on January 30, 2004. An all-ages version of Fate/stay night, entitled Fate/stay night Réalta Nua, for the PlayStation 2 was scheduled to be released in fall-winter of 2006. However, it was not released until April 19, 2007 due to a postponement. Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel are the three branching storylines found within the game.\\n\\nOn October 28, 2005, Type-Moon released a sequel to Fate/stay night, entitled Fate/hollow ataraxia. Its plot is set half a year after the events of Fate/stay night and features new characters such as Avenger, Bazett Fraga McRemitz, and Caren Ortensia, alongside returning characters such as Shirō Emiya and Rin Tōsaka.\\n\\nThe Fate/stay night manga, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the manga magazine Shōnen Ace, published by Kadokawa Shoten, on December 26, 2005. It is an adaption of the Fate/stay night visual novel, rather than the anime. In contrast to the anime, the manga focuses solely on the Unlimited Blade Works scenario of the game (albeit with slight deviations), and has refrained from pooling story elements from the sister scenarios, Fate or Heaven's Feel. The manga was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Tokyopop in 2007. Thirteen bound volumes have been released in Japan.\\n\\nHimuro no Tenchi Fate/School Life is a comedy 4-koma manga revolving around the normal life at school of the minor characters of Fate/stay night and Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, specifically the character Kane Himuro, classmate of Fate/stay night protagonist Shirō Emiya. It is serialized Manga 4-koma Kings Palette and currently three volumes have been published by Ichijinsha.\\n\\nA spin off manga series Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya written and illustrated by Hiroyama Hiroshi it was first serialized in Comp Ace in 2008 and later release into two bound volume. The series features Illya as a main character where she's living an alternate life as a school girl. However, she is chosen by the Magical Stick Ruby and is involved in a quarrel between Rin and Luvia. Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 2wei continued the series in 2009, with the same artist and publisher.\\n\\nThe Fate/stay night anime series aired between January 6, 2006, and June 16, 2006, containing 24 episodes; the storyline follows mainly the Fate scenario but shows parts of other scenarios as well. It was animated by Studio Deen and produced by the Fate Project, which was formed in response to the popularity of the visual novel and included Geneon Entertainment, TBS, CREi, Type-Moon, and Frontier Works Inc. The series later received its international television premieres on the anime television network Animax in 2007, its English-language television premiere occurring on Animax's English networks in Southeast Asia in June as well as its other networks in South Korea, Hong Kong and other regions. Geneon also licensed the series for distribution across North America. On July 3, 2008, Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment announced an agreement to distribute select titles in North America. While Geneon Entertainment still retains the license, Funimation Entertainment assumes exclusive rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of select titles. Fate/stay night was one of several titles involved in the deal.\\n\\nThe anime is an adaptation of the Fate/stay night visual novel, featuring content from all of the available scenarios in the original game's release. The general direction of the anime borrows heavily from the Fate scenario, with select segments from Unlimited Blade Works included as filler while only a couple nods are given toward the Heaven's Feel option. Elements from Fate/hollow ataraxia not directly impacting the plot were included, but sparingly. Kenji Kawai composed the original music for the series and also remixed four symphonic themes from the Fate/stay night visual novel for use in the anime: \"Hizashi No Naka De\" (not featured on the original anime soundtrack, but on the out tracks album \"LA SOLA\"), \"Yakusoku Sareta Shouri No Tsurugi\", \"Emiya\", and \"This Illusion\", the latter of which was retitled \"disillusion\".\\n\\nThe television series was re-released in Japan on January 22, 2010 in two 60-minute special edition DVD/BD volumes to commemorate the release of the film Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works. Fate/stay night TV reproduction I and II each recap 12 episodes from the anime and feature re-edited and re-compiled footage along with new opening and ending animation footage, with new ending songs by Jyukai and Sachi Tainaka. The opening song \"disillusion -2010-\" is a re-recording of the \"disillusion\" theme song from the television series.\\n\\nOn November 22, 2006, Type-Moon announced a new installment in the Fate/stay night franchise, entitled Fate/Zero. Fate/Zero is a prequel to Fate/stay night, stressing the events of the 4th Holy Grail War and how its consequences affected the 5th Holy Grail War. In contrast to Fate/stay night, Fate/Zero is a series of light novels instead of a visual novel, and will be told in a third person narrative that follows the actions of multiple characters. The series is a collaboration between Type-Moon and a fellow developer, Nitroplus. The first volume was released on December 29, 2006. The second volume was released on March 31, 2007. The third volume was released on July 27, 2007. The fourth and final volume was released on December 29, 2007, along with the Fate/Zero Original Image Soundtrack \"Return to Zero\".\\n\\nIn 2007 Fate/tiger colosseum, a 3D fighting game based on Fate/stay night, was released for the PlayStation Portable by Capcom and cavia, inc. in cooperation with TYPE MOON. The characters are all rendered in a super deformed style. A sequel, Fate/tiger colosseum Upper, was released on August 28, 2008. \\n\\nAnother fighting game based on the franchise titled Fate/Unlimited Codes was debuted at the 2008 Amusement Machine Operators' Union (AOU) show in Japan.

Players take on the role of an unnamed male or female character that the player chooses to be one of seven chosen masters and control servants Saber, Archer or Caster. The game was released for the PlayStation Portable in both regular and the \"Type-Moon Box\" editions. The limited, Type-Moon Box edition includes a Saber Figma figure from the game itself, a visual book and a limited edition soundtrack. While the original release was set for March 2010, the release date was pushed back to July 22, 2010 for further testing.\\n\\nAn animated film based on the storyline of the Unlimited Blade Works route from the visual novel was released in Japanese theaters on January 23, 2010 and produced by Studio Deen. The staff from the anime television series, including director Yuji Yamaguchi, return to work on the film, and most of the voice cast reprise their roles. The film earned 0.28 billion yen at the Japanese Box Office.\\n\\nThere is a soundtrack to the game, called Fate/Stay Night Original Sound Track. There is also an arranged soundtrack of the game music, entitled Avalon - Fate/Stay Night. It is arranged by WAVE and K. JUNO and features two English arranged versions of \"This Illusion\" titled \"Illusion/Vision\" and \"Illusion/Fate\". The anime original soundtrack was arranged and composed by Kenji Kawai.

There is a Fate/tiger coliseum OST and an imaged sound track for Fate/zero entitled Return to Zero.\\n\\nWhen released on January 30, 2004, Fate/stay night rapidly became one of the most popular visual novels in history, securing the title of \"highest selling visual novel\" in 2004. \\n\\nIn early 2007, the popularity of Fate/stay night and the anime seiyū lead to the launch of the Fate/stay tune internet radio drama, featuring the voice talent of Kana Ueda and Ayako Kawasumi. Another project elaborating on Fate/stay night canon has been planned, but as is the case with Fate/Zero, Type-Moon itself will have little, if any, direct involvement.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Father's Day (Doctor Who)", "body": "Father's Day is an episode in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast on 14 May 2005. The Doctor brings Rose to 1987 to witness her father's death but when she prevents his death from happening, the monstrous Reapers are unleashed upon the Earth.\\n\\nThis episode marks the first appearance of Rose Tyler's father Pete Tyler played by Shaun Dingwall, who would later reprise his role in the 2006 series as a Pete from a parallel universe.\\n\\nThe episode opens with a flashback of Jackie telling a younger Rose about her father Pete, who died on 7 November 1987, the day their friends Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clarke got married. She tells Rose that no one was around when Pete died after being run over by a hit-and-run driver.\\n\\nIn the present on the TARDIS, Rose asks the Doctor if they can go back to the day her father died so that she can be there when it happens. The Doctor agrees. They watch as Pete, leaving his car, is struck by a hit-and-run driver. Rose is unable to move when the Doctor tells her to go and be with her dad, and Pete soon dies. After Rose recovers, she asks the Doctor if she can try again with the time machine. The Doctor, against his judgment, allows it, but warns Rose to not run until their former selves have left to prevent a paradox. As the accident happens, Rose runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life, but causing her former selves to vanish. The Doctor angrily warns Rose about the damage to the timeline but Rose dismisses it, believing Pete to just be an average person. While Rose goes with Pete to the wedding, the Doctor storms back to the TARDIS, only to find that it is now an empty shell and realizes something is very wrong. Elsewhere, strange flying beasts appear and begin consuming people.\\n\\nAs Rose and Pete drive to the wedding, Rose observes strange anachronistic events, such as \"Don't Mug Yourself\" by The Streets playing on Pete's radio, and an unidentified voice message on her phone stating \"Watson, come here, I need you.\" At the church, the same car that nearly ran Pete over reappears and almost runs him down, but he dodges it, and the car disappears again. As they mill with the guests, including Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her, young Mickey Smith runs up to the party and warns that all his friends were taken by beasts. At the same time, the Doctor reaches the church and warns everyone inside just as one of the flying beasts appears and attacks the party. With the surviving members safely in the church, the Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a time paradox, which the Time Lord, if they were still around, would be able to fix; instead, the flying creatures are like bacteria, sterilizing the wound in time by consuming everything inside it, though the age of the church will protect them. As they talk, the key to the TARDIS starts glowing and heating up, and the Doctor realizes that he can summon it and use it to fix the problem, but warns everyone to not touch it until the process is complete. The Doctor also warns Rose not to touch her younger self, as this will further damage the time stream.\\n\\nAs they wait for the TARDIS to fully reappear, Pete overhears the Doctor and Rose talking, and realize that Rose is his daughter. When he approaches her and asks her about how good a father he is, Rose is unable to answer truthfully. Jackie, seeing Pete talk to Rose, believes Pete is having an affair with her, but in order to show that Rose is really their daughter, he thrusts the infant Rose into Rose's arms. As the Doctor warned, this causes a paradox that allows one of the beasts to appear in the church. The Doctor, as the oldest being there, sacrifices himself as the beast rushes to the crowd, causing it, the Doctor, and the faint TARDIS image to disappear, leaving the TARDIS key cold. As the group tries to figure out what to do next, Pete watches the same car that tried to run him over appear and disappear over and over again. He comes to the conclusion that he was meant to die by that car, and determines that by letting himself die, the timeline will be repaired. He has an emotional goodbye with Jackie and Rose, and then runs out to face the car the next time it appears. Pete is fatally struck by the car, but in that instant, the timeline is restored: all those consumed by the beasts reappear, including the Doctor, while the others, save for Rose and Pete, are unaware of the events. Rose runs to Pete's side and quietly stays with him until he dies. Rose returns to the Doctor, and the two walk hand-in-hand back to the restored TARDIS.\\n\\nThe episode ends on a similar flashback as the opener, as Jackie explains to a young Rose that Pete didn't die alone - a young woman stayed with him until he died, leading the adult Rose to eulogise about Pete Tyler, her father, \"the most wonderful man in the world\".\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fathom Five (novel)", "body": "Fathom Five by Robert Westall is a children's historical novel set during the Second World War, the sequel to The Machine Gunners. It was first published in 1979.\\n\\nThe novel reunites some of the characters from The Machine Gunners, specifically Chas McGill, \"Cem\" Jones and Audrey Parton, whilst introducing the middle-class Sheila as Chas's sometime girlfriend.\\n\\nSet in 1943, two years after the events of The Machine Gunners, it traces the attempt to uncover a spy in Garmouth.\\n\\nThe novel has an older theme to it than The Machine Gunners, in line with the characters' own growth.\\n\\nThe relationship between Chas and Sheila explores all the hope and inexperience of first love. The transition from boy to man is one of the central aspects of the novel. Chas is ultimately faced with a decision a mature adult would find daunting.\\n\\nWhilst The Machine Gunners tends to focus on the bombing and fear of invasion in 1941, Fathom Five fleshes out the world war. The ongoing effects of four years of rationing are covered (examples: Chas putting a hole in his trousers; the items brought by the different protagonists to the beach picnic; the Ministry of Food invitation to \"Try our delicious Woolton pie\"). There is reference to the diaspora that has fled to Britain including Scandinavian fishermen, the Maltese underclass and Jewish pawnbrokers. It is through one of these that Chas encounters a widow of the Arctic convoys, which puts a distinctly human perspective on war. In addition the sheer banality of continuing war is alluded to, and a sense of late war fatigue which began to grip Britain at this time; reference is made to miners striking for better pay, and shipyard workers stealing iron rations from lifeboats leading to torpedoed sailors starving.\\n\\nAs the plot develops the author explores the social forces at work in 1943 Britain. Chas, the son of a gas fitter, embarks on a tentative relationship with Sheila, the daughter of a prominent local magistrate. Chas is initially seduced by \"adults who you could discuss T. S. Eliot with\", but the relationship is not approved of by Sheila's parents. In the end it is Chas's father who clarifies matters. The McGill family bookshelf consists of a shelf of Left Book Club titles including, we are lead to understand, Orwell's Homage to Catalonia. Chas becomes an avid reader of these and starts to understand the society in which he lives.\\n\\nThe book is largely unsentimental. The Maltese of the Low Street are described in pungent detail as petty criminals and vice merchants although Chas does establish a friendship with some of them. This is a development of the theme of maturity and also Chas's growing sense of political identity informed by what he has read in his father's books. No mention is made of the heroic resistance that had so recently been underway on the island of Malta, and the reader is left with a lingering sense of unjustified mistrust about one character until late in the novel.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Faughs GAA Club", "body": "Faughs GAA Club is a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) hurling and camogie club in Templeogue, Dublin, Ireland. They have won 31 titles.\\n\\nFaughs GAA Club was founded in Easter 1885, \"under the big tree\" in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Its inaugural meeting was held at 4 Gardiner's Row, home of Michael Cusack (now the Dergvale Hotel). The club name, Faughs, is derived from the Irish language slogan, , meaning \"clear the way,\" a battle cry used by ancient Irish warriors.\\n\\nThe first club officers were: \\n\\nWhen the Dublin County Board was formed in 1886, Larry O'Toole was on the committee. At this time Faughs, wearing colours amber and black played both hurling and football, took part in the first Dublin championships in 1887, and were winners of the Dublin Senior Football Championship in 1889. \\n\\nIn January 1891, Faughs merged with the \"Davitts\" who, like Faughs, were mostly \"spirit grocers assistants\". As \"Faughs–Davitts\" in colours amber, black and blue, they won their first Dublin senior hurling championship in 1892, and were beaten by Redmonds of Cork in the All-Ireland final in an unfinished match. The Faughs–Davitts coalition declined after that, as indeed did most clubs at the time due to the Parnell split.\\n\\nIn 1895, a member of the original Faughs club—Pat Cullen, who was destined to lend invaluable aid to the spread of native games in Dublin—revived and reorganised the club with the assistance of Tim Gleeson, Jack Cleary and Tom Hogan, who were also members of the original club. After 1895, Faughs became a hurling-only club and adopted the colours of saffron and green, which it has kept to the present day. \\n\\nProminent officers elected then were:\\n\\nThese men held office for many years, laying the foundation and success of the club and spreading the popularity of the national pastime in the city. \\n\\nThe early years of the 20th century proved to be very successful for the club, which won the first four senior championships–four in a row, 1900–1904—and another five before 1920. Big names during this period were Jack and Jimmy Cleary, Danny McCormack, Andy Harty, and Jack and Will Connolly. Playing at fullback on the team that won the 1914 and 1915 championships was Harry Boland, famous for his part in the 1916 Rising and War of Independence. He was later killed in the Civil War. \\n\\nThe four in a row was achieved again in 1920–1923. The best year of all was 1920 when they won the Senior Championship and League, Intermediate Championship and League. The team led by Bob Mockler, the greatest midfielder of his time, captured the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship title beating Cork in the final by six points. The final score was 4-9 to 4-3. \\n\\nIncluded in this team were Jim \"Builder\" Walsh, the only man selected on all three Tailteann Games Ireland teams, Tommy Moore, Mick Neville, Martin Hayes, Tom Hayes, Jimmy Cleary, Ned Tobin, Bob Doherty and John Joe Callanan who would later captain Tipperary to beat Dublin in the 1930 All-Ireland final. \\n\\nThe next great era was from 1939–1952 when eight championships were won including two threes-in-a-row, 1939–1941 and 1944–1946. These teams included many prominent inter-county and inter-provincial players including the gifted and stylish Harry Grey, Ned Wade, Phil Farrell, Mick Butler, Terry Leahy, Mick Gill, Jim Mullane, Martin Quinn, Dan Canniffe, Charlie Downes, Jim Egan, Johnny Callanan, Dan Devitt, Murt O'Brien, Jim Prior, Mick Williams, Tony Herbert, Liam Cashin, Tom Fahy, Jack Sheedy and Tommy Boland. \\n\\nA lean period followed, although winning four senior league titles in the interim, Faughs next senior championship success had to wait until 1970. Then they almost won five championships in a row. They beat St. Vincents in Croke Park to win the 1970 title. In May 1971, after a tremendous but gruelling game, they were unlucky to be beaten by one point by Buffers Alley in the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship. A few days later, they were knocked out of the Dublin championship, again by a single point margin by Craobh Ciaran who went on to win their first Dublin title. \\n\\nFaughs won the next two county championships of 1972 and 1973 and reached the final in 1974, which they lost to Kilmacud Crokes by one point. Helping in these victories were goalkeeper Mick O'Mahony, Paddy Spellman, Eamonn Long, Eamonn Rea, Liam White, Sean White, Mossie Walsh, John Hearne, Sean Buckley, Mick Kennedy, Billy Dwyer, John Conway, Willie Devitt, Colm Muldoon and Pat O'Neill. While still wearing the jersey as a substitute was Timmy Maher, who had played on the Faughs team that won the Dublin Championship in 1952. \\n\\nTwo senior titles came in the 1980s—1986 and 1987 with Joe Cunningham, Jim Lyng, Richie Reid, M. J. Ryan and the Newman brothers, Martin and P.J. Two more came in the 1990s, 1992 and 1999, to bring the grand total of senior championships won to 31. \\n\\nFrom their foundation in 1885 up to 1949, Faughs trained in the Phoenix Park in the Fifteen Acres, Nine Acres, Polo Ground and beside the Hurling Ground or Army Ground, except for a short period in the winter of 1942–3 when they moved to Dolphin Park. From 1949 to 1958, they leased a ground in St. Anne's Estate in Killester, where they erected their own dressing rooms. \\n\\nFollowing serious vandalism of these, they moved back to the Phoenix Park to the original Fifteen Acres of the 1885 period. In 1972, training moved to Terenure College where the team training facilities included the luxury of showers, etc., until finally in 1981, they moved to the ground at Tymon North, Templeogue. \\n\\nIn the early days, club meetings took place at various venues, including Pat Cullen's premises at 27 Upper Ormond Quay, where Dublin County Board and Leinster Council meetings were also held. Later, and for many years, Tommy Moore's premises in Cathedral Street was the home of Faughs. It was also the meeting place for all Gaels from all over Ireland attending matches at Croke Park. \\n\\nFrom the early 1960s, Stephen Bourke's premises at 25 Wexford Street became the new home of Faughs. It was here that the plans were laid to build the clubhouse at Tymon North, Templeogue, which was officially opened by Dr. Patrick Hillery, President of Ireland on 30 November 1986. \\n\\nFrom the earliest days, Faughs' contribution to Dublin GAA games has been considerable. Pat Cullen was a member of Dublin Coounty Board from 1887, and its Treasurer from 1902, a founder member of the Dublin Hurling League 1901 and donor of the Cullen Cup to the League winners. He is believed to have helped financially in the purchase of Croke Park by the G.A.A. \\n\\nHarry Boland, who was prominent in the 1916 Rising and War of Independence, won senior championships with Faughs in 1914 and 1915. He was Chairman of Dublin County Board from 1911–1916. \\n\\nAndy Harty, who won nine championships with Faughs, was County Board Chairman in 1916–1925. \\n\\nJim (Builder) Walsh won three All-Irelands with Dublin, and was the only player selected on all three Tailteann Games (Ireland) teams. He was Chairman of Dublin County Board during 1929–1930. \\n\\nPat Farrell, hurling correspondent under the pen-name \"P.F.\" for several decades with the Evening Herald, was chairman of the Dublin Junior Board in 1934–1935, and was also a senior hurling selector for many years. \\n\\nFaughs Dublin teams won eight Leinster Championships. Bob Mockler captained Faughs to win the 1920 All-Ireland for Dublin. Dublin last All-Ireland win in 1938 included Faughs players Mick Butler, Phil Farrell, Mick Gill, Harry Grey and Charlie Downs. Jim Prior captained Dublin in the 1952 All-Ireland while Mick Kennedy, who got the first score on RTÉ, represented Faughs in Dublin's last All-Ireland final appearance in 1961. Mick Kennedy was a selector during Lar Foley's term as manager in the 1990s. \\n\\nThe club's chairmen from 1895 were Pat Cullen, Tim Gleeson, Tom Hogan, Bob Mockler, Tommy Moore (1929–1969), Mick Clayton (1969–1985), Eamonn Rea (1985–2001), and current chairman, Gus Brennan.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fauna of Africa", "body": "Fauna of Africa, in its broader sense, is all the animal living on the Africa continent and its surrounding seas and islands. The more characteristic African fauna is found in the Afrotropical ecoregion - formerly called Ethiopian (the Sub-Saharan Africa). Lying almost entirely within the tropics, and equally to north and south of the equator creates favourable conditions for rich wildlife.right\\n\\nWhereas the earliest traces of life in fossil record of Africa date to the earliest times, the formation of African fauna as we know it today, began with the splitting up of the Gondwana supercontinent in the mid-Mesozoic era. rightAfter that, four to six faunal assemblages, the so called African Faunal Strata (AFSs) can be distinguished. The isolation of Africa was broken intermittently by discontinuous \"filter routes\" that linked it to some other Gondwanan continents (Madagascar, South America, and perhaps India), but mainly to Laurasia. Interchanges with Gondwana were rare and mainly \"out-of-Africa\" dispersals, whereas interchanges with Laurasia were numerous and bidirectional, although mainly from Laurasia to Africa. Despite these connections, isolation resulted in remarkable absences, poor diversity, and emergence of endemic taxa in Africa. Madagascar separated from continental Africa during the break-up of Gondwanaland early in the Cretaceous, but was probably connected to the mainland again in the Eocene.\\n\\nThe first Neogene faunal interchange took place in the Middle Miocene (the introduction of Myocricetodontinae, Democricetodontinae, and Dendromurinae).A major terrestrial faunal exchange between North Africa and Europe began at about 6.1 Ma, some 0.4 Myr before the beginning of the Messinian salinity crisis(for example introduction of Murinae, immigrants from southern Asia)\\n\\nDuring the early Tertiary, Africa was covered by a vast evergreen forest inhabited by an endemic forest fauna with many types common to southern Asia. In the Pliocene the climate became dry and most of the forest was destroyed, the forest animals taking refuge in the remaining forest islands. At the same time a broad land-bridge connected Africa with Asia and there was a great invasion of animals of the steppe fauna into Africa. At the beginning of the Pleistocene a moist period set in and much of the forest was renewed while the grassland fauna was divided and isolated, as the forest fauna had previously been. The present forest fauna is therefore of double origin, partly descended from the endemic fauna and partly from steppe forms that adapted themselves to forest life, while the present savanna fauna is similarly explained. The isolation in past times has resulted in the presence of closely related subspecies in widely separated regions Africa, where humans originated, shows much less evidence of loss in the Pleistocene megafauna extinction, perhaps because co-evolution of large animals alongside early humans provided enough time for them to develop effective defenses. Its situation in the tropics spared it also from Pleistocene glaciations and the climate has not changed much\\n\\nThere are large gaps in our knowledge of African invertebrates. East Africa has a rich coral fauna with about 400 known species. More than 400 species of Echinoderms and 500 species of Bryozoa live there too, as well as one Cubozoa species (Carybdea alata). Of Nematode, the Onchocerca volvulus, Necator americanus, Wuchereria bancrofti and Dracunculus medinensis are human parasites. Some of important plant-parasitic nematodes of crops include Meloidogyne, Pratylenchus, Hirschmanniella, Radopholus, Scutellonema and Helicotylenchus. Of the few Onychophora Peripatus, Peripatopsis and Opisthopatus live in Africa. thumb diversity of freshwater mollusks is found in East African lakes. Of marine snails, less diversity is present in Atlantic coast, more in tropical Western Indian Ocean region (over 3000 species of gastropods with 81 endemic species). Cowry shells have been used as a money by native Africans. The land snail fauna is especially rich in Afromontane regions, and there are some endemic families in Africa (e.g. Achatinidae, Chlamydephoridae) but other tropical families are common too (Charopidae, Streptaxidae, Cyclophoridae, Subulinidae, Rhytididae).156 tardigrade species have been found, and about 8000 species of arachnid. The African millipede Archispirostreptus gigas is one of the largest in the world. 20 genera of freshwater crab are present.\\n\\nThe soil animal communities tropical Africa are poorly known. A few ecological studies have been undertaken on macrofauna, mainly in West Africa. Earthworms are being extensively studied in West and South Africa.\\n\\nthumbApproximately 100 000 species of insects have been described from sub-Saharan Africa, but there are very few overviews of the fauna as a whole (it has been estimated that the African insects make up about 10-20% of the global insect species richness, and about 15% of new species descriptions come from Afrotropics). The only endemic African insect order is Mantophasmatodea.\\n\\nAbout 875 African species of dragonflies have been recorded.The migratory locust and desert locust have been serious threats to African economies and human welfare.Africa has the biggest number of termite genera of all continents, and over 1,000 termite species.Of Diptera, the number of described African species is about 17,000. Natalimyzidae, a new family of acalyptrate flies has been recently described from South Africa. Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti and Tsetse fly are important vectors of diseases. thumb 1600 species of bees and 2000 species of ant among other Hymenoptera are known from Africa.There live also 3,607 species of butterflies, being the best known group of insects. The caterpillars of mopani moth are part of the South African cuisine. Among the numerous species of African beetles are the famous sacred scarab dung beetle and enormous Goliath beetles.\\n\\nthumbAfrica is the richest continent of freshwater fish, with about 3000 species. The East African Great Lakes (Victoria, Malawi, and Tanganyika) are the center of biodiversity of many fish, especially cichlid (they harbor more than two-thirds of the estimated 2000 species in the family). The West African coastal rivers region covers only a fraction of West Africa, but harbours 322 of West African’s fish species, with 247 restricted to this area and 129 restricted even to smaller ranges. The central rivers fauna comprises 194 fish species, with 119 endemics and only 33 restricted to small areas. The marine diversity is greatest near the Indian Ocean shore with about 2000 species.\\n\\nCharacteristic to African fauna are Perciformes (Lates, tilapia, Dichistiidae, Anabantidae, Mudskipper, Parachanna, Acentrogobius, Croilia, Glossogobius, Hemichromis, Nanochromis, Oligolepis, Oreochromis, Redigobius, Sarotherodon, Stenogobius and others), Gonorhynchiformes (Kneriidae, Phractolaemidae), some lungfishes (Protopterus), many Characiformes (Distichodontidae, Hepsetidae, Citharinidae, Alestiidae), Osteoglossiformes (African knifefish, Gymnarchidae, Mormyridae, Pantodontidae), Siluriformes (Amphiliidae, Anchariidae, Ariidae, Austroglanididae, Clariidae, Claroteidae, Malapteruridae, Mochokidae, Schilbeidae), Osmeriformes (Galaxiidae), Cyprinodontiformes (Aplocheilidae, Poeciliidae) and Cypriniformes (Labeobarbus, Pseudobarbus, Tanakia and others).\\n\\nEndemic to Africa are the families Arthroleptidae, Astylosternidae, Heleophrynidae, Hemisotidae, Hyperoliidae, Petropedetidae, Mantellidae. Also widespread are Bufonidae (Bufo, Churamiti, Capensibufo, Mertensophryne,Nectophryne,Nectophrynoides,Schismaderma, Stephopaedes, Werneria, Wolterstorffina), Microhylidae (Breviceps, Callulina, Probreviceps, Cophylinae,Dyscophus, Melanobatrachinae, Scaphiophryninae), Rhacophoridae (Chiromantis), Ranidae (Afrana, Amietia, Amnirana, Aubria, Conraua, Hildebrandtia, Lanzarana, Ptychadena, Strongylopus, Tomopterna) and Pipidae (Hymenochirus, Pseudhymenochirus, Xenopus).The 2002–2004 ‘Global Amphibian Assessment’ by IUCN, Conservation International and NatureServe revealed that for only about 50% of the Afrotropical amphibians, there is least concern about their conservation status; approximately 130 species are endangered, about one-fourth of which are at a critical stage. Almost all of the amphibians of Madagascar (238 species) are endemic to that region. The west African Goliath frog is the largest frog species in the world.\\n\\nthumbThe most species rich place of the chameleon is Madagascar. Snakes found in Africa include atractaspidids, elapids (cobras, Aspidelaps, Boulengerina, Dendroaspis, Elapsoidea, Hemachatus, Homoroselaps and Paranaja), causines, viperines (Adenorhinos, Atheris, Bitis, Cerastes, Echis, Macrovipera, Montatheris, Proatheris, Vipera), colubrid (Dendrolycus, Dispholidus, Gonionotophis, Grayia, Hormonotus, Lamprophis, Psammophis, Leioheterodon, Madagascarophis, Poecilopholis, Dasypeltis etc.), the pythonids (Python), typhlopids (Typhlops) and leptotyphlopids (Leptotyphlops, Rhinoleptus).\\n\\nOf the lizards, many species of gecko (Day gecko, Afroedura, Afrogecko, Colopus, Pachydactylus, Hemidactylus, Narudasia, Paroedura, Pristurus, Quedenfeldtia, Rhoptropus, Tropiocolotes, Uroplatus), Cordylidae, as well as Lacertidae (Nucras, Lacerta, Mesalina, Acanthodactylus, Pedioplanis), Agamas, skink plated lizard and some Monitor lizard are common. There are 12 genera and 58 species of African Amphisbaenia (e.g. Chirindia, Zygaspis, Monopeltis, Dalophia).\\n\\nSeveral genera of tortoise (Kinixys, Pelusios, Psammobates, Geochelone, Homopus, Chersina), turtles (Pelomedusidae, Cyclanorbis, Cycloderma, Erymnochelys), and three species of crocodile (the Nile crocodile, Slender-snouted Crocodile and Dwarf Crocodile) are also present.\\n\\nthumb live (temporarily or permanently) more than 2600 bird species in Africa (about 1500 of them Passerine). Some 114 of them are threatened species.The Afrotropic has various endemic bird families, including ostrich (Struthionidae), Mesite, sunbird, Secretary bird (Sagittariidae), guineafowl (Numididae), and mousebird (Coliidae). Also, several families of passerines are limited to the Afrotropics. These include rock-jumper (Chaetopidae), Bushshrike (Malaconotidae), Wattle-eye, (Platysteiridae) and rockfowl (Picathartidae). Other common birds include parrot (Lovebird, Poicephalus, Psittacus), various cranes (Crowned Cranes, Blue Crane, Wattled Crane), stork (Slaty Egret, Black Heron, Marabous, Abdim's Stork, Shoebill), bustard (Kori Bustard, Neotis, Eupodotis, Lissotis), sandgrouse (Pterocles), Coraciiformes (Bee-eater, Hornbills, Ceratogymna), Phasianid (Francolin, Congo Peafowl, Blue Quail, Harlequin Quail, Stone Partridge, Madagascar Partridge). The woodpeckers and allies include Honeyguide, African barbet, African Piculet, Ground Woodpecker, Dendropicos and Campethera. The birds of prey include the Buzzard, Harrier, Old World vulture, Bateleur, Circaetus, Melierax and others. Trogon are represented by one genus (Apaloderma). African Penguin is the only penguin species. Madagascar was once home to the now extinct Elephant Bird.\\n\\nAfrica is home to numerous songbird (Pipit, Oriole, Antpecker, Brubru, Cisticola, Negrofinch, Oliveback, Pytilia, Green-backed Twinspot, Crimson-wing, Seedcracker, Bluebill, Firefinch, Waxbills, Amandava, Quailfinch, Munia, Weavers, Tit-hylia, Amadina, Anthoscopus, Mirafra, Hypargos, Eremomela, Euschistospiza, Erythrocercus, Malimbus, Pitta, Uraeginthus, Pied Crow, White-necked Raven, Thick-billed Raven, Cape Crow and others). The Red-billed Quelea is the most abundant bird species in the world.\\n\\nOf the 589 species of birds (excluding seabirds) that breed in the Palaearctic (temperate Europe and Asia), 40% spend the winter elsewhere. Of those species that leave for the winter, 98% travel south to Africa.See also: Endemic birds of western and central Africa, Endemic birds of southern Africa.\\n\\nMore than 1100 mammal species live in Africa.Africa has three endemic orders of mammals, the Tubulidentata (aardvark), Afrosoricida (tenrec and golden mole), and Macroscelidea (elephant shrew). The current research of mammalian phylogeny has proposed an Afrotheria clade (including the exclusively African orders). The East-African plains are well known for their diversity of large mammals. \\n\\nAfrican Soricomorpha include the Myosoricinae and Crocidurinae subfamilies. Hedgehog include Desert Hedgehog, Atelerix and others.

{"title": "Faustino Sainz Muñoz", "body": "Faustino Sainz Muñoz (born 5 June 1937) is a Spanish prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the Nuncio to Great Britain from 2004 until December 2010, having been appointed by Pope John Paul II in 2004.\\n\\nBorn in Almadén, Ciudad Real Province, Faustino Sainz Muñoz was ordained to the priesthood on 19 December 1964. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1970, serving in the Pontifical Representations in Senegal and Scandinavia, and then in the Council of Public Affairs of the Church of the Vatican Secretariat of State. As a junior diplomat in Finland, he was dispatched as part of the Holy See's delegation to the preparatory talks of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in 1975; the delegation diligently ensured that religious freedom was included in the Helsinki Accords. Upon his returning to the Vatican that same year, Sainz was made the Holy See’s liaison with Poland, Hungary, and later the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\\n\\nHe traveled to Latin America in 1978, where he accompanied Antonio Cardinal Samoré in successfully averting war between Chile and Argentina over the Beagle conflict. Sainz, who accompanied Pope John Paul on his visit to his native Poland in June 1979, describes the crowd's applause during the Pope's homily at a Mass on Victory Square in Warsaw as “an image that [he] cannot forget...it was the beginning of the end of Communism in Poland”.\\n\\nOn 29 October 1988, he was appointed Pro-Nuncio to Cuba and Titular Archbishop of Novaliciana by John Paul. Sainz received his episcopal consecration on the following 18 December (a day before his twenty-fourth anniversary of priestly ordination) from Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, with Ángel Cardinal Suquía Goicoechea and Archbishop Maximino Romero de Lema serving as co-consecrators. While in this post, he held many discussions with Fidel Castro about episcopal cooperation in improving the position of the Cuban Church and the welfare of the Cuban people.\\n\\nSainz was later named Nuncio to the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 7 October 1992 (offering the nunciature as a place of relief and refuge to those persecuted during the Rwandan Genocide), to the European Community on 21 January 1999, and to Great Britain on 11 December 2004. The Archbishop believes in obedience to Church doctrine, once stating, \"Thinking changes, society changes, fashion changes. But the central concept of human dignity from conception does not change\". Despite this, he has shown himself a keen supporter of the Catholic weekly, The Tablet, often criticised for its left-leaning, anti-Roman views.\\n\\nOn 16 May 2010 Archbishop Faustino Sainz Muñoz suffered a mild stroke. He is receiving medical care in hospital in Spain. Despite this, the Archbishop was present when Pope Benedict XVI arrived at Edinburgh airport, being the first to welcome him, and being present throughout the papal visit which occurred on September 2010. On 12 November 2010 Archbishop Faustino Sainz Muñoz has announced his retirement as papal nuncio to Great Britain during thanksgiving Mass for the papal visit at St Mary’s Cathedral in Edinburgh. On 2 December 2010 a Mass of thanksgiving was celebrated at Westminster Cathedral, which marked the end of his role as papal nuncio to Great Britain.\\n\\n"}

In compliance with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 Revised, the FAC is in charge of receiving, processing and distributing to U.S. Federal agencies the Single Audit reporting packages of thousands of recipients of Federal assistance. OMB designated the U.S. Census Bureau to serve as the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. It operates and maintains an online database of Single Audit information submitted by recipients going back to 1997.\\n\\nEach year the Federal government provides over $500 billion dollars in Federal assistance to all kinds of recipients, including States, cities and counties, non-profit organization, universities and individuals. In order to monitor the fair, legal, and correct use of these funds, the government created the Single Audit. This annual audit applies to any state and local government, non-profit entity, or Indian tribe that expended $500,000 or more of Federal assistance within one fiscal year. The Single Audit incorporates the auditing of the use and management of the Federal funds to verify if it complied with the laws and regulations applicable to that specific assistance. \\n\\nWhen the Single Audit is complete, the recipient must send the auditor's report and other required documentation to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC). The FAC then enters the results of the audit into its electronic database and stores the data. The information included in the database is limited to the recipient’s basic information (including contact information, addresses, etc.), the auditor’s basic information, the types of Federal assistance received and audited (also known as Federal programs), and the type of auditor's findings, if any, detected in the Single Audit (e.g. situations of noncompliance, illegal acts, etc.). The online database can be accessed by Federal agencies and the general public to learn about a specific recipient’s Single Audit results, although it is limited to the information previously mentioned. Additionally, Federal agencies may request to see a recipient’s Single Audit reporting package to obtain more specific and detailed information about the audit results and about any findings encountered.\\n\\nThe Federal Audit Clearinghouse has four basic operating objectives:\\n\\nThe Data Collection Form (Form SF-SAC) is a worksheet which recipients must complete online and include with the Single Audit reporting packages sent to the FAC. The worksheet is divided into three parts, and is an important tool for the FAC because it summarizes the entire Single Audit results of a recipient in a few pages, which allows for easier and faster sorting and categorizing. The Data Collection Form is created online and a physical copy is sent with the Single Audit reporting package to the FAC, certified by both the recipient and the auditor. Beginning with the submission of 2008 audit submissions, the entire audit package must be submitted electronically.\\n\\nThe first part of the data collection form requires the recipient and its auditor to provide basic contact information, including the person occupying the highest management position of the recipient (e.g. Governor, Mayor, Chancellor, President, CEO, etc.) and the auditor (usually a partner), addresses, telephone numbers, Employer Identification Number (EIN), among other info. \\n\\nThe second part includes information about the Single Audit itself. The auditor must indicate the final results of the audit, provide information on several risk assessment performed on the recipient during the Single Audit, specify which federal assistance programs were actually audited, and indicate whether any findings were noted during the Single Audit, among other information.\\n\\nThe third and final part requires the recipient to list all the federal assistance received by program name, and include basic information about each program including the amount of assistance used, the type of assistance, whether or not any findings were encountered for each program, and, if encountered, the type of compliance requirement that the finding applies to.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Federal Building, United States Post Office and Courthouse (Hilo, Hawaii)", "body": "The Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Hilo, Hawaii is former a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. Completed in 1917 and expanded in the 1930s, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\\n\\nPrior to the annexation of the islands by the United States in 1898, Hilo was a thriving educational and commercial center on Hawaii, the largest of the Hawaiian Islands. Flourishing agricultural enterprises were served by railroads and harbors that facilitated trade with both the continental United States and East Asia. Postal services in Hilo commenced in 1858. When the Hawaiian Islands became a territory of the United States in 1900, officials wanted to expand postal and court facilities for the second-largest city in the territory. By 1913, the Hilo Board of Trade and the territory's governmental representative secured US$200,000 for a federal building.\\n\\nNew York architect Henry Whitfield designed the new building in 1915. Whitfield, who was the brother-in-law of Andrew Carnegie, had just completed the design for the Honolulu Carnegie Library. Whitfield designed the building in the Mediterranean Renaissance Revival style, which blends traditional classical architecture with features more suited to a tropical climate. The building was one of the first in Hawaii constructed using reinforced concrete, a technology that was common on the mainland. Construction was completed and the building occupied in 1917. It originally functioned as a courthouse, post office, and custom house. Other tenants included the Immigration Bureau, Agricultural Extension Service, Weather Bureau, and Internal Revenue Service.\\n\\nBy the 1930s, tenants required more space and two wings were added to the building between 1936 and 1938. Louis A. Simon, supervising architect of the US Treasury, designed the wings in a style compatible with that of the original building. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on October 1, 1974 as site 74000708. In 1978, most postal functions moved to a new location, and the following year the Third Circuit Court vacated the third floor, which was converted into offices.\\n\\nThe structure is located on the northern edge of downtown bounded by Waianuenue Avenue, Wailuku Drive, and Kinoole and Kekaulike streets at 154 Waianuenue Avenue (Route 200), , on Kalakaua Park square. Across the square is the historic former District Courthouse and Police Station.\\n\\nWhitfield's design blends classically inspired forms and motifs with features that are suitable for the warm Hawaiian climate. It is particularly noteworthy for its use of reinforced concrete, and it is one of the earliest buildings in the area to be constructed of permanent materials.\\n\\nThe reinforced concrete building is covered with painted stucco. The original building was rectangular, and the wing additions extend forward from the facade to form a U-shape. The facade is organized around a central courtyard. The building is three stories in height with a penthouse. Open-air loggia divided into three distinct levels face the courtyard and provide occupants with pleasant views and circulating air currents. The loggias also function as exterior corridors and provide primary circulation for occupants. One of the building's most appealing features is a two-story colonnade supported by monumental Tuscan column. The colonnade faces the courtyard and supports the loggia on the first and second stories, while simple, square piers support the third-level loggia. Wrought-iron baluster are located on the first and second floors on portions of the colonnade. Decorative elements within the courtyard, including colorful mosaic tiles and urns, emphasize the Mediterranean Renaissance Revival style of the building, which blends classical and exotic motifs. Wrought-iron light fixtures are located on the building, and a wrought-iron grille with a gilded eagle tops the entrance to the postal lobby.\\n\\nThe exterior is divided into horizontal zones by water table and stringcourse, a feature common to Renaissance Revival architecture.

{"title": "Federal Street Church (Boston)", "body": "thumb\\n\\nThe Federal Street Church (est.1729) was a congregational unitarian church in Boston, Massachusetts. Organized in 1727, the presbyterian congregation changed in 1786 to Congregationalism, then adopted the liberal theology of its fifth Senior Minister, William Ellery Channing. For most of the 18th-century the church was known as the Long Lane Meeting-House. In 1788 state leaders met in the relatively spacious building to determine Massachusetts' ratification of the United States Constitution. Thereafter the church re-named itself the Federal Street Church in honor of the event. In 1803, it called William Ellery Channing as its minister who defined \"Unitarian Christianity\" and launched the Unitarian movement, making the Federal Street Church one of the first to define itself as Unitarian.\\n\\nThe congregation began as a group of Scots-Irish Calvinists gathered in a converted barn on Long Lane in Boston on November 15, 1729. The inhospitable residents of Boston dubbed them derogatorily as “The Church of the Presbyterian Strangers,” and the name stuck. \"Their first house of worship was a barn, which sufficed until they were able, in 1744, to build a neat wooden edifice. Governor Hancock presented the bell and vane which had belonged to the Old Brattle Street Meeting-house.\" \"The Presbyterian was exchanged for the Congregational form of government, by a unanimous vote, August 6, 1786.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\n\"It was the Federal St. Church where the Massachusetts convention congregated, when debating and deciding on the confederating constitution of the United States in 1788; and from that time, the name of the street was changed from Long Lane to Federal Street.\"\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nWilliam Ellery Channing, often known as the Father of American Unitarianism, served as Senior Minister at the Federal Street Church from 1803 to 1842. Under his leadership the congregation prospered. To accommodate the crowds that Channing drew, the third meeting house, designed by the noted architect Charles Bulfinch, was built in 1809 on the Federal Street site. At the time, Bulfinch's design received mixed reviews. \"The lightest and most graceful steeple in Boston is in Federal Street, of the Gothic order. We believe the Federal Street Church is the first attempt at this style of architecture in Massachusetts, and one of the first in the United States. It has great faults, and, indeed, few merits except the steeple.\"\\n\\nIn 1819 Channing delivered “The Baltimore Sermon,” which defined the new Unitarian theology for the burgeoning Unitarian movement. Although Channing originally resisted formation of a new denomination, under the direction of his associate and later successor, Ezra Stiles Gannett, the move toward separation from the Congregationalists began. The American Unitarian Association was formed in the vestry of the Federal Street Church on May 25, 1825, with Channing offering well wishes and Gannett serving as Secretary. Through brilliant preaching, writing, and publishing, Channing made many contributions to the moral thought of his day, none more important than his clearly reasoned though highly delayed statement against slavery, which became a national best seller, even as it alienated some of his wealthy parishioners who opposed abolition. In 1903, on the 100th anniversary of his installation as minister, a statue of Channing was placed in the Boston Public Garden.\\n\\nBy mid-century overcrowding in the neighborhood \"necessitated a change of location, and in 1859 the church sold their property and built the elegant brown stone building on the corner of Arlington and Boylston Streets, which was dedicated in December, 1861. The congregation continues today as the Arlington Street Church in Back Bay.\\n\\nright\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Federal funds rate", "body": "In the United States, the federal funds rate is the interest rate at which private depository institutions (mostly banks) lend balances (federal funds) at the Federal Reserve to other depository institutions, usually overnight. It is the interest rate banks charge each other for loans. \\n\\nThe interest rate that the borrowing bank pays to the lending bank to borrow the funds is negotiated between the two banks, and the weighted average of this rate across all such transactions is the federal funds effective rate.\\n\\nThe federal funds target rate is determined by a meeting of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee which normally occurs eight times a year about seven weeks apart. The committee may also hold additional meetings and implement target rate changes outside of its normal schedule.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve uses Open market operations to influence the supply of money in the U.S. economy to make the federal funds effective rate follow the federal funds target rate. The target value is known as the neutral federal funds rate. At this rate, growth rate of real GDP is stable in relation to Long Run Aggregate Supply at the expected inflation rate.\\n\\nU.S. bank and thrift institution are obligated by law to maintain certain levels of reserves, either as reserves with the Fed or as vault cash. The level of these reserves is determined by the outstanding assets and liabilities of each depository institution, as well as by the Fed itself, but is typically 10% of the total value of the bank's demand account (depending on bank size). In the range of $9.3 million to $43.9 million, for transaction deposit (checking account, NOW, and other deposits that can be used to make payments) the reserve requirement in 2007-2008 was 3 percent of the end-of-the-day daily average amount held over a two-week period. Transaction deposits over $43.9 million held at the same depository institution carried a 10 percent reserve requirement.\\n\\nFor example, assume a particular U.S. depository institution, in the normal course of business, issues a loan. This dispenses money and decreases the ratio of bank reserves to money loaned. If its reserve ratio drops below the legally required minimum, it must add to its reserves to remain compliant with Federal Reserve regulations. The bank can borrow the requisite funds from another bank that has a surplus in its account with the Fed. The interest rate that the borrowing bank pays to the lending bank to borrow the funds is negotiated between the two banks, and the weighted average of this rate across all such transactions is the federal funds effective rate.\\n\\nThe nominal rate is a target set by the governors of the Federal Reserve, which they enforce primarily by open market operations. That nominal rate is almost always what is meant by the media referring to the Federal Reserve \"changing interest rates.\" The actual Fed funds rate generally lies within a range of that target rate, as the Federal Reserve cannot set an exact value through open market operations.\\n\\nAnother way banks can borrow funds to keep up their required reserves is by taking a loan from the Federal Reserve itself at the discount window. These loans are subject to audit by the Fed, and the discount rate is usually higher than the federal funds rate. Confusion between these two kinds of loans often leads to confusion between the federal funds rate and the discount rate. Another difference is that while the Fed cannot set an exact federal funds rate, it can set a specific discount rate.\\n\\nThe federal funds rate target is decided by the governors at Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. The FOMC members will either increase, decrease, or leave the rate unchanged depending on the meeting's agenda and the economic conditions of the U.S. It is possible to infer the market expectations of the FOMC decisions at future meetings from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Fed Funds futures contract, and these probabilities are widely reported in the financial media.\\n\\nInterbank borrowing is essentially a way for banks to quickly raise capital. For example, a bank may want to finance a major industrial effort but not have the time to wait for deposits or interest (on loan payments) to come in. In such cases the bank will quickly raise this amount from other banks at an interest rate equal to or higher than the Federal funds rate.\\n\\nRaising the federal funds rate will dissuade banks from taking out such inter-bank loans, which in turn will make cash that much harder to procure. Conversely, dropping the interest rates will encourage banks to borrow money and therefore invest more freely. Thus this interest rate acts as a regulatory tool to control how freely the US economy operates.\\n\\nBy setting a higher discount rate the Federal Bank discourages banks from requisitioning funds from the Federal Bank, yet positions itself as a source of last resort.\\n\\nThough the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the federal funds rate are concerned with the same action, i.e. interbank loans, they are distinct from one another, as following:\\n\\nConsidering the wide impact a change in the federal funds rate can have on the value of the dollar and the amount of lending going to new economic activity, the Federal Reserve is closely watched by the market. The prices of Option contracts on fed funds futures (traded on the Chicago Board of Trade) can be used to infer the market's expectations of future Fed policy changes. One set of such implied probabilities is published by the Cleveland Fed.\\n\\nAs of December 16, 2008, the most recent change the FOMC has made to the funds target rate is a 75 - 100 basis point cut from 1.0% to a range of zero to 0.25%. According to Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, one reason for this unprecedented move of having a range, rather than a specific rate, was because a rate of 0% could have had problematic implications for money market funds, whose fees could then outpace yields. This followed the 50 basis point cut on October 29, 2008, and the unusually large 75 basis point cut made during a special January 22, 2008 meeting, as well as a 50 basis point cut on January 30, 2008, a 75 basis point cut on March 18, 2008, and a 50 basis point cut on October 8, 2008.\\n\\ncenter\\n\\nWhen the Federal Open Market Committee wishes to reduce interest rates they will increase the supply of money by buying government securities. When additional supply is added and everything else remains constant, price normally falls. The price here is the interest rate (cost of money) and specifically refers to the Federal Funds Rate. Conversely, when the Committee wishes to increase the Fed Funds Rate, they will instruct the Desk Manager to sell government securities, thereby taking the money they earn on the proceeds of those sales out of circulation and reducing the money supply. When supply is taken away and everything else remains constant, price (or in this case interest rates) will normally rise.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve has responded to a potential slow-down by lowering the target federal funds rate during recessions and other periods of lower growth. In fact, the Committee's lowering has recently predated recessions, in order to stimulate the economy and cushion the fall. Reducing the Fed Funds Rate makes money cheaper, allowing an influx of credit in to the economy through all types of loans.\\n\\nThe charts linked below show the relation between S&P 500 and interest rates.\\n\\nBill Gross of Pimco has suggested that in the past 15 years, every time the fed funds rate was higher than the nominal GDP growth rate, assets such as stocks and/or housing always fell. He even suggested that the best way to price the fed funds rate would be 100 basis points below the nominal GDP growth rate.\\n\\n"}

Indeed twenty members were needed to form a group in the Chamber. The group acted as a close ally of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.\\n\\nFollowing the decision of Umberto Bossi, leader of Lega Nord, to bring down Berlusconi I Cabinet on 22 December, many Leghisti who wanted to continue that alliance joined the party. These included Franco Rocchetta (founder and long-standing leader of Liga Veneta), Marilena Marin (secretary of Liga Veneta from 1984 to 1994), Lucio Malan, Furio Gubetti and Gualberto Niccolini (President of Lega Nord Toscana from 1988). At the point of its maximum strength, after the merger of the Federalist Italian League (LIF) on 20 December, another splinter group of Lega Nord, FLD had more than 50 MPs.\\n\\nIn the 1996 general election, when Lega Nord, despite the several splits had its best result ever (10.1% nationally), none of the ex-Leghisti of FLD, but Luigi Negri, who came from LIF, was re-elected and the party was merged into Forza Italia. Anyway, in the 2001 general election, both Lucio Malan and Furio Gubetti were elected to the Senate and since then Malan is one of the leaders of Forza Italia in Piedmont.\\n\\n"}

The two news agencies decided to join forces under the Federated Press banner, with Costello holding down the post of Managing Editor of the Service and Lochner acting as Business Manager.

{"title": "Federico Errázuriz Echaurren", "body": "Federico Errázuriz Echaurren (November 16, 1850 - July 12, 1901) was a Chile political figure. Born in Santiago, he served as President of Chile between 1896 and his death in 1901. Federico Errázuriz was of Basque descent.\\n\\nHe was born in Santiago, the first son of former president Federico Errázuriz Zañartu and of First Lady Eulogia Echaurren García-Huidobro. Errázuriz studied at the Padres Franceses, the Instituto Nacional and the Universidad de Chile, where he graduated as a lawyer on March 26, 1873. In 1875 he married Gertrudis Echenique, and together they had two children: Federico and Elena. After the end of his studies, they moved to the hacienda of El Huique, in the province of Colchagua, which he would continue to manage until his death.\\n\\nErrázuriz Echaurren joined the Liberal party and started his political life in 1876, when he was elected as a deputy for Constitución. He was reelected in 1879 and was characterized as a centrist politician. He did not participate in the campaigns of the War of the Pacific, preferring instead to remain in his hacienda, but during the religious controversies between Church and State under President Domingo Santa María, he joined the conservative forces. In August, 1890, President José Manuel Balmaceda named him Minister of War and Navy, under the so-called conciliation cabinet of Belisario Prats; but when Prats resigned his position, so did Errázuriz, and both joined the opposition. In 1891 he was one of the signatories of the Act of Deposition of Presidente Balmaceda. Even so, he did not participate of the Chilean Civil War.\\n\\nAfter the end of the civil war, he was elected deputy for Cauquenes and Constitución (1891–1894). His ill-health forced him to travel to Germany, in search of specialists. During a year and a half, he travelled through Europe, even visiting Pope Leo XIII. He returned to Chile and in 1894 was elected Senator for Maule and designed Minister of Justice and Public Instruction, under President Jorge Montt.\\n\\nthumb a very contested election, Errázuriz Echaurren was elected President and assumed power on September 18, 1896. He took over his office at the age of 46, but by then he already was showing the symptoms of the illness that was going to kill him before the end of his mandate. Both his supporters and the opposition considered him a man of great political cunning, but while his supporters saw him as a true patriot, the opposition pictured him as a corrupt politician capable of the worst excesses. These characterizations made his rule difficult from the start, since he had a majority on the Senate but not on the Chamber of Deputies. He received a country where the economic situation had steadily worsened due to the progressive crisis of the nitrate industry and the associated unemployment and social crisis caused by it; while the international relationships with Perú, Bolivia and Argentina were also in a critical state. To counteract the instability he tried to broaden the political consensus of his supporting coalition by forming a cabinet made up of three liberals and three conservatives, with the Liberal Aníbal Zañartu as Minister of the Interior. This seemingly impeccable arrangement only lasted for two months. In what was the norm during the governments of the period, Errázuriz Echaurren went on to have 17 cabinets during his administration.\\n\\nBetween 1896 and 1897, he named Carlos Antúnez as his Minister of the Interior and charged him with guaranteeing free and \"clean\" elections. Antúnez was in charge until after the general election of March, 1897, considered his mission accomplished after and resigned. This elections were greeted with general pleasure, but did not change the political support for the government, so Errázuriz Echaurren had to continue trying to achieve a balance in order to maintain a semblance of political stability. In the course of this search, Errázuriz Echaurren became closer and closer to the Conservative Party, until in 1898 he named Carlos Walker Martínez, president of the Conservatives as Minister of the Interior. Nonetheless, he remained always loyal to the coalition that elected him, and for example never allowed any member of the Radical party into any of his cabinets. Errázuriz's responses to the cabinet crisis, elections and in general to any problem within his administration was always consistent. He never took any decision without first consulting his political basis in congress, and always subordinated himself to the will of the political parties.\\n\\nErrázuriz's administration was characterized by a marked advancement in public education. Under his impulse, several institutions for the formation of health professionals were created, such as the courses for matrons and nurses, the  of Valparaíso (Professional Institute for Girls), the Instituto Comercial of Santiago (Business Institute); and new high schools in Santiago and Iquique. This administration also contributed with new tram systems in Santiago, Valparaíso, San Felipe and San Bernardo. Errázuriz Echaurren contracted the new sewerage system for Santiago, and the water reservoir of Peñuelas, which still provides the water for Valparaíso.\\n\\nHe faced his biggest problems in the area of monetary policy. The much-wanted return to the metallic conversion, of which he was opposed but which was favored by the parliamentary majorities, was shelved due to the threat of a war with Argentina. The delay of the measure (until 1902) caused a public run on the banks, almost collapsing the banking system, and forcing the government to issue and put into circulation paper money.\\n\\nthumbThe biggest problem that the administration had to face was on the international area. Chile and Argentina were on the brink of war, due to long-standing border disputes stemming from the peace treaty of 1881, the situation of the Puna de Atacama (a disputed territory formerly owned by Bolivia and claimed by both countries) and an ongoing naval arms race. President Errázuriz was avowedly pacifist, but at one point both countries actually got to the point were they called their reserve soldiers. The final solution was to submit the problem to an arbitration by the King of England, the adjudication of which was not resolved until 1902, during the administration of Germán Riesco, President Errázuriz's cousin and successor.\\n\\nTo celebrate the decision to arbitrate and avoid war, Presidente Errázuriz and Argentinian President Julio Argentino Roca held an international meeting in the Strait of Magellan. This meeting is known as the Embrace of the Strait () and took place in front of the city of Punta Arenas on February 15, 1899.\\n\\nAs most presidents of the time, he became involved early in the election of his successor. The Liberal-Conservative Coalition that supported him went on to proclaim Germán Riesco, cousin and brother-in-law of President Errázuriz, as their candidate on March 8, 1901. The President responded on a public letter: ...as I have the firm purpose of not intervening in any political campaign and I don't have or want to have any candidate, I am firmly resolved to prevent the participation of any member of this administration in the upcoming elections.\\n\\nErrázuriz's ill-health continued to plague him during all his period. Before his election, he already had had to travel to Germany in 1893 for treatment, and the death of his oldest son from tuberculosis in 1897 weakened him further. On June 11, 1900 he had to delegate his mandate on Elías Fernández, who assumed as Vice President, so he could travel again to seek medical advise. He reassumed his duties on October 11 of the same year, but died suddenly of cerebral thrombosis on July 12, 1901 while in Valparaíso. He was constitutionally replaced by his Minister of the Interior Aníbal Zañartu, who assumed as Vice President for the remainder of his mandate.\\n\\nF\\n\\n"}

She is also one of the most famous current representatives of the Perico Ripiao or Merengue tipico scene, along with artists like Tatico Henriquez, El Ciego de Nagua, El Prodigio, Rafaelito and Raul Roman, Geovanny Polanco, Francisco Ulloa, and others.\\n\\n\"Fefa\", as referred to by her closest friends and relatives, was born in San Ignacio de Sabaneta, Santiago Rodríguez.It's located in the Cibao Region, the birthplace of the merengue and where almost all merengue tipico musicians hail from. Fefita taught herself accordion on her father's squeezebox, and was already playing concerts for people as respected as Petan Trujillo (Dictator Rafael Trujillo's brother), and appearing frequently on television and radio shows, as early as the age of 9.\\n\\nFefita La Grande in 1995 recorded a Cd with Rafelito Roman called Merengues Tipicos Vol.1 in which Rafelito Roman was playing the accordion and Fefita was singing. They played the following songs such as:1.Recuerdo A Ramona2.La Botija3 Yamaza4.Linda Mama5.La Maya Pendia6.Se Murio Mi Padre7.La Magdalena8.Mi Mujer De Oro9.Mañana Me Voy De Aqui10.A Mi Ay Que Llorarme11.Radhames Guerra12.Yo Vivo Mi Vida13.Debajo De La Ceibafefita was born 1933\\n\\nFefita And Rafelito played again together.

Along with the early exponents of \"new\" merengue tipico, such as Tatico Henriquez, Samuelito Almonte, and El Ciego de Nagua, she added conga, saxophone, and electric bass to the tipico ensemble, which was originally composed of three musicians: an accordion (using a diatonic 2-row accordion), a tambora player (\"tamborero\"), and güira player (\"guirero\"). La Mayimba was also the first to bring merengue tipico to Europe audiences.\\n\\nLa Mayimba's success is also partially achieved because of her ability to stay with the times and constantly reinvent her sound with the help of new tipico artists. Performing with the likes of Krisspy and El Prodigio, she continues to appeal to the young.\\n\\nShort biography of Fefita\\n\\nBiography from www.afropop.org\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Felix Kersten", "body": "Felix Kersten (30 September 1898 Yuryev (Dorpat), Imperial Russia [now Tartu, Estonia] – 16 April 1960, Stockholm, Sweden) was before and during World War II the personal masseur of Heinrich Himmler. Kersten used his position to aid people persecuted by Nazi Germany, although whether his actions were as decisive as Kersten claimed in his memoirs is not always verifiable from other sources.\\n\\nKersten was born in a Baltic German family in Estonia when the country was still a part of Imperial Russia. During World War I he fought in the German Army and arrived in Finland in April 1918 with the German forces that intervened in the Finnish Civil War. Kersten served for a while in Suojeluskunta, was granted Finnish citizenship in 1920 and commissioned 2nd Lieutenant (vänrikki) in the Finnish Army in September 1921.\\n\\nKersten began his studies in Helsinki where he studied with the specialist Dr Colander. After two years' study he was awarded his degree in scientific massage. He then left for Berlin where he continued his studies and eventually became Dr Ko's pupil after an encounter at a dinner party. In 1925 Dr Ko told Kersten \"You have learned all I can teach you.\" He then turned his patients over to Kersten and retired.\\n\\nKersten had a number of very influential customers, among them Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands (after 1928) and Benito Mussolini’s son-in-law and Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano. Kersten felt he had to fulfil Heinrich Himmler's request to become his personal masseur. He wrote that he feared for his safety if he refused. Kersten was able to alleviate Himmler’s severe stomach pains with his skills and retained Himmler's trust until the end of the Second World War in 1945.\\n\\nIn his post-war memoirs Kersten takes credit for saving, among others, the whole Dutch people from forced deportation to the Nazi-occupied East. In 1953 the Dutch government nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize on this account. However a later official Dutch investigation concluded that no such plan had ever existed and that some of Kersten's documents were fabricated. The Swedish archives testify that Kersten was intermediary between Himmler and Count Folke Bernadotte in the negotiations that led to the rescue operation 'The White Buses', saving hundreds of Norwegians and Danes from certain death in the last days of the Third Reich. Kersten’s claims of being instrumental in saving Finland’s Jews from German hands may be exaggerated, but the Finnish government did use his services in the hope of influencing Himmler. During the War, Kersten also provided information to the OSS (predecessor of the CIA).\\n\\nTowards the end of the War, Kersten arranged a meeting with Himmler and Norbert Masur, a member of the Swedish branch of the World Jewish Congress, in Harztwalde, a few miles from Ravensbruck concentration camp. As a result Himmler agreed (reluctantly; perhaps in a vain attempt to save himself from accusations of war crimes) to decline Hitler's order to kill the remaining 60,000 Jews left in Nazi concentration camps days before their liberation by the Allies.\\n\\nAfter the War Kersten lived in West Germany and Sweden, taking Swedish citizenship in 1953. Kersten's war memoirs were published in English translation in 1947 and a second edition was published in 1956 (The Kersten memoirs, 1940-1945, London 1956) with an introduction by H. R. Trevor-Roper. In December 1945 the World Jewish Congress presented Kersten with a letter thanking him for helping to save Jewish concentration-camp victims.\\n\\nFelix Kersten is heavily parodied in the Woody Allen book Getting Even, in the chapter entitled \"The Schmeed Memoirs\",\" in which a fictional barber in wartime Germany describes his time as a hair stylist for Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking Nazi officers.\\n\\nKersten also appears as a character in the film ''Hitler: a film from Germany'', directed by Hans-Jürgen Syberberg.\\n\\nBOOK:\"Klerk en Beul\"http://www.archive.org/details/KlerkEnBeul_767\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Female epic", "body": "The female epic is a concept in literary criticism that seeks to expand generic boundaries by identifying ways in which women authors have adapted the masculine epic tradition to express their own heroic visions. \\n\\nHistorically, epic literature has been considered an exclusively male domain, to the extent that \"epic and masculinity appear to be almost coterminous.\"  From Homer's Iliad to Milton's Paradise Lost, the epic canon has been defined by works authored by men, and the characteristic subject matter and diction of the epic have carried connotations of masculinity. Recently, however, feminist literary critics have identified a number of texts written by women which, they argue, deserve to be considered epics, as they have many of the required qualities: emphasis on hero, nation building, religious authority, a strong quest motif, and significant length. Because these texts post-date Milton’s Paradise Lost – conventionally considered to be the last authentic epic in the Western tradition –  they are by default \"modern epics\".However, argue these critics, this is by no means a contradiction. The epic remains an authentic and vital literary genre, and one to which women have made valuable contributions. \\n\\nThe breadth of these studies is indicated by the essays in Bernard Schweizer's Approaches to the Anglo and American Female Epic, 1621-1982 (2006), which features studies of, among others, Lady Mary Wroth’s Urania, Mary Tighe’s Psyche, Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s Aurora Leigh, Sharon Doubiago’s Hard Country, and Rebecca West’s Black Lamb and Grey Falcon.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Feminist art movement", "body": "The feminist art movement refers to the efforts and accomplishments of feminists internationally to make art that reflects women's lives and experiences, as well as to change the foundation for the production and reception of contemporary art. It also sought to bring more visibility to women within art history and art practice. Corresponding with general developments within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the late 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s as an outgrowth of the so-called second wave of feminism; its effects continue to the present.\\n\\nThe nation’s first feminist art education program took place at California State University, Fresno in California in 1970 when fifteen female students and instructor Judy Chicago helped pioneer key strategies of the early feminist art movement, including collaboration, the use of “female technologies” like costume, performance, and video, and early forms of media critique. Judy Chicago, with painter Miriam Schapiro, went on to found the feminist art program at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in Los Angeles, whose students created, in 1972, a month-long installation in an empty house, entitled Womanhouse. At CalArts at that same time, Sheila Levrant de Bretteville founded a feminist design program and Deena Metzger was teaching feminist writing.\\n\\nThe Woman's Building which included the Feminist Studio Workshop was founded by Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, art historian Arlene Raven, and Judy Chicago in 1973. Many of the feminist artists and designers from CalArts joined other feminist artists at the Woman's Building, an important center of the west coast feminist artist movement in the 1970s and 1980s in which meetings, workshops, performances, and exhibitions regularly took place. Womanspace Gallery relocated there. During the first year, there were national conferences on feminist film, writing, ceramics, among others. \\n\\nSimultaneously, women artists in New York also began to come together for meetings and exhibitions. Collective galleries such as A.I.R. in New York and Artemisia in Chicago were formed to provide visibility for art by feminist artists. The strength of the feminist movement allowed for the emergence and visibility of many new types of work by women but also helped facilitate a range of new practices by men.\\n\\nThe Women's Interart Center in New York, founded in the 1970s in New York City, is still in operation. The Women's Video Festival was held yearly for a number of years in the early 1970s, also in New York City. Many women artists continue to organize working groups, collectives, and nonprofit galleries in various locales around the world.\\n\\nA small number of mostly American women, among the many thousands associated with feminist art, are artists Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro, founders of the first known Feminist Art Program (in Fresno, California), Suzanne Lacy, Faith Wilding, Martha Rosler, Mary Kelly, Kate Millett, Nancy Spero, Faith Ringgold, June Wayne, Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Dara Birnbaum, art-world agitators The Guerrilla Girls, and critics, historians, and curators Lucy Lippard, Griselda Pollock, Arlene Raven, Catherine de Zegher, and Eleanor Tufts.\\n\\nThe Feminist Art Project (TFAP) was founded by the Institute for Women and Arts at Rutgers University. The Feminist Art Project is an international collaborative initiative focusing on the Feminist Art Movement and the aesthetic, intellectual and political impact of women on the visual arts, art history, and art practice, past and present. The project is a strategic intervention against the ongoing erasure of women from the cultural record. The Feminist Art Project promotes diverse feminist art events, education and publications through its website and online calendar and facilitates networking and regional program development worldwide. The Feminist Art Project brings together feminist artists, curators, critics, and educators from all backgrounds to shine a spotlight on the accomplishments of the Feminist Art Movement. Its primary goal is to increase the visibility of feminist art and to promote the recognition of the aesthetic and intellectual impact of women on the visual arts and culture. TFAP facilitates regional networking and program development internationally by linking visitors to TFAP Regional Coordinators, now 40 in number. As a result, many universities have created courses dedicated to surveying women's contributions to the art world, and many workshops around the nation have taught and displayed the dynamic elements of feminist art. The Feminist Art Project Calendar posts over 1300 feminist art events and publications. Educational materials are available for downloading from the site's Resource pages called FARE (Feminist Art Resources in Education)\\n\\nThe Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum is an exhibition and education facility dedicated to feminist art and to raising awareness of feminism's cultural contributions. The Dinner Party (1974–79) by Judy Chicago, is housed there along with a biographical gallery highlighting the women represented in \"The Dinner Party\".\\n\\n"}

The first vehicle was delivered to the Netherlands in July 2003 and the first to Germany in December of the same year. Deliveries will continue until 2011 (additional orders for the German Army are planned from 2015 on). \\n\\nThe Dutch SP Aerospace company, which produced the Fennek for the Dutch military, was declared bankrupt in August 2004. A new company called Dutch Defence Vehicle Systems (DDVS) was created to continue the production of the vehicles for the Royal Netherlands Army.\\n\\nThe Fennek has four wheels with selectable two or four wheel drive. It has a Deutz diesel engine producing 179 kW, giving it a top speed of 115 km/h. Tire pressure can be regulated by the driver from inside the vehicle to suit terrain conditions. \\n\\nThe primary mission equipment is an observation package mounted on an extendable mast. Sensors include a thermal imager, daylight camera and a laser rangefinder. Combined with the vehicle's GPS and inertial navigation system the operator can accurately mark targets or points of interest and pass that data to the digital battlefield network. The sensor head of the observation package can also be removed and mounted on a tripod for concealed operation, as can the control unit from the vehicle should the crew want to use the entire system dismounted. Many Fenneks of the German Army are also equipped with Aladin miniature UAVs.\\n\\nVarious weapons can be fitted, such as a 12.7 mm machine gun for the Dutch reconnaissance version, a Rafael Spike anti-tank missile on the Dutch MRAT version or a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher (HK GMG) or Rheinmetall MG3 for the German vehicles. The Royal Netherlands Army also placed an order at the Turkish company Aselsan for 18 Raytheon Stinger surface-to-air missile launchers to be fitted on the Fennek.\\n\\nThe vehicle is protected all-round against 7.62 mm rounds and additional armour can be added if the mission requires. The air conditioning system provides protection against nuclear, biological and chemical warfare and the crew compartment is protected against anti-personnel mines.\\n\\nBoth Germany and the Netherlands have deployed Fennek reconnaissance vehicles to Afghanistan in support of ISAF. On 3 November 2007 a Dutch Fennek was hit by an improvised explosive device killing one and wounding two other occupants. The vehicle and its crew were taking part in an offensive operation targeting the Taliban in the province of Uruzgan, Afghanistan.In another incident a German Fennek was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Its hollow charge jet penetrated the vehicle through the right front wheel rim, passed through the vehicle and blew the left door off the hinge. Thanks to the spall liner the crew sustained only negligible injuries.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Feral", "body": "thumbthumbA feral organism is one that has escaped from domestication and returned, partly or wholly, to a wild state. The introduction of feral animals or plants to their non-native regions, like any introduced species, can disrupt ecosystems and may, in some cases, contribute to extinction of indigenous species. However, returning lost species to their environment can have the opposite effect, bringing damaged ecosystems back into balance.\\n\\nIn addition to the meaning of the word feral described here, from Latin fera, \"a wild beast\", the word has a second unrelated meaning, from Latin feralis, \"belonging to the dead\", \"funeral\".\\n\\nThe dictionary definition of a feral animal is one which has escaped from a domestic or captive status and is living more or less as a wild animal. Zoologists generally exclude from the ‘feral’ category animals which were genuinely wild before they escaped from captivity: neither lion escaped from a zoo nor the sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) recently re-introduced into the UK are regarded as 'feral'. As far as animals are concerned, this article assumes the ‘zoological definition’ of feral. Some common examples of animals with feral populations are goat, cat, and pig. \\n\\nThe term 'feral' should not be used to describe the naturalization of a wild (i.e. non-domesticated) species. Nor should \"feral\" be used to describe a population of a species which although descended from a domesticated population has severed itself from dependence on humans and lived independently in the wild for a long period.\\n\\nDomesticated plants that revert to wild are usually referred to as escaped, introduced or naturalized rather than feral. However, the adaptive and ecological variables seen in plants that go wild closely resemble those of animals.\\n\\nCertain familiar animals go feral easily and successfully, while others are much less inclined to wander and usually fail promptly outside domestication.\\n\\nSome species will detach readily from humans and pursue their own devices, but do not stray far or spread readily. Others depart and are gone, seeking out new territory or range to exploit and displaying active invasiveness.\\n\\nWhether they leave readily and venture far, the ultimate criterion for success is longevity. Persistence depends on their ability to establish themselves and reproduce reliably in the new environment.\\n\\nNeither the duration nor the intensity with which a species has been domesticated offers a useful correlation with its feral potential.\\n\\nthumbDog can revert to wildness, becoming predators little less effective than the big cat of like size. The Dingo is the oldest verifiable feral dog population, with a history of at least 3500 years (possibly more) since their original escape from domestication, although the pariah dog of Asia may well be older feral populations. The Carolina Dog is the oldest feral dog population known in cat land in the Americas. \\n\\nThe cat returns readily to a feral state if it has not been socialized properly in its young life. (See Feral cat.) These cats, especially if left to proliferate, are frequently considered to be pests in both rural and urban areas, and may be blamed for devastating the bird, reptile and mammal populations. A local population of feral cats living in an urban area and using a common food source is sometimes called a feral cat colony. As feral cats multiply quickly, it is difficult to control their populations. Animal shelters attempt to adopt out feral cats, especially kittens, but often are overwhelmed with sheer numbers and euthanasia is used. In rural areas, excessive numbers of feral cats are often shot. More recently, the \"Trap-Neuter-Return\" method has been used in many locations as an alternate means of managing the feral cat population.\\n\\nthumb goat is one of the oldest domesticated creatures, yet readily goes feral and does quite well on its own.\\n\\nThe dromedary camel, which has been domesticated for well over 3,000 years, will also readily go feral. A substantial population of feral dromedaries, descended from pack animals that escaped in the 19th and early 20th centuries, thrives in the Australia interior today.\\n\\nSheep are close contemporaries and cohorts of goats in the history of domestication, but the domestic sheep is quite vulnerable to predation and injury, and thus rarely if ever is seen in a feral state. However, in places where there are few predators, they get on well, for example in the case of the Soay sheep.\\n\\nWater buffalo run rampant in Western and Northern Australia. This is the only part of the world where they are legally hunted in their original range. The Australian government encourages the hunting of feral water buffalo because of their large numbers.\\n\\nCattle have been domesticated since the neolithic era, but can do well enough on open range for months or even years with little or no supervision. Their ancestors, the Aurochs, were quite fierce, on par with the modern Cape Buffalo. Modern cattle, especially those raised on open range, are generally more docile, but when threatened can display aggression. Cattle, particularly those raised for beef, are often allowed to roam quite freely and have established long term independence in Australia, New Zealand and several Pacific Islands along with small populations of semi-feral animals roaming the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Such cattle are variously called Mavericks, Scrubbers or Cleanskins. Most free roaming cattle, however untamed, are generally too valuable not to be eventually rounded up and recovered in closely settled regions.\\n\\nHorse and donkey, domesticated about 5000 BCE, are feral in open grasslands worldwide (see feral horse). In Portugal, feral horses are called Sorraia; in Australia, they are called Brumbies; in the American west, they are called Mustangs. Other isolated feral populations exist, including the Chincoteague Pony and the Banker Horse. They are often referred to as \"wild horse,\" but this is a misnomer. There are truly \"wild\" horses that have never been tamed, most notably Przewalski's Horse. While the horse was originally indigenous to North America, the wild ancestor died out at the end of the last Ice Age. In both Australia and the Americas, modern \"wild\" horses descended from domesticated horses brought by European explorers and settlers that escaped, spread, and thrived.thumb\\n\\nThe pig (hog) has established feral populations worldwide, most notably in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, New Guinea and the Pacific Islands. Pigs were introduced to the Melanesian and Polynesian regions by humans from several thousand to five hundred years ago, and to Australia and the Americas within the past 500 years. While pigs were doubtlessly brought to New Zealand by the original Polynesian settlers, this population had become extinct by the time of European colonization, and all feral pigs in New Zealand today are descendants of European stock. Many European wild boar populations are also partially descended from escaped domestic pigs and are thus technically feral animals within the native range of the ancestral species.\\n\\nRock Pigeon were formerly kept for their meat or more commonly as racing animals and have established feral populations in cities worldwide.\\n\\nColonies of honey bees often escape into the wild from managed apiaries when they swarm; their behavior, however, is no different from their behavior \"in captivity\", until and unless they breed with other feral honey bees of a different genetic stock, which may lead them to become more docile or more aggressive (see Africanized bee).\\n\\nLarge colonies of feral parrots are present in various parts of the world, with Rose-ringed Parakeet, Monk Parakeet and Red-masked Parakeet (the latter of which became the subject of the documentary film, The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill) being particularly successful outside of their native habitats and adapting well to suburban environments.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nA feral population can have a significant impact on an ecosystem by predation on vulnerable plants or animals, or by competition with indigenous species. Feral plants and animals constitute a significant share of invasive species, and can be a threat to endangered species.\\n\\nAnimals of domestic origin sometimes can produce fertile hybrids with native, wild animals which leads to genetic pollution (not a clear term itself) in the naturally evolved wild gene pools, many times threatening rare species with extinction. Cases include the mallard duck, wild boar, the rock dove or pigeon, the Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus) (ancestor of all chickens), carp, and more recently salmon . Another example is the dingo, itself an early feral dog, which interbreeds with dogs of other origin. However it is seen as unlikely that this will disrupt the ecosystems in which these dogs live and some regard the importance of this phenomenon as disputable. In some cases like rabbit, genetic pollution seems not to be noticed. There is much debate over the degree to which feral hybridization compromises the purity of a wild species. In the case of the mallard, for example, some claim there are no populations that are completely free of any domestic ancestor. \\n\\nFeral animals compete with domestic livestock, and may degrade fences, water sources, and vegetation (by overgrazing or introducing seeds of invasive plants). Though hotly disputed, some cite as an example the competition between feral horses and cattle in the western United States. Another example is of goats competing with cattle in Australia, or goats that degrade trees and vegetation in environmentally-stressed regions of Africa. Accidental crossbreeding by feral animals may result in harm to breeding programs of pedigreed animals; their presence may also excite domestic animals and push them to escape. Feral populations can also pass on transmissible infections to domestic herds.\\n\\nMany feral animals can sometimes be captured at little cost and thus constitute a significant resource. Throughout most of Polynesia and Melanesia feral pigs constitute the primary sources of animal protein. Prior to the Free-roaming Wild Horse and Burro Protection Act of 1971, American mustangs were routinely captured and sold for horsemeat. In Australia feral goats, pigs and dromedaries are harvested for the export for their meat trade. At certain times, animals were sometimes deliberately left to go feral, typically on islands, in order to be later recovered for profit or food use for travelers (particularly sailors) at the end of a few years.\\n\\nPopulations of feral animals present good sources for studies of population dynamics, and especially of ecology and behavior (ethology) in a wild state of species known mainly in a domestic state. Such observations can provide useful information for the stock breeders or other owners of the domesticated conspecifics (i.e. animals of the same species).\\n\\nFeral populations sometimes preserve or develop characteristics which do not always exist in the fully domesticated equivalent. Therefore, they contribute to domestic biodiversity and often deserve to be preserved, be it in their feral environment or as domestic animals. For example, feral species that are usually subjects of eradication in Australia or New Zealand are currently the subject of study to determine if there is a need for their preservation.\\n\\nAmerican Mustangs have been protected since 1971 in part due to their romance and connection to the history of the American West.\\n\\nNote: Links that treat feral animals as a mere pest issue are the norm.\\n\\n"}

In 1868 he volunteered to join an expedition against the Bonga of Zambésia in Mozambique and was promoted to second lieutenant. After which he was transferred to the garrison in Angola and there appointed as aide-de-camp to the Governor-General of Moçambique. His uncle, Fernando da Costa Leal (1825–1869), was appointed shortly after as Governor-General of Moçambique so that the two Fernandos travelled together to Ilha de Moçambique.\\n\\nOn 26 June 1869 the young Fernando da Costa Leal was appointed by his uncle to secretary of the Diplomatic Commission under the chairmanship of Carlos Pedro Barahona e Costa (1833–1876), to go to the ZAR to determine borders and negotiate trade agreements.The Commission sailed to Durban, travelled through the Orange Free State and arrived in Potchefstroom on 7 December 1869.From here they visited places such as Pretoria and Rustenburg. On 17 May 1870 da Costa Leal resigned this post and accompanied German naturalist and explorer, Carl Mauch (1837–1875), on a journey from Potchefstroom to Lourenço Marques to explore potential routes between the ZAR and Delagoa Bay. It was on this trip that Leal compiled a report of his impressions of his stay in the ZAR and the journey from Potchefstroom via Pretoria, Botšhabelo, New Scotland, the southern part of Swaziland, the Lebombo Mountains and Catembe to Lourenço Marques (lasting from 18 May to 8 August 1870). In 1871 da Costa Leal was placed in charge of construction of the planned route between Moçambique and the ZAR up to the Lebombo Mountains. Towards the end of April 1871 the Portuguese reported that the surveys had been completed and that construction of the road had begun. \\n\\nShortly after da Costa Leal left Moçambique for Lisbon, where in 1874 he was transferred to the Royal army.

During this era of the festival, it was custom that one version of the song was performed by a native Italian artist while the other version was performed by an international guest artist. The festival has been used as the way of choosing Italy's Eurovision entry from 1956 to 1966, in 1972 and 1997. The festival has also launched the careers of many very famous Italian singers, most notably Andrea Bocelli, Giorgia, Mietta, Elisa, Laura Pausini and Eros Ramazzotti\\n\\nThe Festival is broadcast live on TV Rai Uno in Eurovision Network since 1955. From 1951 to 1954 it was transmitted only on radio RAI.\\n\\nNotable guest artists of that time were, among others:\\n\\n"}

Founded in 1971, by Claude Chamberlan and Dimitri Eipides, it is an annual independent film festival held in Montreal and features independent films from around the world. Over 160,000 people make their way to Montreal to attend the prestigious festival each year. The festival is an Academy Award qualifying festival for short films.\\n\\nIn 2004 Daniel Langlois, director of FNC since 1999, left the organization to begin the Festival International de Films de Montréal (known in English as New Montreal FilmFest), which was initiated and created with the support of SODEC (Société de développement des entreprises culturelles) and Telefilm Canada after a dispute between these Canadian government sponsors and the Montreal World Film Festival.\\n\\nLanglois initially programmed the Festival International de Films de Montréal (New Montreal FilmFest) to coincide with the Montreal Festival of New Cinema and New Media (FCMM). According to press reports pertaining to the controversy between the Montreal World Film Festival and the New Montreal FilmFest, Langlois planned to merge the two festivals, but failed to do so when the FCMM refused any such merger. The dates for the inaugural New Montreal FilmFest were ultimately changed to avoid conflicting with the dates of the FCMM.\\n\\nIn 2005 both the FNC and the New Montreal FilmFest came under new management. In early 2006, the New Montreal FilmFest folded after the failure of its inaugural festival. Both the FNC and the Montreal World Film Festival continue to exist.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fetter (Buddhism)", "body": "In Buddhism, a mental fetter or \"chain\" or \"bond\" (Pāli: samyojana, saŋyojana, saññojana) shackles a sentient being to samsara, the cycle of endless suffering. By completely cutting through all fetters, one attains Nibbana (Pali; Skt.: Nirvana).\\n\\nThroughout the Pali canon, the word \"fetter\" is used to describe an intrapsychic phenomenon that ties one to suffering. For instance, in the Khuddaka Nikaya's Itivuttaka 1.15, the Buddha states:\\n\\nElsewhere, the suffering caused by a fetter is implied as in this more technical discourse from SN 35.232, where Ven. Sariputta converses with Ven. Kotthita:\\n\\nThe fetters are enumerated in different ways in the Pali canon's Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. \\n\\nThe Pali canon's Sutta Pitaka identifies ten \"fetters of becoming\":\\n\\nAs indicated in the table to the right, throughout the Sutta Pitaka, the first five fetters are referred to as \"lower fetters\" (orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni) and are eradicated upon becoming a non-returner; and, the last five fetters are referred to as \"higher fetters\" (uddhambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni), eradicated by an arahant.\\n\\nBoth the Sagīti Sutta (DN 33) and the Dhammasai (Dhs. 1002-1006) refer to the \"three fetters\" as the first three in the aforementioned Sutta Pitaka list of ten:\\n\\nAccording to the Canon, these three fetters are eradicated by stream-enterer and once-returner.\\n\\nThe Abhidhamma Pitaka's Dhamma Sangani (Dhs. 1113-34) provides an alternate list of ten fetters, also found in the Khuddaka Nikaya's Culla Niddesa (Nd2 656, 1463) and in post-canonical commentaries. This enumeration is: \\n\\nUniquely, the Sutta Pitaka's \"Householder Potaliya\" Sutta (MN 54), identifies eight fetters (including three of the Five Precepts) whose abandonment \"lead[s] to the cutting off of affairs\" (vohāra-samucchedāya saṃvattanti): (1) destroying life (); (2) stealing (); (3) false speech (musāvādo); (4) slandering (pisunā); (5) coveting and greed (giddhilobho); (6) aversion (nindāroso); (7) anger and malice (kodhūpāyāso); and, (8) conceit (atimāno).\\n\\nThe following fetters are the first three mentioned in the aforementioned Sutta Pitaka list of ten fetters, and the Sagīti Sutta's and the Abhidhamma Pitaka's list of \"three fetters\" (DN 33, Dhs. 1002 ff.). As indicated below, eradication of these three fetters is a canonical indicator of one's being irreversibly established on the path to Enlightenment.\\n\\nEtymologically, kāya means \"body,\" sakkāya means \"existing body,\" and  means \"view\" (often implying a wrong view, in Buddhism, as exemplified by the views in the table below).\\n\\nIn general, \"belief in an individual self\" or, more simply, \"self view\" refers to a \"belief that in one or other of the khandha there is a permanent entity, an attā.\"\\n\\nSimilarly, in MN 2, the Sabbasava Sutta, the Buddha describes \"a fetter of views\" in the following manner:\\n\\nIn general, \"doubt\" refers to doubt about the Buddha's teachings, the Dhamma. (Alternate contemporaneous teachings are represented in the table to the right.)\\n\\nMore specifically, in SN 22.84, the Tissa Sutta, the Buddha explicitly cautions against uncertainty regarding the Noble Eightfold Path, which is described as the right path to Nibbana, leading one past ignorance, sensual desire, anger and despair.\\n\\nSīla refers to \"moral conduct\", vata (or bata) to \"religious duty, observance, rite, practice, custom,\" and parāmāsa to \"being attached to\" or \"a contagion\" and has the connotation of \"mishandling\" the Dhamma. Altogether, sīlabbata-parāmāso has been translated as \"the contagion of mere rule and ritual, the infatuation of good works, the delusion that they suffice\" or, more simply, \"fall[ing] back on attachment to precepts and rules.\"\\n\\nWhile the fetter of doubt can be seen as pertaining to the teachings of competing ''samana'' during the times of the Buddha, this fetter regarding rites and rituals likely refers to some practices of contemporary brahmanic authorities.\\n\\nIn MN 64, the \"Greater Discourse to Mālunkyāputta,\" the Buddha states that the path to abandoning the five lower fetters (that is, the first five of the aforementioned \"ten fetters\") is through using jhana attainment and vipassana insights in tandem. In SN 35.54, \"Abandoning the Fetters,\" the Buddha states that one abandons the fetters \"when one knows and sees ... as impermanent\" (Pali: anicca) the twelve sense bases (āyatana), the associated six sense-consciousness (), and the resultant contact (phassa) and sensations (vedanā). Similarly, in SN 35.55, \"Uprooting the Fetters,\" the Buddha states that one uproots the fetters \"when one knows and sees ... as nonself\" (anatta) the sense bases, sense consciousness, contact and sensations.\\n\\nThe Pali canon traditionally describes cutting through the fetters in four stages:\\n\\nSimilar Buddhist concepts found throughout the Pali Canon include the five hindrances (nīvaraāni) and the ten defilements (''kilesā''). Comparatively speaking, in the Theravada tradition, fetters span multiple lifetimes and are difficult to remove, while hindrances are transitory obstacles. Defilements encompass all mental defilements including both fetters and hindrances.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fetters", "body": "thumbFetters, shackles, footcuffs, Legcuffs or leg irons are a kind of physical restraint used on the feet or ankle to allow walking but prevent running and kicking. The term \"fetter\" shares a root with the word \"foot\".\\n\\nWith respect to humans, typically only prison or bondage fetish will wear shackles. A shackled animal is typically either a dangerous animal or one prone to escape.\\n\\nMetaphor, a fetter may be anything that restricts or restrains in any way, hence the word \"unfettered\".\\n\\nthumbThe earliest fetters found in archaeological excavations date from the prehistoric age and are mostly of the puzzle lock type. Roman times already see a variety of restraint types. Some early versions of cup lock shackles can already be found. These were widely used in medieval times but their use declined when mass production made the manufacture of locks built into restraints affordable. \\n\\nSimple fetter types continue to be used like puzzle lock shackles as the typical slave iron or irons riveted shut for prisoners being transported to overseas prison camps. thumbThe First built-in locks often were of a simple screw-type but soon developed into the \"Darby\" type. In Europe these continued to be used into the middle of the 20th century, whereas in the US from the late 19th century onwards many new designs were invented and produced before handcuffs and leg irons of the Peerless type became the standard several decades ago.\\n\\nA recent development of the last few decades are high security restraints that incorporate a cylinder lock that is more difficult to pick than the lock on standard type cuffs.\\n\\nthumbIn comparison to handcuffs the wearing of leg irons may be found less restrictive. Thus the prison authorities in several countries deem their long term use acceptable. In order to avoid condoning this disputed practice the countries of the European Union have banned exporting leg irons into non-EU countries. The countries that continue to make prisoners wear fetters long term now tend to resort to manufacturing their own restraints.\\n\\nThese are widely used in BDSM activities on submissive by the dominant. This can be used as a restrain to the movement of the submissive in tease and denial and also in tie and tease. This is widely used as a part of the scene in various BDSM activities such as Human Furniture, Bondage, Public Humiliation, animal play, pony play, puppy play etc...\\n\\n"}

The Modello 14 seems to have begun the Italian fascination with over-complicated loading systems and the need for lubricating rounds to prevent jamming, which often had the opposite effect. The Modello 35 attempted to remove some of these flaws by opting for a more conventional belt feed and eliminating the oil pump. The opportunity was also taken to adopt the 8 mm round also found in the Breda. These modifications seemingly failed to improve the weapon to a great degree though; it was found that lubrication was still required, needing individual rounds to be greased or the oil pump to be re-fitted, which notably impaired reliability.\\n\\nProduction ended in 1943. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fiat Tempra", "body": "The Fiat Tempra is a small family car produced by Italian automaker Fiat from 1990 to 1998. The Tempra was intended as a replacement for the Fiat Regata. The original project was called Tipo 3, being a mid-size car between the Fiat Tipo (project Tipo 2) and the bigger Fiat Croma (project Tipo 4). The Tempra shares its platform with the Lancia Dedra and Alfa Romeo 155.\\n\\nThe Tempra was awarded the 1991 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland.\\n\\nThe Tempra saloon was introduced in February 1990 with the station wagon (marketed as the \"Tempra SW\") arriving later in the year. The initial engine range comprised 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 petrol units and normally aspirated and turbocharged 1.9-litre diesel units.\\n\\n200px\\n\\nThe Tempra's engine range was similar to that of the Tipo. Initially 1.4 and 1.6-litre models had carburettor engines. Both of these models were discontinued in 1992 due to the new European emission standards and thus all models from 1992 on had catalytic converters and electronic injection. Transmission was a standard 5 speed manual, but for the first time a mid size sedan was offered as with a continuously variable transmission which was previously available on Fiat Uno, Panda, Ritmo and Tipo. 2.0-litre-models were also available with an optional 4-speed automatic transmission.\\n\\nDuring its 6 year production run, few changes were made apart from a minor facelift in 1993 resulting in a new front grille and other minor styling changes.\\n\\nChassis and main parts (most notably, the doors) were shared with the Fiat Tipo. Other vehicles, derived from the same project were Lancia Dedra (Tempra's most similar cousin, sharing all mechanical components), Lancia Delta second generation, Alfa Romeo 155, Alfa 145 and Alfa 146.\\n\\nOnly two trim levels were available in its early years: standard (S) and SX, both reasonably equipped considering its cheap price.\\n\\nSX models for example, featured power windows, power locks, adjustable belts and steering wheel, front fog lights, body coloured bumpers, velvet upholstery, a futuristic digital dashboard and many other standard extras. They were also available with optional extras like anti-lock brakes, alloy wheels, sunroof, electronic climate control, etc.\\n\\nA facelift in 1993 featured more trim levels from standard L models (only available with 1.4 engine) S, SX and SLX only available with 1.8 and 2.0 litre engines.An optional driver's airbag was another innovation that year.\\n\\nThere was also the Marengo (a title also used before with the Regata and later with the Marea), which represented the commercial version of Tempra, based on the estate version with no rear seats.\\n\\n200px200px\\n\\nQuattroruote, a popular Italian motoring magazine, reported some failures and defects with the Tempra. The first issue to be reported was some water ingress through the windscreen seals, an issue that previously plagued some other Fiat vehicles, especially Alfa 33, which in rainy conditions would carry a significant quantity of water on-board. This problem was reported from 1990–92 and was resolved with using a higher quantity of sealant when fitting the glass.\\n\\nAnother reported problem was a high oil consumption, especially the 1,581 cc engine, which was a common defect with Tipo (with the same engine) and Panda (1000 FIRE engine). The same was reported for other Fiat's vehicles, but seemed to disappear with the new 1.6 L 66 kW engine.\\n\\nOn the same model, from 1994, the car started to show some electronic malfunctions, with items such as the electronic control unit, code key and electric system. A design flaw of the Tempra was that its rear window was too small and inclined and the tail too tall, so that rear visibility was poor. This issue was common with the 155 and Dedra, and was one of the reason the estate had more success than the saloon, especially in the UK.\\n\\nSince the beginning, the Tempra was presented as a cheap and reliable car. 1.4 and 1.6 engines were able to run long distances with good fuel economy, also aided by a high capacity tanks of  for the sedan and  for the Station Wagon. Average range for a 55 kW 1.6 litre sedan was around  (), and consumption at constant speed was of  at  and  at . All these were aided by a favorable aerodynamic (Cx 0,297) and only 17,2 PS subtracted at , which was the best result among all the rivals. thumb\\n\\nThere was also a Marengo version, a name also used before with the Regata and later the Marea). This is a commercial version of the Tempra SW, with no rear seats and registered as a truck.\\n\\nleft\\n\\nThe Tempra was discontinued in Europe in 1996, and in Brazil in 1998. It was replaced by the Fiat Marea, which is based on the Fiat Bravo and Fiat Brava platform, the replacements for the Tempra's sister car the Fiat Tipo.\\n\\nIn Brazil 204,795 Tempras were produced in eight years, and in Turkey, where the car was manufactured by Tofaş from 1990 until 1995, 129,590 were made.\\n\\nTempra\\n\\n"}

In Vietnam, it is called sung. \\n\\nIt serves as a food plant for the caterpillars of the butterfly the Two-brand Crow (Euploea sylvester) of northern Australia.\\n\\nIn the Atharva Veda, this fig tree (Sanskrit: uumbara or udumbara) is given prominence as a means for acquiring prosperity and vanquishing foes. For instance, regarding an amulet of the udumbara tree, a hymn (AV xix,31) extols:\\n\\nIt has been described in the story of Raja Harischandra of the Ikshvaku dynasty, that the crown was a branch of this Udumbura tree, set in a circlet of gold. Additionally, the Throne (simhasana) was constructed out of this wood and the royal personage would ascend it on his knee, chanting to the gods to ascend it with him, which they did so, albeit unseen.\\n\\nthumbBoth the tree and the flower are referred to as the udumbara (Sanskrit, Pali; Devanagari: उडुम्बर) in Buddhism. Udumbara can also refer to the blue lotus (Nila udumbara) flower. The udumbara flower appears in chapters 2 and 27 of the Lotus Sutra, an important Mahayana Buddhist text. The Japanese word udonge (優曇華) was used by Dōgen Zenji to refer to the flower of the udumbara tree in chapter 68 of the Shōbōgenzō (\"Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma‎\"). Dōgen places the context of the udonge flower in the Flower Sermon given by Gautama Buddha on Vulture Peak. Udonge is also used to refer to the eggs of the lacewing insect. The eggs are laid in a pattern similar to a flower, and its shape is used for divination in Asian fortune telling.\\n\\nthumbIn historical times both Hindu and Buddhist ascetics on their way to Taxila, (Original name is Taksha Sila) travelling through vast areas of Indian forests used to consume the fruit during their travels. One challenge to vegetarians were the many fig wasp that one finds when opening a gular fig. One way to get rid of them was to break the figs into halves or quarters, discard most of the seeds and then place the figs into the midday sun for an hour.

{"title": "Field system", "body": "The study of field systems (collections of fields) in landscape history is concerned with the size, shape and orientation a number of fields. These are often adjacent, but may be separated by a later feature.\\n\\nBecause fields were organised for the convenience of the farmer, the size of fields often gives an indication of the type of agriculture and agricultural implements in use when they were established. The shape and orientation of collections of fields provides clues about the date they were established. The extent to which the field system respects other features (or not) can be used as dating evidence for the other features or the field system itself. For example, a field system that doesn't respect a Roman road is likely to predate it. Similarly, a feature that respects medieval ridge and furrow is likely to post date it.\\n\\nSo called Celtic fields can date from the Bronze Age through to the early Middle Ages. These fields are typically small and rectangular. They are frequently coaxial - that is they form a system in which the boundaries of adjacent fields make a series of long, roughly parallel lines. The extensive coaxial field systems established by the Romans are described as centuriation.thumb\\n\\nOpen fields were very large fields in which many individual farmers cultivated their own strips. In England, enclosure of open fields during the 18th and 19th century produced field systems with larger rectangular fields, often with blackthorn hedges. Adjacent areas were often enclosed at different times, leading to a change in orientation of the field systems between the two areas. The pattern of ridge and furrow will often reveal the layout of the original open fields. In parts of England where enclosure took place early (or which were never enclosed), fields are often small and have an irregular shape, sometimes described as \"pocket handkerchief\".\\n\\nRecent changes of agricultural practice are eliminating old field boundaries, particularly by removing hedges, to produce much larger fields reminiscent of traditional open fields.\\n\\nThe boundaries of earlier field systems that have fallen out of use, can sometimes be deduced by studying earthworks (lumps and bumps), cropmark or by using geophysics. Studying early maps will often show the field system in use at the time the map was prepared. From the mid 17th century, landowners began to commission estate maps that show the size and layout of the fields they own. However, for many English parishes, the earliest written evidence of their field system is from the enclosure maps or tithe maps.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fieschi family", "body": "The Fieschi were a noble family from Genoa, Italy, from whom descend the Fieschi Ravaschieri Princes of Belmonte. \\n\\nThey held the fief of Lavagna under the Holy Roman Emperor. As Counts of Lavagna the Fieschi represented the Emperor of the West in Liguria from the earliest years of the C11th. In 1010 the investiture of the Fieschi took place at Genoa: the family were created Counts of Lavagna and Imperial Vicars General (ie Viceroys) of the whole of Tuscany and of the coast of Genoa. In the words of Henry the Holy, King of Italy since 1004 and Holy Roman Emperor from 1014 and the last of the Ottonian dynasty, 'Ordiniamo il predominato Fieschi vicario generale di essa città con ampio potere.' ('We appoint the pre-eminent Fieschi to be Vicars General of this city-state with broad powers'). \\n\\nThe Imperial Houses of Hohenstaufen, Luxembourg and later Habsburg each in turn confirmed the Counts in the rank of Count Palatine. \\n\\nMales of the Fieschi all of them styled Conte di Lavagna played major roles as Guelph partisans in the governance and military history of medieval Genoa, ever in conflict with the Republic and always retaining their connection with their holdings here. \\n\\nIn 1138, in an agreement between the Fieschi and the commune of Genoa, the Fieschi agreed to spend part of the year in the city. They earned great riches from trading and financial activities, and later developed in numerous different branches. Apart from Liguria, they possessed fiefs in Piedmont, Lombardy, Umbria and in the Kingdom of Naples.\\n\\nSinibaldo de' Fieschi, Count of Lavagna, became pope as Innocent IV in 1243, and his nephew Ottobuono was elected pope to succeed Adrian V on July 12, 1276, but died at Viterbo on August 18. \\n\\nIn the Fieschi conspiracy of 1547, Giovanni Luigi Fieschi and the nobles unsuccessfully attempted to recapture the dogate from Andrea Doria, and the power of the Fieschi was broken.\\n\\nCounts of Lavagna (Fieschi)\\n\\n"}

It was published in 1913 by William Heinemann in Britain and E.P. Dutton &amp; Company in the United States. It was Beerbohm's fifth book of caricatures, after Caricatures of Twenty-five Gentlemen (1896), The Poets' Corner (1904), A Book of Caricatures (1907), and Cartoons: The Second Childhood of John Bull (1911). \\n\\nPublished in 1913, Beerbohm's illustrations include caricatures of George Bernard Shaw, Lloyd George, Joseph Pennell, Lord Rosebery, John Masefield, George Grossmith, Jr., H. B. Irving, Auguste Rodin, Thomas Hardy, Bonar Law and Enrico Caruso and a collection of politicians of the time. The fifty caricatures appear on the rectos only, numbers 1 to 48 being executed in half-tone and mounted on brown paper, while numbers 49 to 50 are line drawings on white paper. The cover drawing of a corpulent be-laurelled man in profile was intended by Beerbohm to \"typify triumphant mediocrity,\" but soon for critics became a symbol for Beerbohm himself, his top-hat here at his side rather than perched jauntily on his head.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Filanbanco", "body": "Filanbanco was the largest bank in Ecuador. Founded in the city of Guayaquil, it went bankrupt in 2001 following the banking crisis of 1998.\\n\\nThe bank was originally called La Filantrópica (The Philanthropist). Under the leadership of Pedro Isaías Barquet, La Filantrópica promoted the development of small industry, commerce, and agriculture, and became established as a strong and solvent financial institution. At the time of Isaías Barquet's death in 1960, the family decided to save the bank and inject it with capital.\\n\\nIt was acquired in 1960 by the Isaías Group (Grupo Isaías), who decided to change its name to Filanbanco. They injected capital into the bank, aiming to provide Guayaquil with a bank that would further the expansion of the commercial and agricultural sector of the Littoral Region, whose trade in products like bananas and cacao was booming. \\n\\nThe bank belonged to the Isaías family for three generations.\\n\\nIn 1998, during the Ecuadorian financial crisis, the bank faced a liquidity crisis. It was sold to the government of Ecuador that year. It was merged by the government with the bank La Previsora in an operation questioned because Filanbank had to bear La Previsora's huge losses. Once in control of the Ecuadorian government, it was used as a bank of banks to allocate assets to provide liquidity to troubled banks in 2000 and 2001, during the banking crisis. Filanbanco closed its doors definitively in July 2001. \\n\\nThe state was conducting an investigation into the administration of the Isaías brothers. The Deposit Guarantee Agency (Agencia de Garantía de Depósitos, AGD) later seized control of several companies related to the Isaias family to recover an estimated $350 million still owed in relation to the restructuring of Filanbanco.\\n\\n"}

His appreciation for music came at an early age growing up in a family whose culture celebrated the art and spirit of music and literature. He started his adventure evolving from his roots as a Dee Jay into a self taught Guitarist and Songwriter at the age of 16.In his twenties he studied music Harmony & Composition with Cayetano Julio Conti and Professor Daniel Jauregui, Jazz Guitar with Pino Marrone and Rock Guitar with John Mizarolli. These masters fired up his transformation from shredding Guitarist & Songwriter into a complete Musician. In the new millennium he moved to London where he explored new territories beyond music such as Sociology and Philosophy. At the same time he began to sharpen his music production and sound design skills in a continuous search for new elements to incorporate into his own compositions. He is currently working freelance as a Music Producer and writing an album of all original material.\\n\\nwww.chelobianchi.com\\n\\n"}

{"title": "File:Charles Dada.jpg", "body": "Trained in Photography, Fine Art and Art History, Charles Dada’s last 5 years has been spent working with some of the UK’s most desirable artist's. Artists such as Dan Baldwin, Antony Micallef, Chris Kettle, Darvish Fakra, Rarekinds Daz and others. Now the artist and urban philosopher has re risen to create again, \\n\\nHis humble ideology of “Creativity as the ultimate human Power” has elevated him to showing with such top Artist’s as Damien Hirst, Dface, Blek Le Rat, Tracy Emin and Brazilian Superstars Flip, Tinho and Zezao. \\n\\nCharles believes Creativity to be the ultimate human Power, with which we are all born. Though some off us hold onto it and excel, and others believe deep down they still are. Many believe there are not, and worst still can’t remember ever having being creative. \\n\\n'The Splat' Series (The Creative Splat) \\n\\nCharles Dada’s love and appreciation for the evolution of art and the artists that created it, motivated him to dedicate this series to celebrate the creativity in us all. \\n\\nHe achieves this by breaking ‘painting’ down to its lowest common denominator, the brush stroke, the splat and the drip. By doing so he achieves the most un-intimidating paintings possible. While at the same time celebrating the marks them selves that embody the: conventional orthodox, expressionistic and urban eras of painting. \\n\\nBy removing the subject matter from the painting, Charles trades a visual gratification for a creative contemplation from the viewer. (by the viewer thinking “I can do that” Charles relights the creative flame within.) \\n\\n'Image Unavailable' Paintings \\n\\nThese work stem from the celebration of the mark side of the 'Splat' series. In my investigation to celebrating the brush stroke, Charles Dada originally painted canvases with colourful marks, mindless of direction, length and consciousness, till it was completely covered. He quickly realised that when given a surface of details to view, the mind starts to create images for itself. The logical conclusion from this point was to restrict the space of brush strokes to confined arears, like in text. To give the viewer a clue as to what they are looking at, I used the text “Image Unavailable” Now by restricting the viewer to the smaller painted spaces, only the brush strokes themselves can be appreciated. \\n\\n‘The Creation’ & ‘This is not’ Series \\n\\nThese are two series Charles currently is working on, more details at a later date, \\n\\n"}

First Amendment considerations override any expressive, noncommercial use of trademarks. \"The Constitution is not offended when the [Maine] antidilution statute is applied to prevent a defendant from using a trademark without permission in order to merchandise dissimilar products or services. ... The Constitution does not, however, permit the range of the antidilution statute to encompass the unauthorized use of a trademark in a noncommercial setting such as an editorial or artistic context.\" (emphasis added) L.L.

However, this right is diluted by trademark law insofar as that author cannot present her subject in a manner that confuses or misleads the public into believing, through the use of one or more trademarks, that those organizations have produced or sponsored the work in question.\" (emphasis added) Girl Scouts of the United States v.

Whereas the old drug chart focused on an overlapping of three circles with the antipsychotic ellipse added as a \"second thought\", the new chart is an even mix of four overlapping circles. While this adds the complexity of new color regions, and a shrinkage of some previous regions, I believe that it is a move in the right direction.

To determine the radar distance, he divides the elapsed time (as measured by an ideal clock which he carries) by two.\\n\\nAt right, the ring is rotating counterclockwise. At left, it is rotating clockwise. Equal but oppositely directed rotation will result in different values for the radar distance. In other words, a pair of Langevin observers riding a rotating ring who each determine radar distances to their peer will obtain different values. This illustrates the fact that radar distance \"in the large\" is not symmetric.\\n\\nThis figure was created by  using Xfig to export a png image; the labels were added using the GIMP.\\n\\n"}
