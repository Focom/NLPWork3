{"title": "Eblana", "body": "Eblana is the name of an ancient Irish settlement believed by some to have occupied the same site as the modern city of Dublin, to the extent that 19th-century scholarly writers such as Louis Agassiz used Eblana as a Latin equivalent for Dublin. The exact identity of this settlement, however, is still a matter of speculation.\\n\\nThe reference to a settlement in Ireland called Eblana in the Geographia of Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy), the Greek astronomer and cartographer, around the year 140 AD, is sometimes said to be the earliest reference to Dublin. This would seem to give Dublin a just claim to nearly two thousand years of antiquity, as the settlement must have existed a considerable time before Ptolemy became aware of it. But was Eblana Dublin?\\n\\nEarly Irish antiquarians, such as Sir John Ware and Walter Harris believed that the name Eblana in Ptolemy's Geographia was in fact a corruption of Deblana, itself a version of the Gaelic name Dubh Linn (Black Pool), from which the modern English language name Dublin derives. For one reason or another, it seems, ancient geographers often truncated the initial letters of place names. For example, instead of Pepiacum, and Pepidii (in Wales), Ptolemy writes Epiacum and Epidii; and for Dulcinium (now Ulcinj, in Montenegro), he has Ulcinium.\\n\\nThere are several problems with this theory:\\n\\nIn the light of these difficulties it is only fair to say that the identity of Ptolemy's Eblana is as yet unknown, and identification with the city of Dublin is at best problematic and highly speculative.\\n\\nThe Eblana Theatre was situated in the basement of Busaras, Dublin's central bus station, operated by Bus Éireann. A tiny theatre, famously without wings, it was open from 17 September 1959 until 1995. It was run by the indomitable Phyllis Ryan and home to her company Gemini Productions. Phyllis Ryan was in the 1960s and 1970s the major producer of new plays in Ireland outside of the Abbey Theatre. Phyllis Ryan and her Gemini Productions kept independent theatre alive in Dublin and premièred most of the work of playwright John B. Keane. The playwrights - Brian Friel, Joe O Donnell, Tom Murphy etc, that Gemini nurtured were later adopted by the Abbey and other theatres but owe their first productions to the courage of Phyllis Ryan.\\n\\nIn the mid 90s the Eblana was run for a short time by Andrew's Lane Theatre. Following this it was leased by Northside Theatre Company. It closed in 1995, was gutted, and turned into a left luggage facility.\\n\\n"}

Officially called Eck Stadium, Home of Tyler Field it is sometimes informally referred to as Eck.\\n\\nThe stadium, which has gone through numerous upgrades since its original completion, currently seats 7,851. This number does not include the Coleman Outfield Hill, made during the original construction because of lack of funding to haul the dirt away, which can seat hundreds more.\\n\\nOn Sept. 23, 1999, The Coleman Co. put a $500,000 exclamation point on Wichita State University's Project FutureShox, a $7.8 million effort to make Eck Stadium-Home of Tyler Field the premier collegiate baseball facility in the nation.Plans to significantly upgrade Eck Stadium-Home of Tyler field were first announced on Jan. 28, 1998, and were taken to another level with the leadership of Gene Stephenson, the winningest collegiate baseball coach since 1978.\\n\\nSeveral major contributors stepped forward on the front end of the project, and on Sept. 23, The Coleman Co. accentuated a project that had Wichita State on its way to having the best collegiate baseball facility in the country. \\n\\nThe Virginia H. Farah All-American Club accommodates nearly 200 fans, and features reserved box seats for up to 96 fans on a veranda level immediately in front of the club.\\n\\nMembership in the Virginia H. Farah All-American Club includes a skybox view of the game from the climate-controlled interior, complimentary food and beverage each game, priority parking and club admission for two fans per membership. \\n\\nThe Coleman Hill includes two pavilions and terraces that spruce up the hill. The pavilions feature two covered, split-level, hardwood decks with storage for chairs. One pavilion includes a fireplace. The pavilions provide general seating for groups of fans and may be reserved for special events.\\n\\nThe Coleman Co. also provided chairs, and other products to be used in the pavilions. The majority of the seating on the hill is however on grass. Fans mostly bring their own chairs or blankets to lay on. Colman Hill is known just as \"the hill\" to Shocker fans. Wichita State allows fans to bring their own beverages, food, and grills onto the hill. This provides a \"tailgate\" atmosphere. Students of Wichita state frequent Coleman Hill and often heckle the opponents outfielders. \\n\\nThe Coleman gift also resulted in improvements on the field, including installation of new artificial turf and warning track.\\n\\nThe official seating capacity of Eck Stadium is 7,851. This number counts the chairback seats behind home plate, as well as the chairback seats that line the right field line, and the metal grandstands that reside down the right field line as well. Blue \"box seats\" are closest to the action behind home plate. Followed by green and yellow seats higher up behind them, they are separated by stairs and a walkway. \\n\\nAstroTurf GameDay Grass, a modern artificial surface which closely resmebles real grass, was laid down during the summer of 2009. The Shockers held fall practice on the new turf in preparation for the 2010 season.\\n\\nThrough the 2009 season, the infield consisted of field turf with dirt pockets surrounding each base, the pitchers mound, and home plate. The grass was real and stayed constantly green and long. Eck was known for its long outfield grass as batters struggled to get doubles, with the grass slowing down balls hit in the right or left field gaps. \\n\\nThe dimensions are 335 feet down both left and right field lines and 390 to center. Winds often blow from right field to left aiding right-handed batters trying to hit home runs. \\n\\nBoth bullpens are located down the foul lines on the respective 1st and 3rd baselines. Wichita State uses the first base dugout as their own for home games, unless hosting a NCAA regional or the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament, where rules would regulate otherwise.

{"title": "Economy of Azerbaijan", "body": "Azerbaijan is an economy that has completed its post-Soviet transition into a major oil based economy (with the completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline), from one where the state played the major role. Azeri GDP grew 41.7% in the first quarter of 2007, possibly the highest of any nation worldwide.Such rates cannot be sustained, but despite reaching 26.4% in 2005 (second highest GDP growth in the world in 2005 only to Equatorial Guinea), and 2006 over 36.6% (world highest), in 2008 dropped to 11.6%.\\n\\nLarge oil reserves are a major contributor to the economy. The national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, was stable in 2000, depreciating 3.8% against the dollar. The budget deficit equaled 1.3% of GDP in 2000.\\n\\nProgress on economic reform has generally lagged behind macroeconomic stabilization. The government has undertaken regulatory reforms in some areas, including substantial opening of trade policy, but inefficient public administration in which commercial and regulatory interests are co-mingled limit the impact of these reforms. The government has largely completed privatization of agricultural lands and small and medium-sized enterprises. In August 2000, the government launched a second-stage privatization program, in which many large state enterprises will be privatized. Since 2001, the economic activity in the country is regulated by the Ministry of Economic Development of Azerbaijan Republic.\\n\\nThe following is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Azerbaijan at market prices with figures in millions of Manats.\\n\\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar was exchanged at 1,565.88 Manats only. Currently, the new Manat is in use, with an exchange rate of about 1 manat = $1.10. Mean wages were $4.79 per manhour in 2009.\\n\\nFor more than a century the backbone of the Azerbaijani economy has been petroleum, which represented 10 percent of Azerbaijan’s GDP in 2005, and is projected to double to almost 20 percent of GDP in 2007. Now that Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the Soviets because of poor technology, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important areas in the world for oil exploration and development. Proven oil reserves in the Caspian Basin, which Azerbaijan shares with Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Turkmenistan, are comparable in size to the North Sea, although exploration is still in the early stages.\\n\\nthumbAzerbaijan has concluded 21 production-sharing agreements with various oil companies. An export pipeline that transports Caspian oil to the Mediterranean from Baku through Tbilisi, Georgia to Ceyhan, Turkey (the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline) became operational in 2006. The pipeline is expected to generate as much as $160 billion in revenues for the country over the next 30 years. The recent high price of oil is highly beneficial to Azerbaijan's economy as the nation is in the midst of an oil boom. Eastern Caspian producers in cara was here Kazakhstan also have expressed interest in accessing this pipeline to transport a portion of their production. In March 2001, Azerbaijan concluded a gas agreement with Turkey, providing a future export market for Azerbaijan.\\n\\nIn 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.\\n\\nrightrightThrough the Soviet period, Azerbaijan had always been more developed industrially than Armenia and Georgia, two neighboring Transcaucasia countries - but also less diversified, as a result of slow investment in non-oil sector. With a history of industrial development of more than 100 years, Azerbaijan proved to be a leading nation in Southern Caucasus throughout the turmoil of Soviet Union collapse in early 1990s until nowadays.\\n\\nOil remains the most prominent product of Azerbaijan's economy with cotton, natural gas and agriculture products contributing to its economic growth over the last five years. More than $60 billion was invested into Azerbaijan's oil by major international oil companies in AIOC consortium operated by BP. Oil production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November 1997 and now is about 500,000 b/d. People visit petroleum spas (or \"oil spas\") to bathe in the local crude in Naftalan A leading caviar producer and exporter in the past, Azerbaijan's fishing industry today is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga in the Caspian Sea.\\n\\nAzerbaijan shares all the problems of the former Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Azerbaijan has begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while trade is building up with Turkey, Iran, UAE, and the countries of EU. Azerbaijan is also a member of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO). Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices and the location of new pipelines in the region.\\n\\nAzerbaijan faces serious environmental challenges. Soil throughout the region was contaminated by DDT and toxic defoliant used in cotton production during the Soviet era. Caspian petroleum and petrochemicals industries also have contributed to present air and water pollution problems. Several environmental organizations exist in Azerbaijan, yet few funds have been allocated to begin the necessary cleanup and prevention programs. Over-fishing by poachers is threatening the survival of Caspian sturgeon stocks, the source of most of the world's supply of caviar. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has listed as threatened all sturgeon species, including all commercial Caspian varieties. In 2007 the Blacksmith Institute listed Sumgayit as one of the ten most polluted cities in the world. According to Mercer Human Resource Consulting 2007 Worldwide Quality of Living Survey, the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, was the world's lowest-ranking city for health and sanitation; however, by 2010 Baku had pulled itself up 4 index points and its place was taken by Port-au-Prince in Haiti.\\n\\nthumbIn 2007, mining and hydrocarbon industries accounted for well over 95 per cent of the Azerbaijani economy. Diversification of the economy into manufacturing industries remain a long-term issue.\\n\\nIn 2008, Azerbaijan was cited as the top reformer by the World Bank's Doing Business report:\\n\\n21% of GDP (2008 est.)\\n\\n21.6% (2008 est.)\\n\\n12% (2008 est.)\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Economy of Gabon", "body": "Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. This has supported a sharp decline in extreme poverty; yet because of high income inequality a large proportion of the population remains poor. \\n\\nGabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP and 80% of exports. Oil production is now declining from its peak of  in 1997. The 1998 fall-off in oil prices had a negative impact on government revenues and the economy. Gabon public expenditures from the years of significant oil revenues have not been spent well.\\n\\nOverspending on the Trans-Gabon (Transgabonais) Railway, the oil price of 1986, and the franc CFA devaluation of 1994 have caused debt problems. Gabon has earned a poor reputation with the Paris Club and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for poor management of its debt and revenues. IMF missions (related to the now lapsed EFF program) have criticized the government for over-spending on off-budget items (in good years and bad), over-borrowing from the Central Bank, and slipping on the schedule for privatization and administrative reform.\\n\\nGabon's oil revenues have given it a strong per capita GDP of more than $10,000, extremely high for the region. On the other hand, a skewed income distribution and poor social indicators are evident. The economy is highly dependent on extraction of abundant primary materials. After oil, timber and manganese mining are the other major sectors. Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, manganese, and uranium exports. Foreign and Gabonese observers have consistently lamented the lack of transformation of primary materials in the Gabonese economy. Various factors have so far stymied more diversification (a small market of 1 million people, dependence on French imports, inability to capitalize on regional markets, lack of entrepreneurial zeal among the Gabonese, and the fairly regular stream of oil \"rent\"). The small processing and service sectors are largely dominated by just a few prominent local investors. \\n\\nIn 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrear on its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and private creditors. Devaluation of its CFA franc by 50% on 12 January 1994 sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year standby arrangement in 1994-1995 and a three-year Enhanced Financing Facility (EFF) at near commercial rates beginning in late 1995. Those agreements mandate progress in privatization and fiscal discipline. France provided additional financial support in January 1997 after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items, over-borrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices in 1999 helped growth, but drops in production hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains.\\n\\nAnimal husbandry is limited by the presence of the tsetse fly, though tsetse-resistant cattle have recently been imported from Senegal to a cattle project. In 2005 there were an estimated 212,000 hogs, 195,000 sheep, 90,000 goat, 35,000 head of cattle, and 3.1 million chicken. In an effort to reduce Gabon’s reliance on meat imports, the government set aside 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres) in Gabon’s unpopulated Savannah region for three ranches at Ngounie, Nyanga, and Lekabi. Currently, however, frozen imports are the most important source of beef, costing four times less than locally produced beef. Poultry production satisfies about one-half of Gabon’s consumption demand. Typical annual production of poultry amounts to 3,600 tons.\\n\\nWhile there have been recent improvements in the fishing industry, it is still relatively undeveloped. Traditional fishing accounts for two-thirds of total catch. The waters off the Gabonese coast contain large quantities of fish. Gabonese waters are estimated to be able to support an annual catch of 15,000 tons of tuna and 12,000 tons of sardines. The fishing fleet was formerly based chiefly in Libreville. A new fishing port, however, was built at Port-Gentil in 1979. Port-Gentil is now the center of operations for the industrial fleet. Plans for a cannery, fish-meal factory, and refrigerated storage facilities are underway. The total catch in 2003 was 44,855 tons, 80 percent from the Atlantic. By international agreement and Gabonese law, an exclusive economic zone extends  off the coast, which prohibits any foreign fishing company to fish in this zone without governmental authorization. However, since Gabon has no patrol boats, foreign trawlers (especially French and Spanish) often illegally capture tuna in Gabonese waters.\\n\\nGabon’s industry is centered on petroleum, manganese mining, and timber processing. Most industrial establishments are located near Libreville and Port-Gentil. Virtually all industrial enterprises were established with government subsidies in the oil boom years of the 1970s. Timber-related concerns include five veneer plants and a large 50-year-old plywood factory in Port-Gentil, along with two other small plywood factories. Other industries include textile plants, cement factories, chemical plants, breweries, shipyards, and cigarette factories. Gabonese manufacturing is highly dependent on foreign inputs, and import costs rose significantly in 1994 when the CFA franc was devalued. Increased costs and oversized capacity have made the manufacturing sector less competitive and it mainly supplies the domestic market. The government has taken steps to privatize parastatal enterprises. \\n\\nDue to the fact that the Gabonese economy is dependent upon oil (crude oil accounts for over 80% of the country’s exports, 43% of GDP, and 65% of state revenue), it is subject to worldwide price fluctuations. Gabon is sub-Saharan Africa’s third-largest crude oil producer and exporter, although there are concerns that proven reserves are declining and production has declined as well.

{"title": "Economy of Montreal", "body": "thumbthumbThe Economy of Montreal is the second of all cities in Canada and the first in Quebec. The city is today a centre of commerce, industry, technology, culture, finance, and world affairs.\\n\\nMontreal became an important centre of trade early in its history and surpassed Quebec City in importance even before its population became comparable to it. When Canada became part of the British Empire in 1763, the town was already the centre of the North American Fur Trade. Over the course of the 19th century, it grew to become the economic centre and the largest city of Canada in terms of population.\\n\\nleftBetween the end of World War II and 1971, both Montreal and Toronto grew enormously in size. Between 1941 and 1951, Montreal's population grew by 20% and Toronto's by 25%. Over the next decade, it was 35% for Montreal and 45% for Toronto. From 1961 to 1971, it was a little below 20% for Montreal and 30% for Toronto. In the early 1970s, Toronto, the metropolis of Ontario, had surpassed Montreal in population size. This was 30 years after Toronto had begun challenging Montreal as the economic capital of Canada. Indeed, the volume of stocks traded at the Toronto Stock Exchange surpassed that traded at the Montreal Stock Exchange in the 1940s. The loss of many headquarters and the departure of a large anglophone business community is nevertheless believed to have lessened Montreal's economic and social importance.\\n\\nthumbMontreal industries include aerospace, electronic goods, pharmaceuticals, printed goods, software engineering, telecommunications, textile and apparel manufacturing, tobacco and transportation. The service sector is also strong and includes civil, mechanical and process engineering, finance, higher education, and research and development. In 2002, Montreal ranked as the 4th largest centre in North America in terms of aerospace jobs.\\n\\nThe Port of Montreal is the largest inland port in the world handling 26 million tonnes of cargo annually. As one of the most important ports in Canada, it remains a trans-shipment point for grain, sugar, petroleum products, machinery, and consumer goods. For this reason, Montreal is the railway hub of Canada and has always been an extremely important rail city; it is home to the headquarters of the Canadian National Railway, and was home to the headquarters of the Canadian Pacific Railway until 1995.\\n\\nThe headquarters of the Canadian Space Agency are located in Longueuil, southeast of Montreal. Montreal also hosts the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO, a United Nations body); the World Anti-Doping Agency (an Olympic body); the International Air Transport Association (IATA); and the International Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (IGLCC), as well as some 60 other international organizations in various fields.\\n\\nIn 2006 Montreal was named a UNESCO City of Design, only one of three design capitals of the world (with the others being Berlin and Buenos Aires). This distinguished title recognizes Montreal's design community. Since 2005 the city has also been home for the International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda); the International Design Alliance (IDA).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nMontreal is also a centre of film and television production. The headquarters of Alliance Films and five studios of the Academy Award-winning documentary producer National Film Board of Canada can be found here, as well as the head offices of Telefilm Canada, the national feature-length film and television funding agency. Given its eclectic architecture and broad availability of film services and crew members, Montreal is a popular filming location for feature-length films, and sometimes stands in for European locations. The city is also home to many recognized cultural, film and music festivals (Just For Laughs, Montreal Jazz Festival, and others), which contribute significantly to its economy. It is also home to one of the world's largest cultural enterprises, the Cirque du Soleil.\\n\\nThe video game industry is also booming in Montreal since 1997, coinciding with the opening of Ubisoft Montreal. Recently, the city has attracted world leading game developers and publishers studios such as Ubisoft, EA, Eidos Interactive, Artificial Mind and Movement, Bioware, and Strategy First, mainly because video games jobs have been heavily subsidized by the provincial government. Every year, this industry generates billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in the Montreal area.\\n\\nSeveral companies are headquartered in Greater Montreal including ACE Aviation, Rio Tinto Alcan, Desjardins Group, Bombardier Inc., Canadian National Railway, CGI Group, Air Canada, Air Transat, CAE, Saputo, Cirque du Soleil, Quebecor, Power Corporation, Bell Canada,. SNC-Lavalin, Hydro-Québec, AbitibiBowater, Laurentian Bank, Pratt and Whitney Canada, Molson, Tembec, Alimentation Couche-Tard, MEGA Brands, National Bank of Canada, Transat A.T., VIA Rail, and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.\\n\\nPrior to its dissolution, the airline Jetsgo was headquartered in Montreal.\\n\\nGreater Montreal had a GDP of $120 billion in 2005, placing it 39th in the world.

{"title": "Economy of Svalbard", "body": "thumbThe economy of Svalbard is dominated by coal mining, tourism and research. In 2007, there were 484 people working in the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of , tourism NOK 317 million and research 142 million. In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK 494,700, or 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing is owned by the various employers and institutions and rented to their employers; there are only a few privately-owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution. The Spitsbergen Treaty and Svalbard Act established Svalbard as a economic free zone and demilitarized zone in 1925.\\n\\nThe Spitsbergen Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago. The islands are, unlike the Norwegian Antarctic Territory, part of the Kingdom of Norway and not a dependency. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the Svalbard Act. All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of providing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Svalbard has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax. There is a separate budget for Svalbard to ensure compliance. Svalbard is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. Norwegian military activity is limited to fisheries surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard. The treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment.\\n\\nSince the resettlement of Svalbard in the early 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter uses 35% of its output to power the power station in Longyearbyen. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There have previously been performed test drilling for petroleum on land, but these did not give satisfactory results for permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as natural reserves or national parks.\\n\\nthumbSvalbard has historically been a base for both whaling and fishing. Norway claimed a  exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Svalbard in 1977, with  of internal waters and  of EEZ. Norway retains a restrictive fisheries policy in the zone, and the claims are disputed by Russia.\\n\\nTourism is centered around the vast nature and is centered around Longyearbyen. Activities include hiking, kayaking, walks through glacier caves and snow-scooter and dog-sled safari. Cruise ships generate a significant portion of the traffic, including both stops by offshore vessels and expeditionary cruises starting and ending in Svalbard. Traffic is strongly concentrated between March and August; overnights have quintupled from 1991 to 2008, when there were 93,000 guest-nights.\\n\\nResearch on Svalbard centers around Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, the most accessible areas in the high Arctic. Norway grants permission for any nation to conduct research on Svalbard, resulting in the Polish Polar Station and the Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station. The University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) in Longyearbyen was established in 1993 and offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate courses to 350 students. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a \"doomsday\" seedbank to store seeds from as many of the world's crop varieties and their botanical wild relatives as possible. A cooperation between the Government of Norway and the Global Crop Diversity Trust, the vault is cut into rock near Longyearbyen, keeping it at a natural  and refrigerating the seeds to . The Svalbard Undersea Cable System is a  fibre optic lines from Svalbard to Harstad, needed for communicating with polar orbit satellite stations on Svalbard.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nWithin Longyearbyen there is a road system, but it does not connect with any other settlements. The town does have a bus system, Off-road motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter—both for commercial and recreational activities. Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg () and Pyramiden () is possible by snowmobile by winter, or by ship all year round.\\n\\nSvalbard Airport, Longyear, located  from Longyearbyen, is the only airport offering air transport off the archipelago. Scandinavian Airlines has daily scheduled services to Tromsø and Oslo; there are also irregular charter services to Russia. Lufttransport provides regular corporate charter services from Longyearbyen to Ny-Ålesund Airport and Svea Airport for Kings Bay and Store Norske. There are heliport in Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and helicopters are frequently used by the governor and to a less extent Arktikugol.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Economy of the Confederate States of America", "body": "The Confederate States of America had an agrarian-based economy that relied heavily on slave-worked plantations for the production of cotton for export to Europe and the northern US states. If ranked as an independent nation, it would have been the fourth richest country of the world in 1860. When the Union blockaded its ports in summer 1861, exports of cotton fell 95 percent and the South had to restructure itself to emphasize food production and munitions production. After losing control of its main rivers and ports, it had to depend on a rickety railroad system that, with few repairs, no new equipment and federal raids, crumbled away. The financial infrastructure collapsed during the war as inflation destroyed banks and forced a move toward a barter economy for civilians. The government seized needed supplies and livestock (paying with certificates that were supposed to be paid off after the war, but never were.) By 1865 the economy was in ruins.\\n\\nThe main agricultural products of the Confederate States were cotton, tobacco, and sugar cane, with some cattle and much grain. In 1862, there was a severe drought that, despite efforts to switch from cotton planting to grain farming, caused food shortages and even bread riots in the winter of 1862 and spring of 1863. The harvests in the Confederate States were fairly abundant after 1862, but often went to waste as they could not be harvested or moved to markets. Corn was raised in large quantities, and, in general, the raising of food products instead of tobacco and cotton was encouraged by legislation and otherwise.\\n\\nThe scarcity of food in the armies and cities was due mostly to the shortage of male labor caused by conscription, the disruption of transportation and finance, and the fact that important regions farmland were turned into battlefields, where armies from both sides quickly expropriated all available food and animals. Compounding the problem was the ever-increasing number of refugees flooding into cities; food distribution became increasingly harder, and at times, impossible. \\n\\nThe progressive destruction of the southern railroad network, along with rapid inflation, hit women in the cities especially hard as they found food prices to be too high to afford. This could be seen in the infamous Richmond bread riots of April, 1863, when a large mob of starving women in the city looted stores for food, ignoring the pleas of President Jefferson Davis who stood upon a cart to address the mob, and only dispersed when he threatened for a company of militia to open fire. This and other stories of hardship on the home front greatly demoralized Confederate soldiers when they received letters from their wives, and hence \"thousands of husbands discharged themselves\" to save their families over the course of the war. \\n\\nDespite the Confederacy's strength in cotton production, it produced very little wool for winter clothing, and by the end of the first year, its most productive regions were in the hands of the Union. Instead it was mostly reliant upon foreign sources. The planting of opium, required for morphine and other derivative medicines, was encouraged but did not yield significant quantities.\\n\\nThe Confederacy's industrial workforce, like its agricultural workforce, was characterized by its wide and extensive use of slaves. In the 1850s, anywhere from 150,000 - 200,000 slaves were used in industrial work. Most, almost 4/5, were owned directly by industrial owners, the other being bonded out by plantation owners. Often, manual labor performed by slaves would be combined with skilled white artisans in order to better compete with northern and foreign industry.\\n\\nDespite the profitability of slave industry, Southern industry had been undercapitalized for years by the time of the outbreak of the war. Besides a social preference for ownership of real property, agriculture in staple goods was considered the easiest route to profitability; thus agriculture always outbid industry when it came to capital allocation. As early as 1830, Southern industry was a generation behind, and by the Civil War, was vastly inferior to northern and foreign manufacturing.\\n\\nAt the outset of hostilities, only two government-owned naval yards were located in the South. Of private shipyards, anywhere from 36-145 existed, of varying tonnage and skill. While sawmills were readily available to supply the construction of wooden boats, iron processing in the South was limited.\\n\\nIn the initial volleys of the war, the Confederate government sought the use of cottage and home-based industry to fulfill manufacture of finished textile goods, such as shirts and shoes. Finding this method of production inadequate, the government moved to consolidate finished-goods production into military-run textile shops concentrated in larger cities. These textile shops, with the exception of those captured or destroyed, continued to run until the end of the war. Private mills generally supplied raw textiles to these shops for refinement.\\n\\nProtected from northern and European imports by the blockade, however, privately-owned textile mills found themselves in a very lucrative market. Ever-rising prices due to scarcity and high-levels of demand made sales to the public far more profitable than fixed-price contract sales to the military. So much so, that in the first year private mills often refused or cut back on fulfillments ordered by Confederate quartermasters. The advent of conscription, giving the government de-facto control over the labor force, as well as control over railroads and other forms of transport, precluded such avoidance.\\n\\nWhile the general political sentiment in the Confederacy was reluctance towards government involvement in private business, the exigencies of the war forced the Confederate government to exert a strong control over industry related to war aims. The bureau of conscription, empowered by the conscription act of 1862 and 1863, dispensed exemptions to those in industry, if necessary, provided a powerful incentive to private industry to fulfill government contracts. If an owner refused, they would find themselves quickly without their labor force, free or slave.\\n\\nBefore the war the South had a good system of transportation by riverboats on a huge network of navigable rivers, plus a dozen ocean ports. In May 1861 the Union naval blockade shut down almost all port activity except for blockade runners. International and coastal traffic fell 90 percent or more. In peacetime, the vast system of navigable rivers allowed for cheap and easy transportation of farm products. The vast geography made for difficult Union logistics, and Union soldiers were used to garrison captured areas and protect rail lines. But the Union Navy seized most of the navigable rivers by 1862, making its own logistics easy and Confederate movements difficult. After the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863, it became impossible for units to cross the Mississippi since Union gunboats constantly patrolled it. The Eastern and Western portions of the Confederacy were never reconnected.\\n\\nThe outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the Confederate railroad industry. With cotton crop being hoarded in an attempt to entice European intervention, railroads were bereft of their main source of income. Many were forced to lay off employees, and in particular, let go skilled technicians and engineers. For the early years of the war, the Confederate government had a hands off approach to the railroads. It wasn't until mid-1863 that the Confederate government initiated an overall policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort. With the legislation of impressment the same year, rail roads and their rolling stock, came under the defacto control of the military.\\n\\nIn the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system was always on the verge of collapse. The impressment policy of Quarter-master's ran the rails ragged; feeder lines would be scraped in order to lay down replacement steel for trunk lines, and the continual use of rolling stock wore them down faster than they could be replaced.\\n\\nthumbThe states that entered the Confederate States accounted for 70 percent of total US exports, and the Confederate leaders believed that this would give the new nation a firm financial basis. Cotton was the primary potential export, accounting for 75 percent of Southern goods either shipped to northern US states or exported in 1860. The Confederate States entered the war with the hope that its near monopoly of the world cotton trade would force the European importing countries, especially Great Britain and France, to intervene in the war on her behalf. In 1861, Southerners at the local level imposed an embargo on cotton shipments — it was not the government's policy. Millions of bales of cotton went unshipped, and by summer 1861 the blockade closed down all normal trade.\\n\\nA small fraction of the cotton was exported through blockade runners. In the total course of the war, 446,000 bales of cotton were exported to England and Europe. Ironically, the largest amount of cotton exports went to the United States. Most cotton however, would never be traded during the Confederacy's brief existence, either being destroyed during the war or hoarded till the end.\\n\\nDisputes over the proper tariff rate had been a sectional political issue between northern and southern states at one point almost leading to a prior dissolution of the Union. Southerners mostly opposed protectionist tariffs for finished goods, fearing they would lessen the value of their raw material exports, as foreign manufactures would be blocked sale back to the United States. Southern political pressure kept the tariffs at low levels from 1847 through 1860. The founders of the Confederate States codified this opposition in the Confederate States Constitution with a prohibition of protectionist tariffs. One of the first acts of the Confederate Congress was the lowering of import tariffs from the then current US average rate of 20 percent to 10 percent.\\n\\nHowever the Confederacy proposed to impose its tariffs on all imports from the USA, which would have been a vast increase in taxes for the Southerners. In practise almost no tariffs were collected; the total customs revenue collected was about $3.3 million (Confederate dollars), from 1861 through 1864. [Historical Statistics (2006) series Eh201]\\n\\nJust as the blockade had made export of Confederate goods prohibitive, so did it frustrate the importation of vital goods to the Confederate war-effort. Importers often had to use transshipment points, such as ports in the Caribbean, transferring and splitting cargo onto smaller ships for the final leg. Thus shipments became sporadic and delayed.\\n\\nIn the immediate aftermath of Fort Sumter, agents, headed by Major Caleb Huse, were sent abroad to Europe to procure weapons and other necessary supplies. Despite these efforts, the first shipment did not leave England until August, and didn't arrive in the South till November, a full 8 months after the outbreak of hostilities. The slow rate of importation continued from September 1861 to February 1862, with a grand total of 15,000 small arms procured for the Confederate's war effort.\\n\\nAfter February, however, the Confederacy's fortunes in weapons procurement changed dramatically. From April 1862 till August of that year, the Confederacy was able to procure some 48,150 arms, over three times the amount gained in the same period the year before. By February 1863, the total number of guns purchased had raised to a total of 174,129.. While some of these weapons were caught by the Union navy in the blockade, a slight majority made it through, with 40.9 percent of all privateers being caught in 1862.\\n\\nRaw minerals that the South was bereft of were acquired through trade with Mexico, most notably sulphur, copper, powder, and niter. Union officials recognized the extent of trade with Mexico, and aggressively tried to interrupt it. Despite their efforts, and the fall of the Mississippi into Union hands, flow of goods from Mexico to the Confederacy was unabated until the end of the war.\\n\\nWhile attempts were made to engage shipbuilders on the Pacific coast, in an attempt to access ports in South America, none of the plans came to fruition. Only the Confederate steamer, the Alabama, after finding the Atlantic too hostile, set sail for Pacific waters in an attempt to wreck America's Far-East trade. Though it succeeded in its mission to harass American trade interests, it did not manage to open new ports or engage in trade for the Confederacy, and it was sunk before it could return home with its captured goods.\\n\\nBlockade runners who sold to the public dealt almost exclusively in luxury and other high-profit items, despite the ever-present need for staple goods. The practice was so egregious that the Confederate congress came to ban the import of luxury items, though the law was not effectively enforced. Smuggling over land, from either Mexico or Union territory, also provided a profitable trade in luxury items, though it also become a useful means of acquiring much-needed medicine.\\n\\nThe specie holdings of the banks largely found their way into the Confederate treasury in payment for a $15,000,000 loan effected early in 1861. In addition, the government secured the specie in the various Federal offices which fell into its power. These sums were soon sent to Europe in payment of foreign war supplies. The gold and silver in general circulation also soon left the CSA almost entirely, driven out by the rising flood of paper money. Aside from the payment of the above loan, the government never secured any specie revenue, and was driven headlong into the wholesale issue of paper money. The first notes were issued in March 1861, and bore interest. They were soon followed by others, bearing no interest and payable in two years, others payable six months after peace. New issues were continually provided, so that from an initial $1,000,000 in circulation in July 1861, the amount rose to $30 million before December 1861; to $100 million by March 1862; to $200 million by August 1862; to perhaps $450 million by December 1862; to $700 million by the autumn of 1863; and to a much larger figure before the end of the war.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThis policy of issuing irredeemable paper money was copied by the individual states and other political bodies. Alabama began by issuing $1,000,000 in notes in February 1861, and added to this amount during each subsequent session of the state legislature. The other states followed suit. Cities also sought to replenish their treasuries in the same way. Corporations and other business concerns tried to meet the rising tide of prices with the issue of their individual promissory notes intended to circulate from hand to hand. \\n\\nAs a result of this redundancy of the currency, its value collapsed. Gold was quoted at a premium in Confederate notes in April 1861. By the end of that year, a paper dollar was quoted at 90 cents in gold; during 1862 that figure fell to 40 cents; during 1863, to 6 cents; and still lower during the last two years of the war. The downward course of this figure, with occasional recoveries, reflects the popular estimate of the Confederacy’s chance of winning independence. \\n\\nThe oversupply of currency drove the price of commodities to exorbitant heights, and disarranged all business. Savings in nominal dollars lost 90 percent or more of their value. It affected different classes of commodities differently. Imports like coffee became very expensive, and ersatz substitutes were found. (Massey 1952) Confederate asset price stabilization policies appear to have increased the velocity of circulation, and counterproductively channeled inflationary pressures into other areas of the economy. Three successive monetary reform encouraged holders of treasury notes to exchange these notes for bonds by imposing deadlines on their convertibility. Confederate legislative efforts aimed at precipitating the conversion of currency into bonds did temporarily suppress currency depreciation. These acts also triggered upsurges in commodity prices, however, because note holders rushed to spend the currency before their exchange rights were reduced.\\n\\nSpeculators were continually abused for importing high-priced luxuries instead of confining themselves to supplying the government with foreign war supplies. Tobacco and cotton, which found few foreign buyers owing to the blockade, actually fell in value as quoted in gold. The great divergence of the price of these two commodities in the CSA and abroad — the New York price of cotton increased more than tenfold during the war — offered the strongest inducement to evade the blockade and export them. A small amount of cotton reached the world market by way of the Atlantic ports or Mexico, and netted those concerned in the venture handsome profits. By 1862, Treasury agents from Washington were buying cotton, offering very large sums for planters willing to do business with the enemy. Tobacco and cotton were smuggled through the military lines in exchange for hospital stores, coffee and similar articles. The military authorities tried to suppress this illicit trade, but at times even they were carried away by the desire to secure the much-desired foreign supplies.\\n\\nThe disturbances of prices, their local differences and fluctuations, produced wild speculation in the Confederate States. Normal business was almost impossible, and a gambling element was forced into every transaction. Speculation in gold was especially pronounced. Legislation and popular feeling were aimed at it, but without avail. Even the government itself was compelled to speculate in gold. Speculation in food and other articles was equally inevitable and was much decried. Laws were formed to curb the speculators, but had no effect.\\n\\nThe policy of the Confederate banks during the war encouraged speculation. The New Orleans banks had been well managed, and remained solvent until September 1861. The banks of the other states suspended specie payments at the end of 1860, and thereafter enlarged their note issue and their loans, thereby adding to the general redundancy of the currency and stimulating the prevalent speculative craze. They did a large business by speculating in cotton, making advances to the planters on the basis of their crops. The state governments also used their note issues for this purpose, the planters urgently demanding relief as their cotton could not reach a market. The Confederate government also made advances on cotton and secured large quantities by purchase, to serve as the basis of cotton bonds. The rise in prices which reflected the redundancy of the currency was no advantage to the producer. Frequent efforts were made by legislation and otherwise to reduce the prices demanded, especially by the agriculturists. As a result, the production of food products fell off, or at least the agriculturists did not bring their products to market for fear of being forced to sell them at a loss. Supplies for the army were obtained by impressment, the price to be paid for them being arbitrarily fixed at a low figure. As a result, the army administration found it almost impossible to induce producers of food willingly to turn over their products, and the army suffered from want. Under these confused industrial circumstances, the sufferings of the debtor class were loudly asserted, and laws were passed to relieve them of their burdens, making the collection of debts difficult or impossible. The debts of Southerners to Northerners contracted before the war were confiscated by the Confederate government, but did not amount to a large figure.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of the Union blockade and the peculiar industrial development of the Confederate States removed the possibility of an ample government revenue. Though import duties were levied, the proceeds amounted to almost nothing. A small export duty on cotton was expected to produce a large revenue sufficient to base a loan upon, but the small amount of cotton exports reduced this source of revenue to an insignificant figure. There being, moreover, no manufactures to tax under an internal revenue system such as the US government adopted, the Confederacy was cut off from deriving any considerable revenue from indirect taxation. The first Confederate tax law levied a direct tax of twenty million dollars, which was apportioned among the states. These, with the exception of Texas, contributed their apportioned share to the central government by issuing bonds or notes, so that the tax was in reality but a disguised form of loan. Real taxation was postponed until the spring of 1863, when a stringent measure was adopted taxing property and earnings. It was slowly and with difficulty put into effect, and was re-enacted in February 1864. In the states and cities there was a strong tendency to relax or postpone taxation in view of the other demands upon the people.\\n\\nWith no revenue from taxation, and with the disastrous effects of the wholesale issue of paper money before it, the Confederate government made every effort to borrow money by issuing bonds. The initial $15 million loan was soon followed by an issue of one hundred million in bonds, which it was, however, difficult to place. This was followed by even larger loans. The bonds rapidly fell in value, and were quoted during the war at approximately the value of the paper money, in which medium they were paid for by subscribers. To avoid this circumstance, a system of produce loans was devised by which the bonds were subscribed for in cotton, tobacco and food products. This policy was subsequently enlarged, and enabled the government to secure at least a part of the armies' food supplies. But the bulk of the subscriptions for these bonds was made in cotton, for which the planters were thus enabled to find a market.\\n\\nIt was hoped to keep the currency within bounds by holders of paper money exchanging it for bonds, which the law allowed and encouraged, but as notes and bonds fell in value simultaneously, there was no inducement for holders to make that exchange. On the contrary, a note-holder had an advantage over a bond-holder, in that he could use his currency for speculation or for purchases in general. In the autumn of 1862, the Confederate law attempted to compel note-holders to fund their notes in bonds, in order to reduce the redundancy of the currency and lower prices. Disappointed in the result of this legislation, the Congress, in February 1864, went much farther in the same direction by passing a law requiring note-holders to fund their notes before a certain date, after which notes would be taxed a third or more of their face value. This drastic measure was accepted as meaning a partial repudiation of the Confederate debt, and though it for a time reduced the currency outstanding and lowered prices, it wrecked the government's credit, and made it impossible for the Treasury to float any more loans. During the last months of the war, the Treasury led a most precarious existence, and its actual operations can only be surmised.\\n\\nDuring the entire war the notion that the CSA possessed a most efficient engine of war in its monopoly of cotton (the \"King Cotton\" idea) buoyed up the hopes of the Confederates. The government strained every effort to secure recognition of the Confederacy as a nation by the great powers of Europe (see Cotton diplomacy). It also more successfully secured individual foreigners' financial recognition of the Confederate States by effecting a foreign loan based on cotton. This favorite notion was put into practice in the spring of 1863. The French banking house of Erlanger &amp; Company undertook to float a loan of $3,000,000, redeemable after the war in cotton at the rate of sixpence a pound. As cotton at the time was selling at nearly four times that figure, and would presumably be quoted far above sixpence long after the establishment of peace, the bonds offered strong attractions to those speculatively inclined and in sympathy with the Confederate cause. The placing of the bonds in Europe was mismanaged by the Confederate agents, but notwithstanding, a considerable sum was secured from the public and used for the purchase of naval and military stores. At the close of the war, these foreign bonds were ignored by the re-established Federal authorities like all the other bonds of the Confederate government, or of state governments under the Confederacy.\\n\\nEven though the Fourteenth Amendment forbade any redemption of such bonds, there continued to be a speculative market for Confederate Bonds in Europe into the twentieth century (a similar situation would recur with Czarist Russian Bonds) as it was hoped that at some point, political or economic pressure could be brought to bear to assure at least partial redemption of such bonds. The market died out finally about the time of World War I, when it became clear those circumstances were not likely to occur.\\n\\nall data sets are in Historical Statistics of the United States: Millennial Edition Online (2006) available in academic libraries. \\n\\nA significant amount of available capital in the confederate states was invested in slaves; this high level of investment discouraged slave-owners and the \"Slave\" States in general from showing much interest in the abolition of slavery. Compounding the problem for Confederates was the lack of any high level of industry in the south, leading many to fear that the removal of slavery (and thus the removal of capital) would destroy the economy of the Southern States.\\n\\n*America, Confederate States\\n\\n"}

The term seems to have been first used by G. Tyler Miller, Jr. in the 1975 edition of his Living in the Environment text. The 1990 book Coming of Age in the Global Village sought to quantify an \"ecoshare\" by linking it to average world per capita income and energy use. A more modern approach might extend this by also including one's carbon footprint.

{"title": "Ecosystem", "body": "thumbthumbAn ecosystem is a biological environment consisting of all the organisms living in a particular area, as well as all the nonliving, physical components of the environment with which the organisms interact, such as air, soil, water, and sunlight. It is all the organisms in a given area, along with the nonliving (abiotic) factors with which they interact; a biological community and its physical environment.\\n\\nThe entire array of organisms inhabiting a particular ecosystem is called a community. In a typical ecosystem, plant and other photosynthetic organism are the producers that provide the food. Ecosystems can be permanent or temporary. Ecosystems usually form a number of food web.\\n\\nEcosystems are functional units consisting of living things in a given area, non-living chemical and physical factors of their environment, linked together through nutrient cycle and energy flow.\\n\\nCentral to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organism interact with every other element in their local environment. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: \"Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the \"community\") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.\"\\n\\nThe term ecosystem was coined in 1930 by Roy Clapham to mean the combined physical and biological components of an environment. British ecologist Arthur Tansley later refined the term, describing it as \"The whole system, … including not only the organism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment\". Tansley regarded ecosystems not simply as natural units, but as mental isolates. Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term ecotope.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nBiome are a classification of globally similar areas, including ecosystems, such as ecological communities of plant and animal, soil organisms and climatic conditions. Biomes are in part defined based on factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna) and climate. Unlike ecozone, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation.\\n\\nA fundamental classification of biomes is:\\n\\nthumbthumbthumb\\n\\nEcosystems have become particularly important politically, since the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) - ratified by 192 countries - defines \"the protection of ecosystems, natural habitats and the maintenance of viable populations of species in natural surroundings\" as a commitment of ratifying countries. This has created the political necessity to spatially identify ecosystems and somehow distinguish among them. The CBD defines an \"ecosystem\" as a \"dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit\".\\n\\nWith the need of protecting ecosystems, the political need arose to describe and identify them efficiently. Vreugdenhil et al. argued that this could be achieved most effectively by using a physiognomic-ecological classification system, as ecosystems are easily recognizable in the field as well as on satellite images. They argued that the structure and seasonality of the associated vegetation, or flora, complemented with ecological data (such as elevation, humidity, and drainage), are each determining modifiers that separate partially distinct sets of species. This is true not only for plant species, but also for species of animals, fungi and bacteria. The degree of ecosystem distinction is subject to the physiognomic modifiers that can be identified on an image and/or in the field. Where necessary, specific fauna elements can be added, such as seasonal concentrations of animals and the distribution of coral reef.\\n\\nSeveral physiognomic-ecological classification systems are available:\\n\\nSeveral aquatic classification systems are available, and an effort is being made by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN) to design a complete ecosystem classification system that will cover both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.\\n\\nFrom a philosophy of science perspective, ecosystems are not discrete units of nature that simply can be identified using the most \"correct\" type of classification approach. In agreement with the definition by Tansley (\"mental isolates\"), any attempt to delineate or classify ecosystems should be explicit about the observer/analyst input in the classification including its normative rationale.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nEcosystem services are “fundamental life-support services upon which human civilization depends,” and can be direct or indirect. Examples of direct ecosystem services are: pollination, wood and erosion prevention. Indirect services could be considered climate moderation, nutrient cycle and detoxifying natural substances.\\n\\nThe services and goods an ecosystem provides are often undervalued as many of them are without market value. Broad examples include:\\n\\nEcuador's new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature, or ecosystem rights.\\n\\nThe borough of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania passed a law giving ecosystems legal rights. The ordinance establishes that the municipal government or any Tamaqua resident can file a lawsuit on behalf of the local ecosystem. Other townships, such as Rush, followed suit and passed their own laws.\\n\\nThis is part of a growing body of legal opinion proposing 'wild law'. Wild law, a term coined by Cormac Cullinan (a lawyer based in South Africa), would cover birds and animals, rivers and deserts.\\n\\nthumbthumb\\n\\nFrom an anthropocentric point of view, some people perceive ecosystems as production units that produce goods and services, such as wood by forest ecosystems and grass for cattle by natural grasslands. Meat from wild animals, often referred to as bush meat in Africa, has proven to be extremely successful under well-controlled management schemes in South Africa and Kenya. Much less successful has been the discovery and commercialization of substances of wild organism for pharmaceutical purposes. Services derived from ecosystems are referred to as ecosystem services. They may include\\n\\nA greater degree of species or biological diversity - commonly referred to as Biodiversity - of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem, because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus \"absorb\" or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure is fundamentally changed to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level: Humid tropical forests produce very few goods and direct services and are extremely vulnerable to change, while many temperate forests readily grow back to their previous state of development within a lifetime after felling or a forest fire. Some grasslands have been sustainably exploited for thousands of years (Mongolia, Africa, European peat and mooreland communities).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumbIntroduction of new elements, whether biotic or abiotic, into an ecosystem tend to have a disruptive effect. In some cases, this can lead to ecological collapse or \"trophic cascading\" and the death of many species within the ecosystem. Under this deterministic vision, the abstract notion of ecological health attempts to measure the robustness and recovery capacity for an ecosystem; i.e. how far the ecosystem is away from its steady state.\\n\\nOften, however, ecosystems have the ability to rebound from a disruptive agent. The difference between collapse or a gentle rebound is determined by two factors—the toxicity of the introduced element and the resiliency of the original ecosystem.\\n\\nEcosystems are primarily governed by stochastic (chance) events, the reactions these events provoke on non-living materials and the responses by organisms to the conditions surrounding them. Thus, an ecosystem results from the sum of individual responses of organisms to stimuli from elements in the environment.The presence or absence of populations merely depends on reproductive and dispersal success, and population levels fluctuate in response to stochastic events. As the number of species in an ecosystem is higher, the number of stimuli is also higher. Since the beginning of life organisms have survived continuous change through natural selection of successful feeding, reproductive and dispersal behavior. Through natural selection the planet's species have continuously adapted to change through variation in their biological composition and distribution. Mathematically it can be demonstrated that greater numbers of different interacting factors tend to dampen fluctuations in each of the individual factors.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nGiven the great diversity among organisms on earth, most ecosystems only changed very gradually, as some species would disappear while others would move in. Locally, sub-populations continuously go extinct, to be replaced later through dispersal of other sub-populations. Stochastists do recognize that certain intrinsic regulating mechanisms occur in nature. Feedback and response mechanisms at the species level regulate population levels, most notably through territorial behaviour. Andrewatha and Birch suggest that territorial behaviour tends to keep populations at levels where food supply is not a limiting factor. Hence, stochastists see territorial behaviour as a regulatory mechanism at the species level but not at the ecosystem level. Thus, in their vision, ecosystems are not regulated by feedback and response mechanisms from the ecosystem itself and there is no such thing as a balance of nature.\\n\\nIf ecosystems are governed primarily by stochastic processes, through which its subsequent state would be determined by both predictable and random actions, they may be more resilient to sudden change than each species individually. In the absence of a balance of nature, the species composition of ecosystems would undergo shifts that would depend on the nature of the change, but entire ecological collapse would probably be infrequent events.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe theoretical ecologist Robert Ulanowicz has used information theory tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing mutual information (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow, and eutrophication.\\n\\nIn addition, Eric Sanderson has developed the Muir web, based on experience on the Mannahatta project. This graphical schematic shows how different species are connected to each other, not only regarding their position in the food chain, but also regarding other services, i.e. provisioning of shelter, ...\\n\\nEcosystem ecology is the integrated study of biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This science examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as chemical, bedrock, soil, plant, and animal. Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structure and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact.\\n\\nthumbthumb\\n\\n"}

At the time of his graduation, he was Michigan's all-time leader in rushing attempts (532) and ranked third in rushing yards (2,333 yards). \\n\\nAfter graduating from Michigan, Shuttlesworth played for the Toronto Argonauts in 1974 and 1975. With 866 rushing yards in his rookie year, he was the third leading rusher in the Canadian Football League.\\n\\nA native of Ohio, Shuttlesworth attended Woodward High School in Cincinnati, Ohio.\\n\\nShuttlesworth enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1970.\\n\\nAs a sophomore, Shuttlesworth made his debut with the 1971 Michigan Wolverines football team that finished the regular season with an undefeated 11–0 record. Shuttlesworth began the season as a backup fullback, playing as a substitute for Fritz Seyferth. \\n\\nIn the second game of the season, a 56-0 win over Virginia, Shuttlesworth led the team with 107 rushing yards on 16 carries for an average of 6.7 yards per carry. He also scored his first college touchdown in the Virginia game. After the game, Larry Paladino, for the Associated Press, described Shuttlesworth as \"a bruising, 235-pound, second string fullback.\"\\n\\nIn a game against Minnesota in late October, Shuttlesworth outgained starting fullback Seyferth by 96 yards to 25 yards. Two weeks later, Shuttlesworth got his first start in a 63–7 win over Iowa, Michigan's highest point total since 1947. In the Iowa game, Shuttlesworth rushed for 112 yards (86 yards in the first quarter) and three touchdowns on only 16 carries for an average of 7.0 yards per carry. \\n\\nOne week after the Iowa game, Shuttlesworth was named UPI Midwest Back of the Week after rushing for 125 yards and three touchdowns against Purdue. After the Purdue game, the UPI noted that the Michigan Gridiron Guide described Shuttlesworth as having \"tremendous raw potential.\" The UPI concluded that Coach Schembechler had \"turned that raw potential into running might.\"\\n\\nPlaying against Stanford in the 1972 Rose Bowl, Shuttlesworth made a key play on kick coverage, hitting Stanford's Jim Ferguson at the two-yard line and knocking him back into the end zone for a safety. The safety gave Michigan a 12-10 lead, but Stanford kicked a late field goal to win by a score of 13-12.\\n\\nShuttlesworth gained 877 yards and scored six touchdowns on 182 carries in 1971 for an average of 4.8 yards per carry. He was the team's second leading rusher behind Billy Taylor (1,297 yards).\\n\\nAs a junior, Shuttlesworth again began the season as a backup (to Bob Thornbladh), but won the starting job in the second game of the year. Shuttlesworth was the starting fullback in eight games for the 1972 team that finished with a record of 10–1. As in 1971, Shuttlesworth had three games in which he rushed for more than 100 yards. Early in the season, he reached the 1,000-yard milestone in career rushing, hitting the mark sooner than any player in Wolverine history. \\n\\nShuttlesworth had the best game of his career against 18th ranked Tulane on September 30, 1972, rushing for 151 yards and scoring three touchdowns on 20 carries for an average of 7.5 yards per carry. After the Tulane game, the Associated Press called Shuttlesworth \"the human bulldozer,\" and Shuttlesworth told reporters:Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler added, \"We're trying to get Shuttlesworth to lift his legs more in the secondary. He is potentially a breakaway runner and he can go all the way.\"\\n\\nLater in the year, Shuttlesworth gained only 86 yards but scored a career-high four touchdowns against Minnesota. He scored all four touchdowns in the first half on runs of less than four yards or less. He was Michigan's leading rusher in 1972 with 716 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on 157 carries for an average of 4.5 yards per carry.\\n\\nAs a senior, Shuttlesworth started all 11 games at fullback for the undefeated 1973 Michigan Wolverines football team that finished the season with a 10–0–1 record. For the second straight year, he was Michigan's leading rusher. He accumulated 746 rushing yards and nine touchdowns on 193 carries for an average of 3.9 yards per carry. In his final game for Michigan, Shuttlesworth rushed for 116 yards in a 10–10 tie with Ohio State. After the Ohio State game, Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler told reporters, \"We had a great fullback in there today. That man Shuttlesworth really ran. He came to play.\"\\n\\nIn January 1974, Shuttlesworth played for the East All-Stars in the Hula Bowl. Bo Schembechler coached the East All-Stars and called on Shuttlesworth to carry the ball 22 times. Shuttlesworth, who led the East team to a victory with his 86 rushing yards, told the press after the game, \"I don't mind doing all that work. It's my job.\"\\n\\nIn three years at Michigan, Shuttlesworth gained 2,333 rushing yards and 26 touchdowns on 532 carries for an average of 4.4 yards per carry. He had seven 100-yard rushing games and seven games in which he scored multiple touchdowns. At the time of his graduation, he ranked first in rushing attempts and third in rushing yards at Michigan. His rushing yardage trailed only Ron Johnson (2,417 yards) and Billy Taylor (3,072 yards).\\n\\nShuttlesworth was selected by the Baltimore Colts in the second round (37th overall pick) of the 1974 NFL Draft. He opted instead to play for the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League. He signed a three-year contract with the Argonauts in March 1974. In April 1974, a Maryland sports columnist expressed dismay at the Colts' inability to sign Shuttlesworth:In 1974, he was the third leading rusher in the CFL with 866 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 191 carries for an average of 4.5 yards per carry. In 1975, he gained 101 rushing yards on 21 carries for an average of 4.8 yards per carry.\\n\\nIn 1976, Shuttlesworth played with the Baltimore Colts during the pre-season. He did not play with the Colts during the regular season. In 1977, Shuttlesworth attended training camp with the Philadelphia Eagles and scored on a 30-yard touchdown run in an exhibition game against the Washington Redskins. However, he was waived by the Eagles in early August 1977 and did not make the regular season lineup.\\n\\nAfter retiring from football, Shuttlesworth became a computer software professional working in the Atlanta area.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eddie Tolan", "body": "Thomas Edward \"Eddie\" Tolan (September 29, 1908 – January 30/31, 1967), nicknamed the \"Midnight Express\", was an American track and field athlete who compete in the Sprint. He set world records in the 100 yard dash and 100 meters event and Olympic records in the 100 meters and 200 meters events. He was the first Afro-American to receive the title of the \"world's fastest human\" after winning gold medal in the 100 and 200 meters events at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In March 1935, Tolan won the 75, 100 and 220 yard events at the World Professional Sprint Championships in Melbourne, Australia to become the first man to win both the amateur and professional world sprint championships. In his full career as a sprinter, Tolan won 300 races and lost only 7.\\n\\nTolan was born in Denver, Colorado, one of four children. Tolan's father was Thomas Tolan. The family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah when Tolan was young, and moved again to Detroit, Michigan in 1924, when Tolan was 15 years old. Tolan later recalled, \"My father read about better opportunities for Negroes here, so he packed up Mom and the four kids and we came here.\"\\n\\nTolan attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit where he was an outstanding football player and sprinter. While at Cass Tech, Tolan set state records in the 100 and 220 yard dashes. While still in high school, Tolan ran the 100 yard dash in 9.8 seconds and the 220 yard dash in 21.5 seconds. At age of 16, Tolan was a member of a two-man team from Cass Tech that won the 1925 National Interscholastic indoor meet in Chicago. He won his first sprint double at the state meet as a sophomore, and in 1927 he won the 100 and 220 yard dashes at the National Interscholastic Championship at Soldier Field in Chicago. Despite his accomplishments as a sprinter, Tolan's first love was football, and he often said \"the six touchdowns he scored in one game as a 131-pound quarterback at Detroit’s Cass Tech High School was his greatest thrill, rather than his double win in the Olympics.\"\\n\\nTolan was recruited by several major universities as a football player, but he chose the University of Michigan. There are differing accounts as to why Tolan never played on the varsity football team at Michigan. According to a published account in The Detroit News in 2002, Tolan joined the freshman football team as a freshman in 1927. At that time, no African-American had played on Michigan's varsity football team since George Jewett in the 1890s. Tolan was initially allowed to play, but on the third day of practice, the freshman football coach told him, \"Some of the coaches are disagreeing on your chances. Some of them think that you shouldn’t be allowed to play football. I'd be tickled to have you but I'm afraid I'm going to be outvoted.\" The Detroit News noted, that the freshman coach was outvoted: \"They took away Eddie Tolan’s football uniform and handed him a track suit in exchange.\"\\n\\nOther accounts indicate, it was an injury that prevented Tolan from playing football at Michigan. An Associated Press story on Tolan in 1958 stated: \"He would have been a football great as a quarterback, had a knee injury in his junior year in high school not forced him to channel all his energies to track.\" In his obituary, the Associated Press reported that the coaches at Michigan \"talked the pint-sized speedster into going out for track.\" Tolan was also quoted as saying, \"The track team did a lot more traveling then, so I saw the opportunity to travel on a Pullman and see the country.\"\\n\\nthumbAt Michigan, Tolan ran track under the mentorship of two of the great sprinters of their generations. Michigan's head coach, Steve Farrell, was considered the \"the greatest professional footracer this country has ever known\" in the 1880s and 1890s. And Michigan’s assistant coach Charles B. Hoyt, who took over from Farrell in 1930, was rated \"America’s best sprinter\" in 1913, but lost his opportunity to compete in the 1916 Olympics due to World War I.\\n\\nAs a sophomore in May 1929, Tolan broke the Big Ten Conference record and tied the world’s record for the 100 yard dash with a time of 9.6. Press coverage starting with this world record run, and throughout his career, focused on three features – Tolan's race, his eyeglasses, and his short stocky build. Tolan was one of the first African-Americans to have success in sprinting, and he raced with eyeglasses taped to his head. Various accounts put his height anywhere from 5 feet, 4 inches, to 5 feet, 7 inches. One writer noted that Tolan \"looks like a church deacon.\" Another writer described Tolan’s appearance this way:Tolan’s gum-chewing became part of his routine. He chewed gum before a race to relieve stress. After accidentally running with the gum in his mouth, Tolan found that he was chewing in sync with his stride. Tolan later began chewing gum as part of his routine, chewing the gum faster when he needed to accelerate his leg movements.\\n\\nAt the Big Ten championships in May 1930, Tolan broke the world's record in the 100 yard dash with a time of 9.5. Tolan's performance was accepted by the International Amateur Athletic Federation as the new official world’s record.\\n\\nSeven weeks after breaking the world's record in the 100 yard dash, Tolan also broke the world's record in the 100 meters race. Competing in Vancouver, British Columbia, Tolan shaved two-tenths of a second off the record with a time of 10-1/5 seconds. Track officials in Vancouver announced after the race, that Tolan’s record-setting performance was \"all the more remarkable in the fact that he ran uphill, the finish mark being thirty inches higher than the starting point.\" \\n\\nTolan's world-record performances in 1930 brought him international fame, as he became known as the \"Midnight Express.\" In May 1931, Tolan again broke the world’s record in the 100 meters event with a time of 10.3 seconds in Vancouver. Southern California sprinter Frank Wykoff jumped to a slight lead, but Tolan came from behind to pass Wykoff at the 100 yard mark.\\n\\nTolan graduated from the University of Michigan in 1931.\\n\\nthumbAfter graduating from Michigan, Tolan enrolled at West Virginia State College, where he did \"graduate work preparatory to teaching and coaching at a Negro institution.\" Early in 1932, Tolan was not running at his prior level. Despite the slow start, Dean Cromwell, Chairman of the All American Board of Track and Field, predicted great things for Tolan in his column on 1932’s \"Olympic Prospects.\" Cromwell wrote of Tolan:While press reports regularly referred to Tolan as \"stocky,\" Cromwell took issue with that characterization:The Olympic trials were held at Stanford University, and Ralph Metcalfe won both the 100 and 200 meters finals, with Tolan finishing second to Metcalfe in each case. The results meant that the top two American sprinters in the 1932 Olympics would for the first time be African-Americans. As a result, much of the press attention focused on race. Los Angeles Times sports columnist Braven Dyer wrote: \"Metcalfe and Tolan make the ace of spades look positively pale by comparison … But how these boys can run … And they figure to do even better here than they did at Palo Alto because it's warmer now and they enjoy the heat.\"\\n\\nThe 100 meters contest at the 1932 Olympics was one of the closest races in Olympic history. Tolan broke the Olympic record in the first heat of the second round with a time of 10.4 seconds, but Metcalfe remained the favorite. In the finals, Japan sprinter Takiashi Yoshioka jumped out to a four-yard lead after 40 meters. Tolan passed Yoshioka at the 6 -meter mark and had a two-yard lead over Metcalfe at the 100 yard mark. But Metcalfe passed Tolan at the tape and appeared to the crowd to be the winner. Sports writer Maxwell Stiles described the last strides as follows:It was hours later, after review of films taken with a \"Kirby two-eyed camera,\" that officials were able to declare Tolan the winner with a time of 10.3 seconds. The films showed that Tolan and Metcalfe hit the finish line in a dead heat, but Tolan was declared the winner, because he had his entire torso past the line on the ground before Metcalfe. \\n\\nthumbThe 200 meters race was held on the fourth day of competition, and this time the race was not close, as Tolan beat Metcalfe easily with an Olympic record time of 21.2 seconds – four-tenths of a second better than the prior record of 21.6 seconds. Tolan stumbled slightly with three yards to go, but righted himself and finished with a four-foot lead. With double wins in the 100 and 200 meters contests, Tolan was dubbed the \"world’s fastest human.\" Tolan was the first African-American to have that distinction, and press coverage of his Olympic wins focused on his race. The Associated Press called him the \"spectacled little American Negro\" and \"the dusky little thunderbolt.\" Braven Dyer referred to him as \"the stubby colored boy,\" and noted that \"the chunky Detroit Negro\" had defeated Arthur Jonath of Germany, \"the white-skinned Teuton.\" Another writer described how the \"little black man with horn-rimmed glasses\" crossed the finish line, being chased by \"a white man of America, George Simpson,\" and \"a brother black, Ralph Metcalfe.\"\\n\\nCommentators also noted, that the only other two sprinters to win double gold in the 100 and 200 meters races were also University of Michigan athletes, Ralph Craig and Archie Hahn.\\n\\nAfter the sprint competition concluded, a reporter interviewed Tolan and Metcalfe in their shared room at the Olympic Village. When Metcalfe teased Tolan for being lucky, Tolan replied, \"Yeah, I had it all right – but it's 'bout time, Ralph; first little ol' luck I had in eight years!\" Still in bed at noon wearing pajamas and with a stocking cap on his head, Tolan said he was \"in the best condition of my life when the 200 meters final started,\" and he vowed to give his gold medals to his mother.\\n\\nBack in Detroit, Mayor Frank Murphy appointed a reception committee to meet Tolan at the train station, and Michigan Governor Wilbur M. Brucker declared September 6, 1932 as \"Eddie Tolan Day\" throughout the state. The governor issued a proclamation stating that Tolan had \"brought honor to our commonwealth\" and encouraging communities throughout the state to arrange ceremonies \"as an expression of Michigan's pride in his achievement.\"\\n\\nTolan's mother noted, that she was proud of her son's accomplishments. She noted that, though she had worked hard as the sole provider for the family, it was worth it. She added, \"If my menfolk could only find jobs I could ease up a bit and a mighty big worry would be off Eddie's mind.\"\\n\\nthumbLess than six months after winning Olympic gold medals and the title of the \"world’s fastest human,\" Tolan garnered national press when he fell on hard times. Syndicated columnist William H. Beatty wrote that \"the heady wine of victory has turned overnight to vinegar\" for Tolan. Tolan noted that, when he was met at the train station by a welcoming committee, his half-brother was collecting waste paper in the grass of the park in front of the train station. Tolan noted that his half-brother was \"luckier than I am,\" because he had a job. His parents had both been unemployed for many months, and it was not until January 1933 that Tolan was able to get a low-paying job as a filing clerk in a county office. Tolan’s lifetime dream of becoming a physician was waning, as he had been \"unable to make enough to support himself and his parents.\"\\n\\nDesperate to earn a living, Tolan \"walked the streets of many cities, seeking work,\" and even briefly appeared in vaudeville in 1932 with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson. They made a good team; Tolan had set world records for running forwards, and Robinson had set world's records for running backwards: 50 yards backward sprint (6 seconds), 75 yards backwards sprint (8.2 seconds), and 100 yards backwards sprint (13.2 seconds).\\n\\nBecause of his brief appearance in vaudeville, the Michigan Amateur Athletic Association stripped Tolan of his amateur status in June 1933. And in April 1934, Tolan’s bad luck continued as an automobile he was driving stuck and seriously injured an 80-year-old pedestrian.\\n\\nIn November 1934, Tolan took a leave of absence from his job as assistant county registrar of deeds to compete in the Australia sprint program, a series of five professional races, including the Stawell Gift handicap. Tolan returned in April 1935 after having set new Australian records of 21.5 seconds in the 220-yard dash on a full curve track and 7.5 seconds for the 75-yard dash. He won the 75, 100, and 220 yard events at the World Professional Sprint Championships in March 1935 in Melbourne, and became the first man to win both the amateur and professional world sprint championships.\\n\\nIn his full career as a sprinter, Tolan won 300 races and lost only 7. Throughout his career as a sprinter, Tolan worked by a simple creed: \"Start fast, run easily, stay in your lane and finish strong.\"\\n\\nAfter returning from Australia, Tolan returned to his job in Detroit as a clerk to the Register of Deeds. Tolan worked at a variety of jobs in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1956, Tolan became a school teacher in physical and health education. He taught at the Irving Elementary School on Detroit’s West Side for several years.\\n\\nTolan never married. In 1965, Tolan's kidneys failed, and he was required to undergo weekly dialysis treatments for the rest of his life. In 1967, Tolan died from heart failure at age 58 at Detroit's Mt. Carmel Hospital, while undergoing one of his weekly treatments. At the time of his death, Jesse Owens paid him tribute in Jet magazine:Tolan was survived by his sisters, June Brown and Martha Lombard, and a brother, Hart H. Tolan. Though the two never met, Tolan was also a cousin of former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan. Eddie Tolan is interred at United Memorial Gardens in Plymouth, Michigan.\\n\\nIn 1958, Tolan was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. He was one of the first 18 persons inducted. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1980. Only 17 individuals were inducted into the Hall before Tolan.\\n\\nTolan was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African Americans.\\n\\nEddie Tolan was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1982. \\n\\n"}

In 1914, she married chemical engineer Ervin Renyi - by whom she had a son, who would later die in a fascist labour camp - but divorced him in 1918. Through her uncle, she began to learn about psychoanalysis and attended the 5th International Psychoanalytical Congress in Budapest. From 1918 onwards she participated in gatherings of the Sunday Circle, a group of left-wing intellectuals which included psychoanalyst Rene Spitz. In 1919, she worked for the Commissariat for Education during the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic. \\n\\nWhen the republic fell following the Romanian invasion, she fled to Vienna, where she supported herself by working at a parachute factory, and then as a sales assistant at a bookshop. She knew the Hungarian writers Bela Balazs, composer Hans Eisler, Czech writer Egon Erwin Kisch and Hermann Broch - who translated her poetry into German. Thereafter she was for short periods in Czechoslovakia and Romania. After being expelled from Romania for her communism, she settled in Berlin in 1923, with her second husband Laszlo Tolgy (Gluck). She designed costumes for the films of Elisabeth Bergner at the Neumann Produktion film studio, translated, interpreted and took photographs. She also worked on the staff of the Rote Hilfe newspaper of the German Communist Party for a time. She studied psychoanalysis from 1924 onwards and later practised it.\\n\\nWhen Hitler came to power in 1933, Gyömrői emigrated to Prague.

He was then appointed as a lecturer at the University of Leeds in 1924, and became a professor of theoretical physics their in 1939. He did some early work in astrophysics and computed a limit for the mass of white dwarf stars in 1930.

This and some other pieces of small merit secured for him distinguished patronage in the society ridiculed by Molière in the Ecole des femmes. Boursault was persuaded that the Lysidas of that play was a caricature of himself, and attacked Molière in Le Portrait du peintre ou la contre-critique de l'Ecole des femmes (1663). Molière retaliated in L'Impromptu de Versailles, and Boileau attacked Boursault in Satires 7 and 9. Boursault replied to Boileau in his Satire des satires (1669), but was afterwards reconciled with him, when Boileau on his side erased his name from his satires.\\n\\nBoursault obtained a considerable pension as editor of a rhyming gazette, which was, however, suppressed for ridiculing a Capuchin friar, and the editor was only saved from the Bastille by the interposition of Condé. In 1671 he produced a work of edification in Ad usum Delphini: la veritable étude des souverains, which so pleased the court that its author was about to be made assistant tutor to the dauphin when it was found that he was ignorant of Greek and Latin, and the post was given to Pierre Huet. Perhaps in compensation Boursault was made collector of taxes at Montlucon about 1672, an appointment that he retained until 1688.\\n\\nAmong his best-known plays are Le Mercure galant, the title of which was changed to La Comédie sans titre (\"Play without a title\") (1683) when the publisher of the literary review of the same name objected (see \"Mercure de France\"); La Princesse de Clêves (1676), an unsuccessful play which, when refurbished with fresh names by its author, succeeded as Germanicus; Esope à la ville (1690); and Esope à la cour (1701). His lack of dramatic instinct could hardly be better indicated than by the scheme of his Esope, which allows the fabulist to come on the stage in each scene and recite a fable. Boursault died in Paris on the 15th of September 1701.\\n\\nThe Œuvres choisies of Boursault were published in 1811, and a sketch of him is to be found in M.

At one point, she was known as one of America's wealthiest and best dressed performers. She was married to Edwin Stacey of Cincinnati, Ohio, and later Nat C. Goodwin.\\n\\nThe daughter of Nellie Goodrich and A.S. Stevens, Edna was raised by her great-grandfather, Abner Scott Thornton, a member of the influential Logansport Thorntons. His brothers included Dr. William Patton Thornton, a noted physician; Henry Clay Thornton, a prominent lawyer and father of Sir Henry Worth Thornton; and Dr. Joseph Lyle Thornton, a respected educator and manufacturer. Judge William Wheeler Thornton was his nephew. Among his influential cousins were Military Reconstruction Judge James Johnston Thornton and Hon. Samuel W. Thornton, a member of the 1887 Nebraska State Legislature.\\n\\nHer grandfather, Justus Goodrich, died in an insane asylum in Kankakee, Illinois on June 3, 1896. He long suffered from mental illness, derived from sunstroke received on the march to the Battle of Gettysburg. During the battle, on July 2, 1863, he was shot in the heel.\\n\\nUpon reaching her maturity, Edna and her mother moved to New York City, where both found work as chorus girls. Edna Goodrich joined the cast of the Florodora musical, as one of the famed sextets, all of whom were extremely beautiful, 5'4\", and 130 lbs. Out of more than 70 women who became a Florodora girl, Edna was one of a handful who achieved lasting fame.\\n\\nIt was as a sextet that Edna Goodrich became involved in the Harry Kendall Thaw murder trial, which was labeled Trial of the Century by William Randolph Hearst's newspapers. Thaw killed architect Stanford White during a performance at Madison Square Garden over Mr. White's relationship to Evelyn Nesbit. It was reported that Edna Goodrich had introduced fellow Floradora chorus girl Nesbit and White during an intimate meeting in White's apartment. Edna Goodrich was served with several subpoenas during the trial, reportedly tearing one apart in front of the serving agent. She denied any knowledge of the affair.\\n\\nAfter leaving Floradora, Edna Goodrich became the leading lady of the Nat C. Goodwin comedic productions. Mr. Goodwin was the most famous American comedian of his era and scion of a mining family that had made millions. Their performances played to packed theaters across the United States and Europe, making both fodder for early news sensationalism.\\n\\nIn 1908 Goodrich and Goodwin became involved in a confusing sequence of events and news reports that would lead to their marriage. First, the press linked Edna with millionaire James H. McMillan; however, as the marriage date was continuously postponed, rumors began to circulate of discord. Edna affirmed the engagement and then took off for Europe on a $20,000 spending spree. Afraid of losing Edna, Nat Goodwin sailed to Europe to convince her that Mr. McMillanwas actually poor. He hired private investigators to tail Ms. Goodrich; She hired private investigators to stay one step ahead of his investigators. This chase across Europe so unsettled Mr. McMillan that he asked Edna if she would not rather marry immediately in Switzerland. She said that she wanted to marry in her own country and set sail for the United States with her purchases. Surprisingly, within short order, the wedding was called off- the press attributed this change to Mr. McMillan's mother who had refused her consent after hearing of Edna Goodrich's involvement in the divorce of Nat Goodwin from his third wife, Maxine Elliott. The press later reported that Ms. Elliot became engaged to Mr. McMillan.\\n\\nIn the fall of 1908, Nat C. Goodwin and Edna Goodrich were married. The bride reportedly wore more than $60,000 worth of jewelry Also, Nat and Edna signed a prenuptial agreement, entitling her to half of his estate and an income for life. At first, the press believed the amount conferred to be $400,000, but later, during divorce proceedings, it was revealed that the amount totaled more than $1.7 million.\\n\\nBy the summer of 1910, the press began to circulate rumors of the Goodwins' impending separation amid rumors over Nat Goodwin's flirtation with another actress This began a two year press and court battle over the terms of the prenuptial trust, with both Goodrich and Goodwin filing repeated suits against one another. The official divorce was granted in New York, with the judge allowing Ms. Goodrich to once again use her maiden name and barring Mr. Goodwin from ever marrying in the state again.\\n\\nFrom 1914 to August 1915, Edna Goodrich served as a nurse of World War I wounded for the British Army. Her cottage was later turned into a convalescent home for soldiers returning from the front. Her mother's cousin, Sir Henry Worth Thornton, was the highest ranking American-born officer in the British Army.\\n\\nFor the rest of the decade, Edna worked in theater and appeared in several movies of the Silent Screen, although she never captured the same degree of success as she enjoyed on stage. Also, she reportedly developed an alcohol addiction that caused her to be fired on the set of \"The Golden Chance (1915)\" by Cecil B. DeMille.\\n\\nEdna Goodrich retired from making films in 1918.\\n\\nBroadway:\\n\\n"}

In 1990, he received his Ph.D. in mathematics from The University of Texas at Austin. He did his postdoctoral work at the University of Waterloo in Canada.While currently a math professor, it is known that in the late 1980s Burger was an 'independent contractor' writer for Jay Leno.\\n\\nHis research interests include algebraic number theory, Diophantine analysis, ''p''-adic analysis, geometry of numbers, and the theory of continued fraction. He teaches abstract algebra, \"The Art of Creating Mathematics\", and Diophantine analysis. He has taught or been a visiting scholar at The University of Texas at Austin, Westminster College, James Madison University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, Baylor University, and the Macquarie University in Australia.\\n\\nEdward Burger is a pioneer in rich, multimedia Internet lectures that, together with written material, form an electronic textbook.

Teachers are performers in front of an audience. Some teachers don't realize they have to reach their audience.\"\\n\\nHe offers his students \"challenging questions for which the solution is by no means apparent\". For example, when teaching students about topology, he asked students if it is \"possible to take a cord of rope  long and tie it snugly around your right ankle and your left ankle, take off your pants, turn them inside out, and put your pants back on without ever cutting the rope?\" He proceeded to demonstrate the solution to that challenge, wearing huge Boston Red Sox boxer shorts under his trousers, at the Boston Public Library in the summer of 2005. Failure is closely tied to creativity:\\n\\n\"As a professor, I'm basically performing three times a week. I like to be funny and to make my students laugh,\" he said. In addition to his math courses, Burger teaches a short course in comedy writing during the winter study program at Williams. Combining math with comedy comes from his days as a stand-up comic at the Laff Stop Comedy Club in Austin in the late-1980s.\\n\\nBurger states that \"mathematics is basically an approach to solving difficult problems. The techniques and strategies that we can learn in mathematics are techniques and strategies we can use to solve any difficult problem.\" In the textbook he co-authored with Michael Starbird, The Heart of Mathematics, they offer their favorite top ten mathematical ways of thinking:\\n\\nBurger has written 12 books and has had more than 30 papers published in scholarly journals. With Michael Starbird, he coauthored ''The Heart of Mathematics: An invitation to effective thinking'', for which they won a 2001 Robert W. Hamilton Book Award, and Coincidences, Chaos, and All That Math Jazz,, a humorous look at mathematics filed under both math and humor in the Library of Congress catalog.

{"title": "Edward Hincks", "body": "thumbthumbThe Reverend Edward Hincks (August 19, 1792 – December 3, 1866) was an Irish clergyman, best remembered as an Assyriologist and one of the decipherers of Mesopotamian cuneiform.\\n\\nEdward Hincks was born in Cork on 19 August 1792. He was the eldest son of Thomas Dix Hincks a distinguished Protestant minister, orientalist and naturalist. He was also the brother of Francis Hincks a Canadian politician. Hincks was educated at home by his father and later at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating in 1811 at the age of 19. In 1825, after taking orders in the Church of Ireland, he was appointed rector of Killyleagh in County Down, an office he was to hold for the remaining forty-one years of his life.\\n\\nThe undemanding nature of his clerical duties left him with more than enough time to pursue his interest in ancient languages. His first love was for the hieroglyphic writing of ancient Egypt. By 1823 the Frenchman Jean-Francois Champollion had succeeded in deciphering this enigmatic script, but Hincks made a number of discoveries of his own which established him as an authority of ancient philology.\\n\\nIn the 1830s he turned his attention to Old Persian cuneiform, a form of writing that the emperors of Persia had used for monumental inscriptions in their own language. Working independently of the leading Orientalist of the day Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, Hincks deduced the essentially syllabic nature of this script and correctly deduced the values of the Persian vowels.\\n\\nIn 1835 he supervised the unrolling of the mummified body of Takabuti at the Belfast Natural History Society. Hincks deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs, which revealed that she was mistress of a great house.\\n\\nHincks’ greatest achievement was the decipherment of the ancient language and writing of Babylon and Assyria: Akkadian cuneiform. But his attention might never have been drawn to the relatively new topic of Assyriology had it not been for a lucky find during 1842.\\n\\nDuring that year the archaeologist Paul Émile Botta uncovered the remains of the ancient city of Niniveh, the capital of the Assyrian Empire. Among the treasures unearthed by Botta and his successors was the famous library of Assurbanipal, a royal archive containing tens of thousands of baked clay tablets. These tablets were inscribed in a strange illegible form of writing known as cuneiform. Three men were to play a decisive role in the decipherment of this script: Hincks, Rawlinson and a young German-born scholar called Jules Oppert.\\n\\nHincks deduced correctly that cuneiform writing had been invented by one of the earliest civilizations of Mesopotamia (a people later identified by Oppert as the Sumerians), who then bequeathed it to later states such as Babylon, Assyria and Elam.\\n\\nBy 1850 Hincks had come to a number of important conclusions regarding the nature of Assyro-Babylonian cuneiform. He believed that the script was essentially syllabic, comprising open syllables (e.g. \"ab\" or \"ki\") as well as more complex closed syllables (e.g. \"mur\"). He also discovered that cuneiform characters were \"polyphonic,\" by which he meant that a single sign could have several different readings depending on the context in which it occurred.\\n\\nBy now Hincks had recognized a large number of determinative and had correctly established their readings. But not everyone was convinced by the claims being made by the Irishman and his distinguished colleagues. Some philologists even suggested that they were simply inventing multiple readings of the signs to suit their own translations.\\n\\nIn 1857 the versatile English Orientalist William Henry Fox Talbot suggested that an undeciphered cuneiform text be given to several different Assyriologists to translate. If, working independently of one another, they came up with reasonably similar translations; it would surely dispel the doubts surrounding their claims.\\n\\nAs it happened, Talbot and the \"holy trinity of cuneiform\", - Hincks, Rawlinson and Oppert, were in London in 1857. Edwin Norris, secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, gave each of them a copy of a recently discovered inscription from the reign of the Assyrian emperor Tiglath-Pileser I. A jury of experts was empanelled to examine the resulting translations and assess their accuracy.\\n\\nIn all essential points the translations produced by the four scholars were found to be in close agreement with one another. There were of course some slight discrepancies. The inexperienced Talbot had made a number of mistakes, and Oppert’s translation contained a few doubtful passages due to his unfamiliarity with the English language. But Hincks’ and Rawlinson’s versions were virtually identical. The jury declared itself satisfied, and the decipherment of cuneiform was adjudged a fait accompli.\\n\\nThe Reverend Edward Hincks devoted the remaining years of his life to the study of cuneiform and made further significant contributions to its decipherment. He died at his rectory in Killyleagh on 3 December 1866 at the age of 74. He was survived by a wife and four daughters.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Edward Lear", "body": "Edward Lear (12 May 1812 – 29 January 1888) was an English artist, illustrator, author, and poet, renowned today primarily for his literary nonsense, in poetry and prose, and especially his limericks, a form that he popularised.\\n\\nLear was born into a middle-class family in the village of Holloway, the 21st child of Ann and Jeremiah Lear. He was raised by his eldest sister, also named Ann, 21 years his senior. Ann doted on Lear and continued to mother him until her death, when Lear was almost 50 years of age. Due to the family's failing financial fortune, at age four he and his sister had to leave the family home and set up house together. \\n\\nLear suffered from health problems. From the age of six he suffered frequent grand mal epileptic seizure, and bronchitis, asthma, and in later life, partial blindness. Lear experienced his first seizure at a fair near Highgate with his father. The event scared and embarrassed him. Lear felt lifelong guilt and shame for his epileptic condition. His adult diaries indicate that he always sensed the onset of a seizure in time to remove himself from public view. How Lear was able to anticipate them is not known, but many people with epilepsy report a ringing in their ears or an \"aura\" before the onset of a seizure. In Lear's time epilepsy was believed to be associated with demonic possession, which contributed to his feelings of guilt and loneliness. When Lear was about seven he began to show signs of depression, possibly due to the constant instability of his childhood. He suffered from periods of severe depression which he referred to as \"the Morbids.\" thumb\\n\\nLear travelled widely throughout his life and eventually settled in Sanremo, on his beloved Mediterranean coast, in the 1870s, at a villa he named \"Villa Tennyson.\" The closest he came to marriage was two proposals, both to the same woman 46 years his junior, which were not accepted. For companions he relied instead on a circle of friends and correspondents, and especially, in later life, on his Suliot chef, Giorgis, a faithful friend and, as Lear complained, a thoroughly unsatisfactory chef. Another trusted companion in Sanremo was his cat, Foss, who died in 1886 and was buried with some ceremony in a garden at Villa Tennyson. After a long decline in his health, Lear died at his villa in 1888, of the heart disease from which he had suffered since at least 1870. Lear's funeral was said to be a sad, lonely affair by the wife of Dr. Hassall, Lear's physician, not one of Lear's many lifelong friends being able to attend.\\n\\nLear is buried in the Foce Cemetery in Sanremo. On his headstone are inscribed these lines from Tennyson's To E.L. [Edward Lear], On His Travels in Greece:\\n\\n  ... all things fair.  With such a pencil, such a pen.  You shadow forth to distant men,  I read and felt that I was there.\\n\\nthumbLear was already drawing \"for bread and cheese\" by the time he was aged 16 and soon developed into a serious \"ornithological draughtsman\" employed by the Zoological Society and then from 1832-36 by the Earl of Derby, who had a private menagerie. His first publication, published when he was 19, was Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots in 1830. His paintings were well received and he was favourably compared with Audubon. \\n\\nLear travelled for three years in Italy from 1837 and published two volumes of illustrations, Illustrated Excursions in Italy, the first of many such books. Lear briefly gave drawing lessons to Queen Victoria, who had been pleased by the Excursions and summoned him to court, leading to some awkward incidents when he failed to observe proper court protocol. Lear then returned to the Mediterranean, wishing to illustrate all points along the coast of that sea. Among other trips, he visited Greece and Egypt in 1848-49, and toured the length of India and Ceylon in 1873-75. While travelling he produced large quantities of coloured wash drawings in a distinctive style, which he worked up back in his studio into oils and watercolour, as well as prints for his books. His landscape style often shows views with strong sunlight, with intense contrasts of colour. \\n\\nThroughout his life he continued to paint seriously. He had a lifelong ambition to illustrate Tennyson's poems; near the end of his life a volume with a small number of illustrations was published, but his vision for the work was never realized.\\n\\nthumbIn 1846 Lear published A Book of Nonsense, a volume of limericks that went through three editions and helped popularize the form. In 1865 The History of the Seven Families of the Lake Pipple-Popple was published, and in 1867 his most famous piece of nonsense, The Owl and the Pussycat, which he wrote for the children of his patron Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. Many other works followed.\\n\\nLear's nonsense books were quite popular during his lifetime, but a rumour circulated that \"Edward Lear\" was merely a pseudonym, and the books' true author was the man to whom Lear had dedicated the works, his patron the Earl of Derby. Supporters of this rumour offered as evidence the facts that both men were named Edward, and that \"Lear\" is an anagram of \"Earl\".\\n\\nLear's nonsense works are distinguished by a facility of verbal invention and a poet's delight in the sounds of words, both real and imaginary. A stuffed rhinoceros becomes a \"diaphanous doorscraper\". A \"blue Boss-Woss\" plunges into \"a perpendicular, spicular, orbicular, quadrangular, circular depth of soft mud\". His heroes are Quangle-Wangles, Pobbles, and Jumblies. His most famous piece of verbal invention, a \"runcible spoon\" occurs in the closing lines of The Owl and the Pussycat, and is now found in many English dictionaries: thumb\\n\\n  They dined on mince, and slices of quince    Which they ate with a runcible spoon;  And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,    They danced by the light of the moon,      The moon,      The moon,  They danced by the light of the moon.\\n\\nThough famous for his neologisms, Lear employed a number of other devices in his works in order to defy reader expectations. For example, \"Cold Are The Crabs\", adheres to the sonnet tradition until the dramatically foreshortened last line.\\n\\nLimericks are invariably typeset as four plus one lines today, but Lear's limericks were published in a variety of formats. It appears that Lear wrote them in manuscript in as many lines as there was room for beneath the picture. In the first three editions most are typeset as, respectively, two, five, and three lines. The cover of one edition bears an entire limerick typeset in two lines:\\n\\n  There was an Old Derry down Derry, who loved to see little folks merry;  So he made them a book, and with laughter they shook at the fun of that Derry down Derry.\\n\\nIn Lear's limericks the first and last lines usually end with the same word rather than rhyming. For the most part they are truly nonsensical and devoid of any punch line or point. They are completely free of the off-colour humour with which the verse form is now associated. A typical thematic element is the presence of a callous and critical \"they\". An example of a typical Lear limerick:\\n\\n  There was an Old Man of Aôsta,  Who possessed a large Cow, but he lost her;  But they said, 'Don't you see,  she has rushed up a tree?  You invidious Old Man of Aôsta!'\\n\\nLear's self-portrait in verse, How Pleasant to know Mr. Lear, closes with this stanza, a reference to his own mortality:\\n\\n  He reads but he cannot speak Spanish,    He cannot abide ginger-beer;  Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,    How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!\\n\\nFive of Lear's limericks from the Book of Nonsense, in the 1946 Italian translation by Carlo Izzo, were set to music for choir a cappella by Goffredo Petrassi, in 1952.\\n\\n"}

From 1812 to 1832, he was Member of Parliament for Staffordshire and then was the MP for the southern division of that county until 1835. He spent most of that time as a Canningite Tory, but moved over to the Whigs after George Canning's death in 1827. In the House of Commons, Littleton was especially prominent as an advocate of Roman Catholic emancipation. In January 1833, against his own wish, he was put forward by the Radicals as a candidate for the office of speaker, but he was not elected. \\n\\nIn May 1833 he became chief secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the ministry of Earl Grey. His duties in this capacity brought him frequently into conflict with Daniel O'Connell. He had to deal with the difficult question of the Irish tithes on which the government was divided, and with his colleagues had to face the problem of a new coercion act. Rather hastily he made a compact with O'Connell on the assumption that the new act could not contain certain clauses which were part of the old act. The clauses, however, were inserted; O'Connell charged Littleton with deception; and in July 1834 Grey, Viscount Althorp and the Irish secretary resigned. The two latter were induced to serve under the new premier, Lord Melbourne, and they remained in office until Melbourne was dismissed in November 1834. In 1835 Littleton was raised to the peerage as Baron Hatherton, of Hatherton in the County of Stafford. He later served as Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire between 1854 and 1863.\\n\\nLord Hatherton married Hyacinthe Mary Wellesley, eldest illegitimate daughter of Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, in October 1812. He died at his Staffordshire residence, Teddesley Hall, in May 1863, aged 72, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Edward.\\n\\nHatherton, Edward Littleton, 1st BaronHatherton, Edward Littleton, 1st BaronHatherton, Edward Littleton, 1st BaronHatherton, Edward Littleton, 1st Baron\\n\\n"}

A significant part of the Battle of Gettysburg's first day fighting occurred on property owned by McPherson, known thereafter as McPherson's Ridge.\\n\\nMcPherson was born in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and attended the common schools. He graduated from Pennsylvania College as valedictorian in 1848 and studied law and botany. After passing the bar exam, he joined the practice of Thaddeus Stevens in Lancaster and came to share Stevens' political views as a Whig. Falling ill, McPherson left the law practice and moved to Harrisburg, where he briefly edited the Harrisburg American in 1851. He returned to Lancaster to edit the Independent Whig from 1851–54, and the Pittsburgh Daily Times in 1855. He moved back to Gettysburg in 1856 and resumed his legal career. His father died in 1858 and willed him a large farm two miles west of town along the Chambersburg Turnpike.\\n\\nThat same year, McPherson was nominated to represent Pennsylvania's 17th District in the United States House of Representatives. He was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh Congresses, serving from 1859 through March 1863. He was a member of the Republican National Committee in 1860. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1862 to the Thirty-eighth Congress when his district was expanded to include Somerset County, a moderate region opposed to McPherson's Radical Republican views. President Abraham Lincoln appointed McPherson as Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue in 1863.\\n\\nOn June 30, 1863, Union cavalry under John Buford camped on the large farm inherited by McPherson west of Gettysburg in Cumberland Township. The following day, Buford's men stubbornly held the ridgeline against Confederate infantry until reinforcements arrived, including the famed Iron Brigade. Fighting raged on McPherson's farm for much of the day, with thousands of men wounded or injured in the vicinity. The battle ruined the crops and pastures of McPherson's tenant farmer, John Slentz, and caused considerable damage to fences, buildings, property and supplies, for which McPherson was never compensated. McPherson sold the farm in 1868. The National Park Service bought the property in 1904 and now maintains the McPherson barn, which still stands on the Gettysburg National Military Park.\\n\\nRep. Thaddeus Stevens used his considerable influence to have his protégé McPherson appointed as Clerk of the House of Representatives, a position he held from December 8, 1863, to December 5, 1875. He authored a pair of books, Political History of the United States of America During the Great Rebellion (1864) and The Political History of the United States of America During the Period of Reconstruction (1871). \\n\\nMcPherson presided over the Republican National Convention in 1876. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed him as Director of the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing in 1877 and 1878. Returning to the newspaper business, he was editor of the Philadelphia Press from 1877 until 1880. He also served as editor of the New York Tribune Almanac from 1877–1895 and was editor and proprietor of a newspaper in Gettysburg from 1880 until 1895. He was the American editor of the Almanach de Gotha. \\n\\nHe again served as Clerk of the House of Representatives from December 1881 to December 1883 and for a third time from December 1889 to December 1891. He died four years later in Gettysburg, and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery.\\n\\nHe and his wife Annie Crawford McPherson were married in 1862 and had four sons and a daughter.\\n\\n"}

He apprenticed in Newcastle upon Tyne with John Dobson, who worked in a classicising, Italianate manner; he then worked under Sir George Gilbert Scott (1854–59) during the restoration of Durham Cathedral's tower, taking a break in 1858 for \"extensive Continental travel\", and went on to serve as architect in charge of the Cathedral for six years. He was also in partnership for a time prior to 20 August 1862 with John Wilson Walton (c. 1822–1910). His first church, St. Cuthbert's, Durham (1863), was inspired in part by the plain 13th century church at Formigny, Normandy. For some time he served as architect and surveyor to the city of Liverpool, which served to give him sufficient experience when he was the surprising choice as chief architect for the newly-erected School Board of London, in 1871. He became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Under the terms of the reforming Elementary Education Act 1870, a great number of new state-funded schools had to be built as quickly as possible, especially in the East End. Robson's experience, for which he travelled in the Continent for the most up-to-date school-planning ideas, was encapsulated in his School Architecture (1874). For the workload, he formed a partnership with J. J. Stevenson from 1871 until 1876. The schools themselves were of brick and architectural terracotta in the many-gabled free Anglo-Flemish Renaissance style known at the time as \"Queen Anne style\", which Robson chose as more suitably enlightened and secular than Gothic Revival and in which Stevenson had already shown himself proficient. \\n\\nDuring his years with the School Board, Robson designed several hundred schools in London, and after leaving the Board in 1884 he remained as consulting architect to the Education Department. \\n\\nHis early connections with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood may have made him an obvious choice in 1888 for remodelling some market buildings with great dispatch for the New Gallery, Regent Street, a venue for art of the Brotherhood and other progressive arts.\\n\\nRobson also built the People's Palace, Stepney (1886, now a part of Queen Mary, University of London) as well as working on new school structures, notably Primrose Hill Infants' School and the Cheltenham Ladies' College (1896) and the Jews' Free School in Spitalfields (1904).\\n\\nHe married Marian, daughter of Henry Longden, of Sheffield, and Who's Who notes his recreations as \"golf, bicycling, billiards\". At the time of his death, he was a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Society of Antiquaries of London, and the Chartered Surveyors' Institution.\\n\\nIn his later years he worked with his son, Philip Appleby Robson.

He quickly rose within the ranks, becoming the contact for fan magazine, then trade paper, and finally the New York City press. His employment at Fox was interrupted by a two-year stint with the United States Air Force, during which he was stationed at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. His commanding officer expected him to use his skills as a publicist to get him promoted from colonel to general, a task Feldman completed successfully before he returned to civilian life.\\n\\nIn 1959, Feldman left Fox to promote The World of Suzie Wong and its producer, Ray Stark, for Paramount Pictures. His assignment began with location shooting in Hong Kong and ended with the release of the film. He clashed with Stark throughout the production, which prompted him to resign from Paramount and join Embassy Pictures as the head of advertising and publicity. Two years later, Stark invited him to join him at Seven Arts Productions, where his first project was the controversial screen adaptation of Lolita. Due to Feldman's intervention, the Catholic Legion of Decency agreed not to rate the film \"condemned\" if the studio would enforce a rule banning anyone under the age of eighteen from theaters showing it. Once Seven Arts acquired Warner Bros., Feldman relocated to Hollywood, where he remained with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts for two years, during which time he became active in film production.\\n\\nBecause of his association with Stark, son-in-law of comedienne Fanny Brice, Feldman handled advertising and publicity for the Broadway production of Funny Girl throughout its run.\\n\\nFeldman's first credit as a film producer was the 1971 melodrama What's the Matter with Helen? starring Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters.

The small hall has a capacity of 350 (which is smaller than the old Effenaar) and is used for smaller and/or regional bands.\\n\\nThe old Effenaar has hosted many large (national and international) acts throughout its existence, including The Ramones, U2, The Cure, Joy Division, Sex Pistols, Red Hot Chili Peppers, R.E.M. and Queens of the Stone Age.\\n\\n<br clear=\"all/>\\n\\n200pxThe Effenaar was founded in 1971 under the name Open Jongerencentrum (Open Youth center), by young adults with a critical view of society. The Jongerencentrum was established in the abandoned Van den Briel & Verster linen factory; the building was originally renamed \"Para+\". The name \"Effenaar\" is a reference to the old linen factory, which had a machine to remove creases from fabric; in Dutch this is called effenen and the machine was therefore called the effenaar. The Effenaar hosted evenings where young people could express their discontent with society, politics and their parents. After five years the group decided to allow the Effenaar to grow more in the direction of cultural events, but still with criticism of society as the main focus.\\n\\nWith time, the group abandoned more and more of its societal role and put more time and effort into putting on musical events. The focus shifted more and more to cultural activities. In 1986 the decision was made to widen the target audience and to make the character of the place more open and welcoming.

Although the basketball department was founded in 1956, it took the club exactly fifty years to participate in the A1 division, which is the highest professional basketball league in Greece, in the 2006-07 season. During the 1950s and 1960s, the team remained in the lowest local (third) division, until 1971, when it qualified for the higher league, because of a new categorical system. \\n\\nIn 1973 and 1974, Egaleo BC won two league promotions, and finally took part in the B Ethniki (1974–75, 1975-76 seasons). For the next 12 years, the team participated in the first local league (A E.S.K.A.), except in the 1981-82 season, when it was in the B E.S.K.A., after 1981's relegation. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Egaleo BC participated in the C Ethniki, where it played six seasons in total, but was relegated again to the local league in 1994. \\n\\nIn 1997, Egaleo won the A E.S.K.A.

{"title": "Egyptian numerals", "body": "The system of Ancient Egyptian numerals was used in Ancient Egypt until the early first millennium AD. It was a decimal system, often rounded off to the higher power, written in hieroglyph. The hieratic form of numerals stressed an exact finite series notation, ciphered one to one onto the Egyptian alphabet.The Ancient Egyptian system used bases of ten. They also created the 365 day calendar\\n\\nthe following hieroglyphics were used to denote powers of ten:\\n\\nMultiples of these values were expressed by repeating the symbol as many times as needed. For instance, a stone carving from Karnak shows the number 4622 as\\n\\nEgyptian hieroglyphs could be written in both directions (and even vertically). This example is written left-to-right and top-down; on the original stone carving, it is right-to-left, and the signs are thus reversed.\\n\\nRational number could also be expressed, but only as sums of unit fraction, i.e., sums of reciprocal of positive integers, except for 2/3 and 3/4. The hieroglyph indicating a fraction looked like a mouth, which meant \"part\":\\n\\nFractions were written with this fractional solidus, i.e., the numerator 1, and the positive denominator below. Thus, 1/3 was written as:\\n\\nThere were special symbols for 1/2 and for two non-unit fractions, 2/3 (used frequently) and 3/4 (used less frequently):\\n\\nIf the denominator became too large, the \"mouth\" was just placed over the beginning of the \"denominator\":\\n\\nFor plus and minus signs, the hieroglyphs\\n\\nwere used: if the feet pointed into the direction of writing, it signified addition, otherwise subtraction.\\n\\nAs with most modern day languages, the ancient Egyptian language could also write out numerals as words phonetically, just like one can write thirty instead of \"30\" in English. Thirty, for instance, was written as\\n\\nwhile the number 30 was\\n\\nThis was, however, uncommon for most numbers other than one and two and the signs were used most of the time.\\n\\nAs administrative and accounting texts were written on papyrus or ostraca, rather than being carved into hard stone (as were hieroglyphic texts), the vast majority of texts employing the Egyptian numeral system utilize the hieratic script. Instances of numerals written in hieratic can be found as far back as the Early Dynastic Period. The Old Kingdom |Abusir Papyri are a particularly important corpus of texts that utilize hieratic numerals.\\n\\nBoyer proved 50 years ago that hieratic script used a different numeral system, using individual signs for the numbers 1 to 9, multiples of 10 from 10 to 90, the hundreds from 100 to 900, and the thousands from 1000 to 9000. A large number like 9999 could thus be written with only four signs—combining the signs for 9000, 900, 90, and 9—as opposed to 36 hieroglyphs. Boyer saw the new hieratic numerals as ciphered, mapping one number onto one Egyptian letter for the first time in human history. Greeks adopted the new system, mapping their counting numbers onto two of their alphabets, the Doric and Ionian.\\n\\nIn the oldest hieratic texts the individual numerals were clearly written in a ciphered relationship to the Egyptian alphabet. But during the Old Kingdom a series of standardized writings had developed for sign-groups containing more than one numeral, repeated as Roman numerals practiced. However, repetition of the same numeral for each place-value was not allowed in the hieratic script. As the hieratic writing system developed over time, these sign-groups were further simplified for quick writing; this process continued into Demotic as well.\\n\\nTwo famous mathematical papyri using hieratic script are the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.\\n\\nThe following table shows the reconstructed Middle Egyptian forms of the numerals (which are indicated by a preceding asterisk), followed by the transliteration of the hieroglyphs used to write them, and finally the Coptic numerals which descended from them and which give Egyptologists clues as to the vocalism of the original Egyptian numbers. The majuscule letter \"A\" in some reconstructed forms means that the quality of that vowel remains uncertain:\\n\\narz:ارقام مصرية\\n\\n"}

Until 1803 the Eichsfeld was for centuries part of the Archbishopric of Mainz, which is the cause of its current position as a Catholic enclave in the predominantly Protestant north of Germany. Following German partition in 1945, the West German portion became Landkreis Duderstadt. A few small transfers of territory between the American and Soviet zones of occupation took place in accordance with the Wanfried Agreement.\\n\\nthumb Today the greatest part of the Obereichsfeld makes up the Landkreis (district) Eichsfeld. Other parts belong to the district Unstrut-Hainich. The Untereichsfeld, later Landkreis Duderstadt, was merged mostly with the Landkreis of Göttingen, while Lindau became part of Katlenburg-Lindau which is know part of the Landkreis of Northeim. \\n\\nCities in the Eichsfeld are Duderstadt, Heiligenstadt, Leinefelde-Worbis and Dingelstädt.\\n\\nthumb The Eichsfeld was first mentioned in 897, and in 1022 the Archbishopric of Mainz listed its possessions in the region, which were increased up until 1573. The ottonian Untereichsfeld became part of Eichsfeld after being part of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Grubenhagen between 1342 and 1434.\\n\\nDuring the German Peasants' War within the Reichsstadt of Mühlhausen most of the monasteries, churches and castles were plundered and most of the Eichsfeld became Protestant. \\n\\nIn 1575 the Society of Jesus successfully established the Counter-Reformation in Eichsfeld. The Thirty Years' War reached Eichsfeld in 1622 and during the years following several armies (Swedish, Danish, Thuringian) plundered the region. According to the Peace of Westphalia the Archbishopric of Mainz reestablished Catholicism in the area which was two thirds devastated and had lost 75% of its population. \\n\\nDuring the Napoleonic time Eichsfeld was part of the Kingdom of Westphalia, which was dissolved after the victory over Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig.\\n\\nFrom 1949 to 1990 the Obereichsfeld belonged to the GDR. In this atheistic state the people preserved their Catholic roots, and church life stayed relatively intact.\\n\\nIn consequence of the traditionalism in Eichsfeld, the percentage of voters for the CDU is significantly higher than in the surrounding area.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eider Barrage", "body": "thumbthumbthumbthumbThe Eider Barrage () is located at the mouth of the river Eider near Tönning on Germany’s North Sea coast. Its main purpose is protection from storm surge by the North Seas. It is Germany’s largest coastal protection structure. It was also intended to contribute to economic recovery in the districts of Norderdithmarschen (today part of Dithmarschen) and Eiderstedt (today part of Nordfriesland).\\n\\nCelebrated as a structure of the century, it was opened on 20 March 1973. Following the North Sea flood of 1962 which swept through Tönning, consideration was given to raising the dykes along the banks of the Eider or building a storm surge barrier at its mouth. The latter was chosen and construction work began in 1967. The current conditions in the estuary caused great difficulties and the cost of construction was correspondingly high (ca. 170 million DM = ca. 87 million euros). The line of dykes in the Eider region was shortened from 60 km to 4.8 km. The new current conditions however dug a new hole about 30 metres deep directly in front of the dyke and lock which had to be filled in during the 1980s with 20,000 sandbags. \\n\\nThe barrage comprises two separate rows each of five gates. The site was laid out in such a way as to guarantee the level of protection of a double dyke. Between the gates a road runs through, protected by a 236 metre long tunnel. Above the tunnel is a footpath, which offers a good view of the west coast and the river Eider. Also equipped with double gates is a lock incorporated into the barrage for shipping. Including the newly-built dyke, the barrage is 4.9 kilometres long, lies 8.5 metres above sea level and 7 metres above the average high tide. Five gates, each 40 metres long, allow the water of the Eider to flow into the North Sea when the tide ebbs, and North Sea water into the Eider when it flows. Nearby is a 75 metre long and 14 metre wide lift lock (Kammerschleuse), through which ships pass into the North Sea from the adjacent harbour. \\n\\nToday the barrage is also a tourist attraction as they travel through Eiderstedt with its seaside resorts of Sankt Peter-Ording and Vollerwiek or the resort of Garding. The construction of the barrage resulted in the old Eider estuary becoming the Katinger Watt nature reserve; on the opposite side of the river in 1989 the Dithmarscher Eiderwatt was established in order to at least partially compensate for the losses of salt meadows and mudflats caused by the building of the barrage. Many fishing smacks were moved from Tönning to the fishing port by the barrage which was closer to the fishing grounds. At the barrage itself there is a large breeding colony of Arctic tern with 143 breeding pairs in 2006.\\n\\nThe barrage is also the closing scene of the 1977 Wim Wenders film The American Friend. \\n\\n"}

Despite her popularity, Fulton's run has not been without controversy. During the late 1960s, after her onscreen son was SORAS from age 12 to 19, Fulton was noted for insisting it be written into her contract that her character could not become a grandmother. That insistence was because she feared that the perception of her as a grandmother instead of a glamorous and vital woman, would cause the writers to kill off her character, which they had done when Barbara Berjer, who was playing one of Lisa's Rivals, Claire Shea, became a grandmother. Fans, believing that the \"granny clause\" as it became known, was still in effect (which it wasn't), sent Fulton so much threatening \"hate mail\" when Lisa's onscreen daughter-in-law, Margo, had a miscarriage in 1986, that she had to hire a bodyguard. Now in her seventies, Fulton's character has two sons—a third son died a number of years ago—and four grandchildren.\\n\\nShe left the show three times - first for several months in 1963, when she was replaced in the role of Lisa by actress Pamela King; in 1965 to bring her Lisa character to her own prime time soap spin-off, Our Private World(CBS's attempt to mimic the success of ABC's Peyton Place). Our Private World lasted less than a season, and Fulton took several months off before returning to [As the World Turns in early 1966. She left again in 1983 after a contract dispute with executive producer Mary-Ellis Bunim, returning the next year. During Fulton's 1983-1984 absence, the role of Lisa was played by Betsy von Furstenberg. The following actresses played the part during Fulton's temporary leaves: Lynn Rogers (1977–1978), Jane Powell (1991, 1993, and 1994), Maeve McGuire (1992) and Carmen Duncan (2004).\\n\\nAlthough the character of Lisa appeared on the show through its 2010 cancellation, Fulton was vocal in later years about her displeasure at not being more prominently featured. Fulton was prominently featured in April 2006 during the show's 50th anniversary episode, and from January 2008 to August 2008, was roughly seen in at least two episodes per week. Her appearances dropped off after that time, though she was again featured in a two-part tribute episode in May 2010, and remained on the show through its cancellation, appearing in the final episode in September 2010.\\n\\nFulton has written two memoirs, How My World Turns and As My World Still Turns. She also wrote a mystery novel, called Soap Opera, loosely based on her experiences on As the World Turns as well as a series of murder mystery novels Take One for Murder about a soap opera star \"Nina\" and her detective boyfriend \"Dino.\" Fulton is also a singer, and has performed a number of cabaret and nightclub acts, in addition to her acting.\\n\\nFulton is a 1955 graduate of Greensboro College and was granted an honorary doctorate in 2005, on the 50th anniversary of her college graduation.

{"title": "Eilzugwagen", "body": "The Eilzugwagen was a type of railway passenger coach (US: passenger car) specially developed for German semi-fast (or fast stopping) trains, known as Eilzüge. These coaches were first built in the 1930s and continued to be produced until the 1950s. Today all coaches of this type have been retired. A number still run on museum railways.\\n\\nEilzüge first ran in Germany in 1907. These were express train (Schnellzüge), that did not switch to hauling the new through coach, but stayed with the conventional, eight-wheeled compartment coach common at that time. Not until the end of the 1920s did the Deutsche Reichsbahn consider developing special wagons as eight-wheeled open coach for the semi-fast train class. \\n\\nFollowing the construction of trials coaches in 1928 and 1929, the full production of 150 Eilzugwagen began in 1930; 2nd and 2nd/3rd class variants being turned out. The full designation of these coaches was B4i-30 (later Ayse 604) and BC4i-30 (later Abyse 617). Other, 3rd class only, coaches entered service as C4i-30 (later Bye 655). They were classified as Type (Verwendungsgruppe) E 30.\\n\\nThese coaches were of rivetted construction in accordance with the standards of the time. They had an open 3rd class section with a centre aisle and 2+3 seating arrangement, and four 2nd class compartments each with six seats. As on express coaches, the entrances were inset, but the roof was of basket arch design at the coach ends, as on the Class 28 Rheingold Express coaches. The entrances at the ends of each coach had double doors for 3rd class and a single swing door for 2nd class. By each of the entrance ways was a toilet with a wash basin. The windows were 800 mm wide in 3rd class and one metre wide in 2nd class.\\n\\nThe coaches had Görlitz Type II (light) bogies. The gangways were open and only secured with folding lattice gates (Scherengitter), so there was no protection from the elements.\\n\\nIn 1935 development started on a successor to the E 30. The main difference was the welded coach body. In addition an extra half-compartment was added because the coach, at 20 m long, had more space than its predecessor. To enable a better view the bottom edge of the windows was lowered and the panes enlarged. Other features, like the open gangways and Görlitz bogies, were identical to those of the E 30. Only C4i-36 and BC4i-37 coach variants were placed in service because, unlike its predecessor, the E 30, no more pure 2nd class coaches were ordered. Later these coaches were reclassified as Bye 667 and Abyse 630 by the DB. \\n\\nFrom the Schürzenwagen series of coaches, a semi-fast, Eilzug, variant was developed. In important details it was the same as the previous class, the E 36. However the coach body was now streamlined (by tapering the ends) and had panels or 'skirts' covering the sole bars. These even covered the new Reichsbahn-standard bogies which were very similar to the Minden-Deutz bogies later used by the DB. For the first time in the Deutsche Reichsbahn, Eilzugwagen were given gangways protected by folding bellows (Faltenbalge). As a result they could be used, if need be, in express trains because from now on passengers could pass from one coach to another. Nevertheless the open layout was retained, as on the E 30 and E 36 coaches - as were the inset double doors at the ends of the coaches of what was now the 2nd class section. The 1st class section just had a simple swing door at the end of the coach. However the half-compartment in the centre of the wagon was omitted.\\n\\nTwo prototypes with 2nd and 3rd class seating were delivered by LHW to the Reichsbahn at Breslau in 1939: the BC4üp-39 (later the AByse 631) built to a very light structural design. This meant that they were particularly suitable for use on hilly routes. The interior of the 3rd class area was—as was de rigueur at that time—fitted with wooden seats; 2nd class sections were given soft, fabric-covered seats. In all, according to plans at that time, 8,550 coaches of this type were to be bought in order to finally get rid of the old, eight-wheeled, compartment coaches. 650 were to be built as ABüp, the rest as C4üp.\\n\\nTo achieve this, head office drew up a four year plan. However, due to the shortage of raw materials during the Second World War, only 125 composite (AB) coaches were ordered, of which by 1944 only 45 could be delivered: the BC4üp-42a (later Abyse 633). 17 units ended up in the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB). Of the 3rd class coaches, the C4üp-42a, 100 units were delivered. The 40 that were left to the DB were later classed as Bye 669. Another 250 Eilzügwagen of type C4üp-43a were delivered, but they were used as ambulance coaches until the end of the war. These were later classified as Bye 670 where they ended up in the DB fleet.\\n\\nBefore their interior could be fitted out, several of these coaches were used as so-called Stehwagen (static coaches) until the founding of the Bundesbahn.\\n\\nWhen the passenger classes were restructured in 1956, BC coaches became ABs and C coaches became Bs. In 2nd class the same soft seats were fitted as in the E-30 and E-36 types. Coaches left behind in Austria after the war were, like all pre-war Reichsbahn coaches, upgraded and modernised during the 1960s with UIC sliding windows and new cushioned seats. \\n\\nFrom 1955 to 1960 all pre-war Eilzugwagen in the DB were refurbished and modernised. Instead of wooden seats, they were fitted with cushioned seats with imitation leather covers and the seats were arranged in a 2+2 configuration. The light bulbs were largely replaced by fluorescent strip lights. The coaches so converted were eventually classed as Ayse, AByse and Bye with code numbers in the 600 series. \\n\\nAlmost all these semi-fast coaches were used until the 1970s in their designated role; only then did many end up on local passenger services. Whilst the DB coaches remained in service until 1984, those left in the DR were rebuilt in the 1960s, like the other DR Schürzenwagen, into the so-called 'modernised coaches' (Modernisierungswagen). \\n\\nFrom 1951 the DB acquired new coaches for semi-fast services called Städtewagen or city coaches. These were the first coaches in the DB to be built to the new UIC template for X class coaches and had a standard length of 26.4 m. These coaches had, in addition to the end doors, a double door in the middle. The doors were of the swing door type. Like the UIC express coaches they were of welded, all-steel construction and were equipped with the rubber corridor connectors commonly used today. \\n\\nMinden-Deutz bogies were fitted. On these coaches the 2nd class (1st class after the 1956 reform) areas were open plan. By the entrance ways at each end of the coach was a toilet. The coaches were fitted for both steam and electric heating and were rated at up to 120 km/h.\\n\\nThe following variants were procured: C4ymg-51 (later Bylb 421), BC4yg (later ABylb 411), CPwymg-51, a large number of which were fitted with driver's cabs for push-pull operations and designated as CPwygmf (later BDylbf 456). The driver's cab end of the coach had an inset entrance located one compartment-length from the end to make room for the cab.\\n\\nThese coaches were joined by four luggage/buffet cars of class CRrymg-54 (later BRyl 446) and prototypes of 1st class open coaches, the Aymg-52, later reclassified as Ayl 401. The code letter b was only given to coaches with control wiring, their classification until 1975 being …ym(b).\\n\\nFollowing their delivery the new coaches were initially used in light express trains. Only after the 1956 class reform, when 3rd class was upgraded to 2nd class and 2nd to 1st were the Städtewagen placed in their intended role. In their early years, the driving cars had been used with six-wheeled Umbauwagen (rebuild coaches) on suburban services in conurbations like Hamburg. Later on, with the delivery of new Silberling local train coaches from 1959, the driving car was used with those as well. In the 1980s the control equipment on all these coaches was removed. \\n\\nIn the 1970s and 80s the Städtewagen were also used in conventional local passenger trains, especially from 1892 on the conversion of many district Eilzüge to supplement-free express trains and on the retirement of pre-war coaches.\\n\\nThe last yl coaches were retired from the DB in 1990, because they wanted to avoid having to fit them for central locking which would have been expensive. Several coaches have ended up, however, via a third party in the DR and were employed in Berlin suburban services including Berlin-Lichtenberg to Nauen and Falkensee.\\n\\nAfter their retirement, several yl coaches were used as centre cars in testing the new InterCityExpress driving cars. \\n\\nMany pre-war and post-war semi-fast coaches have been preserved. For example, the Ulm Railway Society at Ettlingen runs several pre-war Eilzugwagen. Others belong to the Traditions-Eilzug Zwickau.\\n\\nSeveral post-war Eilzug coaches, including a driving car, also still exist. The BSW Lübeck looks after two coaches belonging to the Nuremberg Transport Museum. Several yl coaches are also operational with the Bavarian Railway Museum at Nördlingen.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "EinStein würfelt nicht!", "body": "EinStein würfelt nicht! (... does not play dice) is a board game, designed by Ingo Althöfer, a professor of applied mathematics in Jena, Germany. It is the official game of an exhibition about Einstein in Germany during the Einstein Year (2005). \\n\\nThe name of the game in German has a double meaning:\\n\\nrightThe game is played on a square board with a 5×5 grid. Each player has six cubes, numbered one to six, which are placed as illustrated in the image. During setup, each player can arrange the cubes as he/she sees fit. \\n\\nThe players take turns rolling a six-sided die and then moving the matching cube. If the matching cube is no longer on the board, the player moves a remaining cube whose number is next-highest or next-lowest to the rolled number. The player starting in the top-left may move that cube one square to the right, down, or on the diagonal down and to the right; the player starting in the bottom-right may move that cube one square to the top, left, or on the diagonal up and to the left. Any cube which already lies in the target square is removed from the board. \\n\\nThe object of the game is to either get one of your cubes to the far corner square in the grid (where your opponent started) or to remove all of your opponent's cubes from the board.\\n\\nThe fewer cubes you have, the \"more mobile\" they are, since more dice rolls can result in moving the same piece. Therefore it can be helpful to aim to remove one's own cubes in order to be able to move them with a higher individual probability than having multiple cubes remaining.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "El Bulli", "body": "El Bulli (as of 2008, the restaurant refers to itself with the orthography elBulli) is a Michelin 3-star restaurant near the town of Roses, Catalonia, Spain, run by chef Ferran Adrià. The small restaurant overlooks Cala Montjoi, a bay on Catalonia's Costa Brava, and has been described as \"the most imaginative generator of haute cuisine on the planet\" and does a great deal of work on molecular gastronomy.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a limited season: the 2010 season, for example, ran from June 15 to December 20. Bookings for the next year are taken on a single day after the closing of the current season. It accommodates only 8,000 diners a season, but gets more than two million requests. The average cost of a meal is €250; the restaurant itself has operated at a loss since 2000, with operating profit coming from El Bulli-related books and lectures by Adrià. As of April 2008 the restaurant employed 42 chefs.\\n\\nRestaurant Magazine judged El Bulli to be Number One on its Top 50 list of the world's best restaurants for a record five times — in 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, and #2 in 2010.\\n\\nThe El Bulli location was selected in 1961 by Dr Hans Schilling, a German, and his Czech wife Marketta, who wanted a restaurant for a piece of land he had purchased. The name \"El Bulli\" came from the French bulldog the Schillings owned. The first restaurant was opened in 1964. The restaurant won its first Michelin star in 1976 while under French chef Jean-Louis Neichel. Ferran Adrià joined the staff in 1984, and was put in sole charge of the kitchen in 1987. In 1990 the restaurant gained its second Michelin star, and in 1997 its third.\\n\\nEl Bulli has published books on its development, menu, and philosophy since 1993, in both large format, some including CD-ROMs, and small format for supermarket sales. Ferran Adrià, Juli Soler, and Albert Adrià published A Day at elBulli in 2008. The book describes 24 hours in the life of elBulli in pictures, commentary and recipes. Among the recipes included in the book are melon with ham, pine nut marshmallows, steamed brioche with rose-scented mozzarella, rock mussels with seaweed and fresh herbs, and passion fruit trees. Anthony Bourdain described Albert Adrià's contributions thus: \"His book is a shockingly beautiful catalog of his latest accomplishments here… Pastry chefs everywhere—when they see this—will gape in fear, and awe, and wonder. I feel for them; like Eric Clapton seeing Jimi Hendrix for the first time, one imagines they will ask themselves 'What do I do now?'.\"\\n\\nrightTexturas is a range of products by Ferran Adrià and his brother Albert Adrià. The products include the Sferificación, Gelificación, Emulsificación, Espesantes and Surprises lines and are the result of a rigorous process of selection and experimentation. Texturas include products such as Xanthan and Algin which are packaged and labeled as Xantana Texturas and Algin Texturas respectively. Xanthan gum allows the user to use a very small amount to thicken soups, sauces and creams without changing the flavour. Algin is a key component of the \"Spherification Kit\" and is essential for every spherical preparation: caviar, raviolis, balloons, gnocchi, pellets, and mini-spheres.\\n\\nFerran Adrià has announced he will be closing El Bulli in 2012, due to the massive monetary loss it was incurring. He was quoted by The New York Times as planning to replace it with a culinary academy. He later denied the announcement, saying that The New York Times had misquoted him, and stated that El Bulli would reopen in 2014 after a two-year hiatus, as \"initially planned,\" and will still serve food. Adrià later confirmed, in an October 2010 Vanity Fair article, that the restaurant will be closing permanently after July 2011.\\n\\n"}

It was a limited-run series that debuted in the US on June 30, 2008. It was based on Caridad Bravo Adams's story La Mentira (The Lie), previously adapted for television in 1965 and 1998. The show starred Natalia Streignard, Osvaldo Ríos and Dominika Paleta, and is also known as Secret Lies.\\n\\nBTV started to air this telenovela on November 13, 2008 in Bulgaria. Fox Televizija started to air this telenovela on January 5, 2009 in Serbia.This telenovela was sold to 15 countries around the world.\\n\\nEl Juramento tells the story of Santiago, a dashing hero who sets out to avenge the death of his brother, Diego. He discovers that Diego killed himself after the beautiful Alma, a depraved gold-digger, aborted a child that she falsely claimed was Diego's and refused his marriage proposal via a \"Dear John\" letter. Thanks to the village inhabitants - who at first are hostile but become friendly - Santiago discovers pieces of the puzzle that led to the tragedy. Yet all he knows of the mysterious woman’s identity is a necklace, a gift from Alma and her cousin Andrea’s late grandfather. The two cousins own identical necklaces each of which has a gold letter \"A.\"\\n\\nSantiago seeks revenge on the faithless lover. The clues bring him to a hacienda in Mexico, where Diego was once a trusted worker. A wealthy man, Teodoro Robles Conde,owns the house and lives with his two nieces—and our hero knows one of them caused Diego's suicide, but which one?\\n\\nSantiago meets the pair of rich, gorgeous cousins, treacherous Alma and virtuous Andrea. The first time he sees Alma, she is wearing Andrea's necklace, because Alma left her own necklace in Diego's possession. At first, Santiago acknowledges that either of the cousins might be the guilty one. Partly as a result of a series of mishaps and false rumors, mostly contrived and spread by Alma, but also because Santiago is attracted to Andrea and assumes his brother would have preferred Andrea, too, Santiago decides that Andrea is the one who betrayed Diego. He decides to make her life miserable as revenge for his brother's death. As a result, Andrea endangers herself for her cousin's wrongdoings.\\n\\nSantiago unleashes his vengeful plan: He flirts with Andrea, seduces her and makes her fall in love to the extreme of making her his bride. After the wedding, he drags her to the small remote village where Diego killed himself. Santiago does not see that both he and Andrea are really victims of Alma, whose angelic face hides a demonic soul. Meanwhile, Santiago finds himself falling in love with Andrea but fights hard to resist his feelings in order to keep his oath to Diego.\\n\\nWhen Santiago finds out the truth, it seems that all is lost. Andrea abandons him because he did not trust her. Alma goes unpunished for her deeds while her Aunt Luisa covers her trail. The journey of deception leads to intrigue, passion, confusion, revelations and betrayal. As with all telenovelas love wins in the end—whose love and at what cost? Is it possible to love that which we most hate?\\n\\nthumbThis was the first show filmed at the new Estudios Mexicanos Telemundo in Mexico City, with location shooting in Hidalgo and Querétaro. Telemundo, which had used The Gaby Espino Project as a working title, planned to air the serial from Monday to Friday for 130 episodes, but the show was shortened because ratings were unimpressive. The final episodes were burned off as half-hour broadcasts on Sundays.\\n\\nEl Juramento was originally scheduled to debut in late February (in time for sweeps) under the title of \"El Engaño\". (The show was also known as La Mentira, or The Lie) It was delayed when the original Santiago, Fernando Carrillo was fired and replaced by Osvaldo Ríos. Co-star Gaby Espino left due to pregnancy and Natalia Streignard took her place. Many scenes featuring Carrillo and Espino were already shot and had to be re-filmed with the new stars and concept. The title was replaced to adapt the show to late developments. The good and bad sisters were originally named Connie for Alma and Camila for Andrea.\\n\\nAs with most of its soap operas, the network broadcast English subtitles as closed captions on CC3 until late October, when the network canceled the translations.\\n\\nქა:ფიცი\\n\\n"}

Artist/educator Rafael Montañez Ortíz was enlisted to create materials for schools in East and Central Harlem that would highlight Puerto Rican art, history and culture. Ortiz reconceived this project as a community museum that would primarily function as a neighborhood institution serving Puerto Ricans in East Harlem. With the increasing size of the Latino population throughout New York City, of which Puerto Ricans are still the majority, the scope of the museum has expanded, breeding conflict with some artists, scholars, and neighborhood activists anxious to preserve its original mission.\\n\\nIn the 2000s the museum has seen a great growth in attendance figures, yet remains confined to one floor of its building, which it shares with several city institutions, including a school, and a few private organizations.\\n\\nIn recent years a plan was floated for the Museum of the City of New York, across the street from El Museo, to relocate to the historic Tweed Courthouse by City Hall in Lower Manhattan.

In the event, Mayor Michael Bloomberg decided to site the new New York City Department of Education in the Tweed Courthouse instead, frustrating the efforts of both museums. \\n\\nAfter the failed relocation, El Museo has opted to pursue a $15 million project to transform its outdoor courtyard into an open glass lobby, café and performance space, and to provide a suitable public \"face\" to the street on the model of the renovated Brooklyn Museum. The project will not, however, increase exhibition space, which remains at a premium.\\n\\n"}

The hotel is a \"U\" shape plan with a fifty by fifty foot courtyard with a large fountain in the center. \\n\\nThe main customers of the El Paisano during the 1930s and 1940s were area cattle ranchers who came to Marfa to buy and sell their herds, and tourists who came to West Texas for the benefits of the dry desert air. \\n\\nIn 1955, George Stevens and a Warner Bros film crew came to Presidio County to film Giant. The El Paisano Hotel served as base of operations for the months during which time the film was being shot in the surrounding countryside. Stevens stayed at the El Paisano Hotel as did the 300 plus members of the cast and crew who included: James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Sal Mineo, Chill Wills, and Jane Withers among others. \\n\\nThe hotel began to go into decline in the 1960s and 1970s. El Paisano Properties Corp. bought the property in the late 1970s and converted the hotel's 65 rooms into 9 timeshare condominium. Although 800 timeshare units were sold, the owners eventually abandoned the business and Presidio County foreclosed on the property for back taxes. Joe and Lanna Duncan purchased the property at auction for $185,000 in March 2001. After three years of renovations, the hotel reopened with 33 rooms and suites available for the public.\\n\\n"}

Team leadership and student involvement interchange on an annual basis with the start of a new academic year. The project is supported by a board of Alumni members.\\n\\nAs a result of the large magnitude earthquakes that killed at least 844 people, students from Imperial College London's Civil Engineering Department volunteered to work on a development project from 2002 onwards, to be concentrated in the country's poorest communities over subsequent academic years. \\n\\nStudents from several universities and disciplines have travelled along to El Salvador and worked with the relevant community for 5 to 7 weeks on various development projects.

Infestation with Elaeophora species is referred to as elaeophorosis. The species of Elaeophora have been found in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Despite the fact that they produce aneurysm in the arteries and heart of their hosts which measure up to 2 cm in diameter, overt clinical symptoms of infestation are seldom reported, with the notable exception of E. schneideri infestation in sheep, elk, and moose.\\n\\nThe type species, Elaeophora poeli (Vryburg 1879) Railliet and Henry 1912, was first described as Filaria poeli in 1879. In 1912, the genus Elaeophora was created to distinguish this species from the other species of the genus Filaria. Elaeophora was made the senior synonym of the genera Alcefilaria and Cordophilus in 1976.\\n\\nDetailed life cycle studies have been reported for only one species of Elaeophora so far - E. schneideri. Microfilariae (not eggs) are shed by the adult female from her attachment site inside the lumen of the carotid artery of the definitive host. The microfilariae are carried through the blood stream and become lodged in the small capillaries of the skin in the head and facial areas. Blood-feeding horse flies ingest the microfilariae, which develop into infective larvae in the fly. The infective larvae enter a new definitive (mammal) host through the bite wound when the fly feeds again. The infective larvae migrate to secondary arterial sites, where they mature before migrating to the carotid artery. In the carotid artery, they mature into adults and reproduce sexually to produce microfilariae. It is assumed that the life cycles of other species of Elaeophora follow this general pattern.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elapidae", "body": "Elapidae (Greek éllops = sea-fish)  is a family of venomous snake found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, terrestrially in Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America and aquatically in the Pacific and Indian Ocean. Elapid snakes exist in a wide range of sizes, from 18 cm species of Drysdalia to the 5.6 m king cobra, and are characterized by hollow, fixed fangs through which they inject venom. Currently, 61 genera that include 325 species are recognized. Snakes of this family are known as elapine.\\n\\nAll elapids have a pair of proteroglyphous fangs that are used to inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws. In outward appearance terrestrial elapids look similar to the Colubridae: almost all have long and slender bodies with smooth scales, a head that is covered with large shields and not always distinct from the neck, and eyes with round pupils. In addition, their behavior is usually quite active and most are oviparous. There are exceptions to all these generalizations: e.g. the death adders (Acanthophis) include short and fat, rough-scaled, very broad-headed, cat-eyed, live-bearing, sluggish ambush predators with partly fragmented head shields.\\n\\nSome elapids are strongly arboreal (African Pseudohaje and Dendroaspis, Australian Hoplocephalus), while many others are more or less specialised burrowers (e.g. Ogmodon, Parapistocalamus, Simoselaps, Toxicocalamus, Vermicella) in either humid or arid environments. Some species have very generalised diets, but many taxa have narrow prey preferences (stenophagy) and correlated morphological specialisations, e.g. for feeding on other snakes, elongate burrowing lizards, squamate eggs, mammals, birds, frogs, fish, etc. \\n\\nSea snake, which are also elapids, have adapted to a marine way of life in different ways and to various degrees. All have evolved paddle-like tails for swimming and the ability to excrete salt. Most also have laterally compressed bodies, ventral scales are much reduced in size, their nostrils are located dorsally (no internasal scales) and give birth to live young (ovoviviparous). In general, they have the ability to respire through their skin; experiments with the yellow-bellied sea snake, Pelamis platurus, have shown that this species can satisfy about 20% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, allowing for prolonged dives. The sea kraits (Laticauda spp.), are the least well-adapted to an aquatic life. They spend much of their time on land, where they lay their eggs. They have wide ventral scales, the tail is not as well-developed for swimming, and their nostrils are separated by internasal scales.\\n\\nThe fangs are the first two teeth on each maxillary bone, which are enlarged and hollow, and usually only one is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in length and mobility between typical colubrids (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor; in the longest-fanged elapids (e.g. Acanthophis, Oxyuranus) it is common for the fangs to pierce right through the intermandibular skin, which does not seem to endanger the snake. The fangs are usually below the front edge of the eye and are angled backwards; due to this construction, most elapids must actually bite to envenomate. This action is therefore not as quick as with the viperids, that can envenomate with only a quick, stabbing motion. Some elapids (Acanthophis, Oxyuranus, Dendroaspis, Ophiophagus) have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can make first strike.\\n\\nA few species are capable of spraying their venom from forward-facing holes at the tips of their fangs as a means of defense.\\n\\nOn land, these snakes are found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, except in Europe. Sea snakes occur mainly in the Indian Ocean and the southwest Pacific. However, the range of one species, Pelamis platura, extends across the Pacific to the coasts of Central and South America.\\n\\nAll elapids are venomous and many are potentially deadly. The venoms are mostly neurotoxic which are considered more dangerous than the mainly proteolytic venoms of vipers.Many elapids are also large in size and can deliver a large quantity of highly potent venom; some examples are the Asiatic king cobra, the African black mamba, and the Australian Coastal taipan. Elapids use their venom both to immobilize their prey and in self defense.\\n\\n* Not including the nominate subspecies.\\n\\nThe table above lists all of the elapid genera and no subfamilies. In the past, many subfamilies were recognized, or have been suggested for the Elapidae, including the Elapinae, Hydrophiinae (sea snake), Micrurinae (coral snakes), Acanthophiinae (Australian elapids) and the Laticaudinae (sea kraits). Currently, none are universally recognized. There is now good molecular evidence via karyotyping and protein electrophoretic analysis, immunological distance, DNA sequence analysis etc for reciprocal monophyly of two groups: the African, Asian and New World Elapinae, and Australasian and marine Hydrophiinae. Thus, the Australian terrestrial elapids are 'hydrophiines', though not sea snakes, while it is believed that Laticauda and the 'true sea snakes' evolved separately from among the Australasian land-snakes. Asian cobras, coral snakes, and American coral snakes also appear to be monophyletic, while African cobras do not.\\n\\nThe type genus for the Elapidae was originally Elaps, but that group was moved to another family. In contrast to what usually happens in botany, the Elapidae family was not renamed. In the meantime, Elaps was renamed Homoroselaps and moved back to the Elapidae. However, Nagy et al. 2005 regard it as a sister taxon to Atractaspis which should therefore have been assigned to the Atractaspididae.\\n\\npnb:افعی سپ\\n\\n"}

It is also colloquially referred to as the Nasses Dreieck or \"Wet Triangle\". The Elbe-Weser Triangle is a geographical region and, historically and politically, corresponds roughly to the former territory of Bremen-Verden and formed the major part of the former province of Stade. Today the Elbe-Weser Triangle belongs to Lower Saxony outside the borders of the Hanseatic cities. The Stade Regional Association (Landschaftsverband Stade) operates within the Elbe-Weser Triangle.\\n\\nThe terrain is largely flat and comprises mudflat, marsh, bog and geest. Other areas are characterised by partially dried out bog, such as the Teufelsmoor or the Altes Land and high-moor bogs, like Ahlenmoor, Langes Moor, Hymenmoor and Königsmoor, with peat layers of two to six metres. Typical of the scenery are broad ridges of geest, often covered with pine or mixed woods, heathland and natural rivers such as the Oste, Geeste, Lune, Hamme or the Wümme. In the northern part of the area the only ridge is the Wingst, up to  high. \\n\\nThe basis of the terrain is largely formed from the moraine and meltwater deposits of the Saalian glaciation, the penultimate glaciation period of the pleistocene era. These have created the sand ridges of the geest with their typical glacial erratic boulders of granite and gneiss. The end moraine of the last ice age (Weichselian ice age) did not reach this area. The contours of the land are much softer and flatter than, e.g. in the Holsteinische Schweiz.\\n\\nThe Elbe-Weser Triangle is served by 3 motorways: the A 1 (Bremen–Hamburg), A 26 (Stade–Horneburg) and A 27 (Walsrode−Verden (Aller)–Bremen–Bremerhaven–Cuxhaven). In addition there is a dense network of federal roads, the Bundesstraßen.\\n\\nThere are various railway links such as the Rollbahn main line from Bremen via Rotenburg (Wümme) to Hamburg, the Weser-Aller Line from Rotenburg via Verden to Minden, the Lower Elbe Railway from Hamburg to Cuxhaven and the Bremerhaven–Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven–Buxtehude (–Hamburg), Bremerhaven–Bremen and Bremen–Verden–Hanover railways.\\n\\nThere are sea ports in Bremerhaven, Bremen, Cuxhaven and Bützfleth.

{"title": "Elbow engine", "body": "An elbow engine is a piston-based engine typically fed by steam or compressed air to drive a flywheel and/or mechanical load. Although not commonly used today for practical purposes, it is still built by hobbyists for its uniqueness.\\n\\nA typical elbow engine consists of two solid metal cylinders placed at 90 degrees to each other, each with a ring of holes drilled through them. One metal cylinder would typically be parallel with the ground with the other just above and to the side. Both cylinders rotate on their axes, joined by the pistons seated within their holes and turning 90 degrees to slot through the holes in the other cylinder. This causes both the upper and lower cylinders behave as a crankshaft and as a drive cylinder. Pressure is supplied to the holes on one half each cylinder at the point where the pistons are at a stage of upward travel, and an opening to exhaust is provided to the second half where the pistons are at their descent. The rotation of the cylinders provides the valving effect necessary for operation; the pressure feeds and exhaust remain stationary. This compounded with the fact that each shaft features two pistons results in a low number of moving parts.\\n\\nDespite their apparent simplicity, elbow engines can be difficult to troubleshoot. They are also known to splatter oil when operating.\\n\\n"}

The first Elderhostel programs took place that summer, utilizing the dormitories and classrooms of five colleges in New Hampshire. The organization expanded to campuses across New England, then all fifty states and Canada.\\n\\nElderhostel has evolved over the years. Many early participants had foregone college because of World War II, and Elderhostel provided college campus learning experiences that they had missed out on. They slept in dorms and ate in cafeterias. Over time, the dormitory lodging gave way to comfortable hotels, inns and other more luxurious accommodations.\\n\\nIn 1980, the first Elderhostel program was offered in Canada at the University of New Brunswick.

Some of these programs are designed to accommodate three generations.\\n\\nThe organization offers scholarships to those learners who would otherwise be unable to attend a program. It awards approximately $300,000 in scholarships towards programs in North America each year.\\n\\nElderhostel began as an organization for people age 60 and older, then in the 1990s reduced its minimum age to 55. In 2004, it launched Road Scholar programs, which were geared to Baby Boomers but had no age requirement. In 2009, the organization decided to eliminate any reference to age beyond stating clearly that the programs are intended for adults.\\n\\nAs Elderhostel has grown, accommodations have changed. The early programs took place on college campuses and used the dormitories for lodging. Most multi-day Road Scholar programs now include lodging in hotels, inns or conference centers.

David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said the song has \"an unexpected melodic delicacy.\" The acoustic guitar-driven \"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town\" is still played on popular rock radio.\\n\\nThe lyric page for the song in the album's liner notes featured a picture of an \"elderly woman,\" but at some point after the first pressings another picture was used in place of the original. Allegedly, the original woman never gave permission for her picture to be used, so Pearl Jam changed the picture to another woman. The difference is easy to spot, as \"the new and improved woman behind the counter\" is printed below the picture.\\n\\n\"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town\" was first performed live at the band's June 16, 1993 concert in Missoula, Montana at the University of Montana-Missoula's University Theatre. Live performances of \"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town\" can be found on the \"Dissident\"/Live in Atlanta box set, the live album Live on Two Legs, various official bootlegs, the Live at the Gorge 05/06 box set, and the live album Live at Lollapalooza 2007. A performance of the song is also included on the DVD Live at the Showbox. The live version of \"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town\" from Live on Two Legs managed to reach number 21 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 26 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1998. In Canada, this version reached the top 30 on the Canadian Singles Chart. The song is usually preceded by Vedder saying \"One, two, three, four, two, three.\"\\n\\nA version of \"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town\" by Charlotte Martin can be found on the 2007 album, Reproductions.\\n\\n"}

The Philippines is still grappling with Muslim separatists, predominantly those of the island of Mindanao. In addition, the current president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, won a contentious election in 2004 and is now facing an electoral scandal, after a phone call between her and an election official, taped before the election had concluded, turned up. President Arroyo has denied she made any attempt to influence the vote.\\n\\nIFES (International Foundation for Electoral Systems) currently assists the efforts of both electoral officials and civil society stakeholders to advance comprehensive electoral reform programs for greater legitimacy to the electoral process. Specifically, IFES focuses on building the capacity of the COMELEC to modernize, conduct credible elections, and promote mechanisms that build internal capacities and support transparent administrative practices. Additionally, IFES engages civil society in developing effective advocacy and cooperation to retain gains in reform and equip citizens and COMELEC with skills and knowledge to support implementation of successful elections in the long run.\\n\\nIn most democratic political system, there are a range of different types of election, corresponding to different layers of public governance or geographical jurisdiction. Some common types of election are:\\n\\nA referendum is a democratic tool related to elections in which the electorate votes for or against a specific proposal, law or policy, rather than for a general policy or a particular candidate or party. Referendums may be added to an election ballot or held separately and may be either binding or consultative, usually depending on the constitution. Referendums are usually called by governments via the legislature, however many democracies allow citizens to petition for referendums directly, called initiatives.Referendums are particularly prevalent and important in direct democracies, such as Switzerland. The basic Swiss system, however, still works with representatives. In the most direct form of democracy, anyone can vote about anything. This is closely related to referendums and may take the form of consensus decision-making. Reminiscent of the ancient Greek system, anyone may discuss a particular subject until a consensus is reached. The consensus requirement means that discussions can go on for a very long time. The result will be that only those who are genuinely interested will participate in the discussion and therefore the vote. In this system there need not be an age limit because children will usually become bored. This system is however only feasible when implemented on a very small scale.\\n\\nElectoral systems refer to the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems which convert the vote into a determination of which individuals and political parties are elected to positions of power.The first step is to tally the votes, for which various different vote counting systems and ballot types are used. Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either proportional or majoritarian. Among the former are party-list proportional representation and additional member system. Among the latter are First Past the Post (FPP) (relative majority) and absolute majority. Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as approval voting, single transferable vote, instant runoff voting or a Condorcet method; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.While openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception. The secret ballot is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.\\n\\nWhen elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns. Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize campaign advertising. It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via Political Forecasting methods.\\n\\nIn many countries with weak rule of law, the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being \"free and fair\" is interference from the incumbent government. Dictators may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc.) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favor of removal. Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election.Non-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud which results in improper casting or counting of votes.Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections.Problems which prevent an election from being \"free and fair\" can occur at several different stages:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electric shock", "body": "thumbElectric shock occurs upon contact of a (human) body with any source of electricity that causes a sufficient current through the skin, muscles or hair. Typically, the expression is used to denote an unwanted exposure to electricity, hence the effects are considered undesirable. The minimum current a human can feel is thought to be about 1 milliampere (mA) that's .001A, but this is highly dependent on the frequency of the signal. The current may cause tissue damage or fibrillation if it is sufficiently high. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Generally, currents approaching 100 mA are lethal if they pass through sensitive portions of the body.\\n\\nIf the voltage is less than 200 V, then the human skin, more precisely the stratum corneum, is the main contributor to the impedance of the body in the case of a macroshock the passing of current between two contact points on the skin. The characteristics of the skin are non-linear however. If the voltage is above 450–600 V, then dielectric breakdown of the skin occurs. \\n\\nIf an electrical circuit is established by electrodes introduced in the body, bypassing the skin, then the potential for lethality is much higher if a circuit though the heart is established. This is known as a microshock. Currents of only 10 µ can be sufficient to cause fibrillation in this case. This is a concern in modern hospital settings when the patient is connected to multiple devices.\\n\\nHeating due to resistance can cause extensive and deep burn. Voltage levels of 500 to 1000 volts tend to cause internal burns due to the large energy (which is proportional to the duration multiplied by the square of the voltage divided by resistance) available from the source. Damage due to current is through tissue heating. It is a relatively unknown fact that more electrical workers die from burns than from an electric shock, in fact only around 20% die from the effects of shock.\\n\\nA domestic power supply voltage (110 or 230 V), 50 or 60 Hz AC current through the chest for a fraction of a second may induce ventricular fibrillation at currents as low as 60 mA. With DC, 300 to 500 mA is required. If the current has a direct pathway to the heart (e.g., via a cardiac catheter or other kind of electrode), a much lower current of less than 1 mA (AC or DC) can cause fibrillation. If not immediately treated by defibrillation, fibrillations are usually lethal because all the heart muscle cells move independently instead of in the coordinated pulses needed to pump blood to maintain circulation. Above 200 mA, muscle contractions are so strong that the heart muscles cannot move at all.\\n\\nCurrent can cause interference with nervous control, especially over the heart and lungs. Repeated or severe electric shock which does not lead to death has been shown to cause neuropathy. Recent research has found that functional differences in neural activation during spatial working memory and implicit learning oculomotor tasks have been identified in electrical shock victims.\\n\\nWhen the current path is through the head, it appears that, with sufficient current, loss of consciousness almost always occurs swiftly. (This is borne out by some limited self-experimentation by early designers of the electric chair and by research from the field of animal husbandry, where electric stunning has been extensively studied.)\\n\\nOne major corporation found that up to 80 percent of its electrical injuries involve thermal burns due to arcing faults. The arc flash in an electrical fault produces the same type of light radiation from which electric welders protect themselves using face shields with dark glass, heavy leather gloves, and full-coverage clothing. The heat produced may cause severe burns, especially on unprotected flesh. The blast produced by vaporizing metallic components can break bones and irreparably damage internal organs. The degree of hazard present at a particular location can be determined by a detailed analysis of the electrical system, and appropriate protection worn if the electrical work must be performed with the electricity on.\\n\\nThe voltage necessary for electrocution depends on the current through the body and the duration of the current. Ohm's law states that the current drawn depends on the resistance of the body. The resistance of human skin varies from person to person and fluctuates between different times of day. The NIOSH states \"Under dry conditions, the resistance offered by the human body may be as high as 100,000 Ohms. Wet or broken skin may drop the body's resistance to 1,000 Ohms,\" adding that \"high-voltage electrical energy quickly breaks down human skin, reducing the human body's resistance to 500 Ohms.\"\\n\\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission gives the following values for the total body impedance of a hand to hand circuit for dry skin, large contact areas, 50 Hz AC currents (the columns contain the distribution of the impedance in the population percentile; for example at 100 V 50% of the population had an impedance of 1875Ω or less):\\n\\nThe lethality of an electric shock is dependent on several variables:\\n\\n1) Current (the higher the current, the more likely it is lethal - current NOT voltage kills)2) Duration (the longer the duration, the more likely it is lethal - safety switches limit time of current flow)3) Pathway (if current flows through the heart muscle, it is more likely to be lethal)4) Frequency (maximum lethality unfortunately occurs at 50 to 60 Hz, both DC and higher frequencies are safer than the mains)\\n\\nOther issues affecting lethality are frequency, which is an issue in causing cardiac arrest or muscular spasms, and pathway—if the current passes through the chest or head there is an increased chance of death. From a main circuit or power distribution panel the damage is more likely to be internal, leading to cardiac arrest.. \\n\\nThe comparison between the dangers of alternating current and direct current has been a subject of debate ever since the War of Currents in the 1880s. DC tends to cause continuous muscular contractions that make the victim hold on to a live conductor, thereby increasing the risk of deep tissue burns. On the other hand, mains-magnitude AC tends to interfere more with the heart's electrical pacemaker, leading to an increased risk of fibrillation. AC at higher frequencies holds a different mixture of hazards, such as RF burn and the possibility of tissue damage with no immediate sensation of pain.A common misconception is that higher frequency AC current tends to run along the skin rather than penetrating and touching vital organs such as the heart due to the skin effect. This is false, as the human body has far too high a resistance for this effect to occur. While there will be severe burn damage at higher frequencies, it is normally not fatal.\\n\\nIt is sometimes suggested that human lethality is most common with alternating current at 100–250 volts; however, death has occurred below this range, with supplies as low as 32 volts. Shocks above 2700 volts are often fatal, with those above 11000 volts being usually fatal. Shocks with voltages over 40,000 volts are almost invariably fatal. However, Harry F. Mcgrew came into direct contact with a 340,000 volt transmission line in Huntington Canyon, Utah, and survived. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, this is the largest known electric shock that was survived. Brian Latasa also survived a 230,000 volt shock in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, according to Guinness.\\n\\nThere were 550 electrocutions in the US in 1993, which translates to 2.1 deaths per million inhabitants. At that time, the incidence of electrocutions was decreasing. Electrocutions in the workplace make up the majority of these fatalities. From 1980–1992, an average of 411 workers were killed each year by electrocution.\\n\\nElectric shock is also used as a medical therapy, under carefully controlled conditions:\\n\\nElectroshock weapon are incapacitant weapon used for subduing a person by administering electric shock to disrupt superficial muscle functions. One type is a conductive energy device (CED), an electroshock gun popularly known by the brand name \"Taser\", which fires projectiles that administer the shock through a thin, flexible wire. Although they are illegal for personal use in many jurisdictions, Tasers have been marketed to the general public. Other electroshock weapons such as stun guns, stun batons (\"cattle prods\"), and electroshock belts administer an electric shock by direct contact.\\n\\nElectric shocks have been used as a method of torture, since the received voltage and current can be controlled with precision and used to cause pain while avoiding obvious evidence on the victim's body. Such torture usually uses electrodes attached to parts of the victim's body: most typically, while wires are wound around the fingers, toes, and/or tongue to provide a return circuit, the voltage source (typically a cattle prod) of precisely controllable pressure is applied to the testicles.\\n\\nElectrical torture has been used in war and by repressive regimes since the 1930s: The US Army is known to have used electrical torture during World War II; Amnesty International published an official statement that Russian military forces in Chechnya tortured local women with electric shocks by connecting electric wires to their bra straps; Japanese serial killer Futoshi Matsunaga used electric shocks for controlling his victims.\\n\\nAdvocates for the mentally ill and some psychiatrist such as Thomas Szasz have asserted that electroconvulsive therapy is torture when used without a bona fide medical benefit against recalcitrant or non-responsive patients. See above for ECT as medical therapy. These same arguments and oppositions apply to the use of extremely painful shocks as punishment for behavior modification, a practice that is openly used only at the Judge Rotenberg Institute.\\n\\nElectric shock delivered by an electric chair is sometimes used as an official means of capital punishment in the United States, although its use has become rare in recent times. Although some original proponents of the electric chair considered it to be a more humane execution method than hanging, shooting, poison gassing, etc., it has now generally been replaced by lethal injection in countries that practice capital punishment. Modern reporting has claimed that it sometimes takes several shocks to be lethal, and that the condemned person may actually catch fire before the process is complete. The brain is always severely damaged and inactivated.\\n\\nOther than in parts of the United States, only the Philippines reportedly has used this method, and only for a few years. It is legal in at least 10 states of USA.\\n\\nElectrical injuries\\n\\n"}

The supply is dominated by thermal generation (60%), while hydropower (40%) has a smaller share in its generation mix compared to other South American countries (LAC average hydropower capacity is 51% . The electricity coverage in rural areas is among the lowest in Latin America and improving it represents a major challenge in the future and requires the joint efforts from both the public and private sectors. Like in other countries, Bolivia’s electricity sector consists of National Interconnected System (SIN) and off-grid systems (known as the Aislado).\\n\\nIn Bolivia, the National Interconnected System (SIN) connects major population centers and represents 83% of the installed capacity. The SIN provides electricity to the largest cities and operates in the Departments of Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Oruro, Potosí and Chuquisaca. Its grid extends over 1,200 miles and covers the central and southern parts of the country.  The population in the northern and western parts of the country remains largely unconnected to the national grid, either served by the off-grid system (the Aislado) or having no access to electricity at all. The off-grid system consists of numerous self producers and independent power plants in rural or isolated areas.  \\n\\nTotal installed capacity in 2006 was 1.43 GW, of which 60% was thermal production, which primarily burns natural gas, and 40% hydroelectric. The contribution of other renewables is almost negligible . Total electricity production in the same year amounted to 5.29 TWh. This figure does not include electricity produced in rural areas from biomass facilities, which are unorganized, decentralized, and difficult to quantify . \\n\\nBolivia’s electricity export and import activities are fairly limited. Imports from Brazil amount to less than 0.01 TWh per year  and have so far been devoted to supply the city of Puerto Suarez, in the Department of Santa Cruz .\\n\\nElectric power consumption per capita in 2006 was 588 kWh (a 19% increase since 1996) . By sector, residential consumption represents 40% of the total, followed by industrial consumption with 28%.\\n\\nAccording to the demand projections prepared by the Superintendencia de Electricidad (SE), the generation capacity reserve will be insufficient by 2009 as it will fall below the recommended 10% if no new capacity is developed .\\n\\nIn 2005, total access to electricity in Bolivia was 67%, one of the lowest in Latin America. Urban access was 87%, while rural access remained as low as 30%. \\n\\n(See Recent Developments for more information on electrification plans)\\n\\nService quality as measured by interruptions was much better than the LAC average in 2005. In the period November 2004-October 2005 there were a total of 141 transmission interruptions (up from 86 in the previous period), with a total duration of 4,274 minutes. 57% of the interruptions were due to weather conditions and, while 17% derived from facility operations. In 2005, the average duration of interruptions per subscriber was 5 hours (highest since 1998 although far below the 14 hours average for LAC), while the average number of interruptions per subscriber per year was 7 (highest since 1995 but also the 13 average for LAC) . \\n\\nDuring the 1990s and up to 2005, distribution losses have always been close to 10%, which is below the 13.6% average for the region. \\n\\nThe Viceministry of Electricity and Alternative Energy, within the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, is in charge of establishing policies and designing the regulation for the electricity sector. The Superintendencia de Electricidad  (SE) is responsible for applying the regulation.\\n\\nThe companies that belong to the National Interconnected System (SIN) must be vertically unbundled. However, the companies in the off-grid system (the Aislado) are allowed to perform more than one of the activities defined in the electricity industry (i.e. generation, transmission, distribution). \\n\\nCurrently, there are eight generation companies in the interconnected system, all of them privately owned. The three largest companies alone represent 70% of the total generation . The largest company serving the SIN is the  Compañia Boliviana de Energía Eléctrica (COBEE), which serves the region surrounding La Paz. The other two are Empresa Eléctrica Guarachi (EGSA) and Empresa Eléctrica Corani (CORANI).\\n\\nCurrently, there are two transmission companies in the SIN, Transportadora de Electricidad (TDE), owned by Spain’s Red Electrica de España (REE), and ISA Bolivia, which was created in 2005. ISA Bolivia, which runs 53% of the transmission network in Bolivia, is a subsidiary of Interconexión Eléctrica S.A. (ISA), a corporation controlled by the government of Colombia . The number of companies is limited due to the existence of institutional entry barriers in this sector. \\n\\nIn Bolivia, the six existing distribution companies enjoy a geographic monopoly in their concession areas. . The largest company is Electropaz, majority-owned by Spain’s Iberdrola; followed by Empresa de Luz y Fuerza Eléctrica Cochabamba (ELFEC), which was owned by the American PPL Global until 2007. The third place is occupied by the Rural Electrification Cooperative (CRE), which operates in the Department of Santa Cruz.  \\n\\nIn some cases, especially in the high plateau, cooperatives and community organizations access the distribution companies’ network and sell electricity to small rural communities. Sometimes, those are organized enterprises that provide the service to middle-size towns, but in most cases, they are small organizations that serve family communities. This situation faces a legal vacuum since the consumers benefiting from these scheme, who do not consume the minimum power established legally established, cannot be considered as regulated ones. In addition, these consumers are localized outside the distribution companies’ concession areas, so they cannot receive the companies’ service. In practice, the distribution companies are reselling electricity to the mentioned organizations outside the legal framework. Accurate information on the number of organizations that operate in rural areas does not exist. However, there are approximately three in La Paz, twenty in Oruro and three in Potosi. \\n\\nThe departments of Beni, Pando and Tarija and the eastern region of Santa Cruz are not integrated in the SIN. As a result, there are vertically integrated operators that provide the service. The most important operators are:\\n\\nRenewable energy resources other than hydropower are barely exploited in Bolivia, and their contribution to electricity generation is insignificant. However, the potential of decentralized electricity systems (i.e. solar PV, wind, etc.) for disperse populations was recognized by the government in the Rural Electrification Plan (PLABER). This component established that the service to households, schools and health facilities in areas of low population density would rely on locally available renewable energy sources. \\n\\nThe share of hydropower capacity in Bolivia is 40%, which is below the 51% average for the region . Installed hydroelectric capacity in 2005 was 480 MW, distributed amongst some 21 facilities. The largest plant is the 93 MW Saint Isabel, operated by Corani. \\n\\nThe World Bank is financing a rural infrastructure project in Bolivia which, among others, plans to install 17,000 solar home systems by 2009. Another project funded by the Global Partnership on Out-based Aid which is administered by the World Bank intends to scale up the installations by an additional 7000 in the next three years. (see External Assistance below)\\n\\nThe National Interconnected System (SIN) was created in 1965 and continued its expansion during the ‘70s and ‘80s.  \\n\\nUntil 1994, the vertically integrated public utility, ENDE (Empresa Nacional de Electricidad) dominated the sector . In 1994, Bolivia initiated an infrastructure reform program that included the privatization of the major state owned enterprises. The Electricity Law 1994/1604 mandated the privatization of the electricity system and the unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution activities. The law aimed to increase efficiency in the sector, promote competition and encourage investment. \\n\\nAs a result of privatization, three generation companies were created: Corani, Guaracachi and Valle Hermoso. Each of them received a part of ENDE’s generation activities (the law limited the market share of each to 35%). Initially, these firms were granted exclusive rights, but by 1999 entry was liberalized and some other small companies entered the market. In regards to transmission, network operation was transferred from ENDE to Transportadora de Electricidad, a private company, which acquired exclusive rights. Finally, several distribution firms were created after the reform. All those firms operate under tariff regulation and are subject to tariff controls. CRE (Cooperative for Rural Electrification), a pre-existing distribution cooperative, maintained its position as an independent regional monopoly. CESSA (Compañía Eléctrica de Sucre S.A. ) and SEPSA (Servicios Eléctricos Potosí S.A. ), two pre-existing municipal distribution firms also maintained their monopolies while ELFEC (Empresa Luz y Fuerza Eléctrica Cochabamba), which was a municipal company previously to privatization, started to operate as a private firm. Lastly, the private COBEE (Compañía Boliviana de Energía Eléctrica), which operated both in generation and distribution, gave rise, after its divestiture, to Electropaz (in La Paz) and ELFEO (Empresa Luz y Fuerza Eléctrica Oruro) (in Oruro)..\\n\\nAll these reforms, together with the introduction of a load dispatch coordination office, shaped a wholesale electricity market that seeks to simulate competitive conditions. .\\n\\nIn 2002, the government established Bolivia’s Rural Electrification Plan (PLABER) with the objective of contributing to the socio-economic development of rural areas through access to electricity and its efficient and productive uses. The short-term goal of the program was to make 200,000 new connections within five years (increasing electricity access in rural areas from 23% to 45%).  It had been estimated that, by the end of the program, PLABER would have reached its goals by 70% of the initial objective . However, the model established by this program did not have significative effects in increasing coverage, expanding infrastructure and improving service quality in rural and isolated areas .\\n\\nA new Rural Electrification Decree was approved in 2005 (Supreme Decree No. 28567). This new decree aims at increasing rural access through the extension and densification of electric networks, development of renewable energy and a change in the energy mix (substitution of diesel by natural gas, biomass and other renewable energies) and an increase in distribution capacity. The Rural Electrification Decree and its associated regulatory framework encourages stakeholders in the energy sector to establish partnerships with other government agencies to implement the rural electrification plan. An agreement between the Ministry of Public Works, Services and Housing and the Ministry of Education will allow for the installation of solar PV systems in rural areas in conjunction with the literacy program, “I can” (Yo sí Puedo). Under the pilot phase, 500 solar panels are expected to be installed. \\n\\nIn 2006, under President Evo Morales, a new Law for Universal Access to Electricity (Ley de Acceso Universal) was proposed. Under the framework of this Law, the program called ‘Electricity for a Decent Living” has been designed to improve both rural and urban electrification. The short term goal (2006-2010) of the program is to increase rural electrification to 53% (connection of 210,000 new households) and urban electrification to 97% (connection of 460,000 new households). The medium term goal (2010-2015) is to achieve universal access in urban areas and a 70% access in rural ones. In the final stages, rural access would have increased to 87% by 2020 and universal coverage would be reached by 2025. The Law also mandates de creation of a Common Fund for Universal Access to Public Electricity Service (FOCO) and creates a co-financing mechanism of the National Government with Prefectures, municipalities and the private sector. However, the Law has not been approved yet, although it is expected that the Law and the mechanisms it creates will be approved soon. \\n\\nElectricity tariffs in Bolivia are far lower than average tariffs in Latin America. The average residential tariff in 2006 was US$ 0.0614 per kWh (compared to US$ 0.115 per kWh weighted average LAC), while the average tariff for the industry was US$ 0.044 per kWh (compared to US$ 0.107 per kWh weighted average in LAC).\\n\\nElectricity prices charged by the distribution companies to their regulated clients include energy costs (including generation and transmission costs) and all the distribution costs, including a specific return on investment. However, as it was mentioned before, some distribution companies resell electricity to communal organizations or rural enterprises. The price and conditions of those transactions are not regulated, which causes an important legal void in the sector. \\n\\nIn March 2006, the Bolivian government approved Tarifa Dignidad (“Dignity Tariff”) by Supreme Decree 28653. This tariff grants a 25% discount in their electricity bills to those consumers whose monthly consumption is below 70 kWh in the urban areas and 30 kWh in the rural ones. This subsidy, which will be covered for four years by the electricity companies that operate in Bolivia, will benefit about 480,000 households . \\n\\nIn the years following the privatization of 1994, investment grew considerably due to the obligations imposed on the privatized companies. Public investment remained constant, mainly directed to rural electrification, while private investment was mainly devoted to generation. \\n\\nIn the period 1995-2004, total investment in transmission represented only a modest 2% (US$ 14 million) of the total investment in the electricity sector. Generation and distribution received 58% and 40% of total investment respectively. For the year 2004 in particular, total public investment in the electricity sector was around $US 20million which was matched by another $US20 million from private sources. Those two figures add up to less than 0.5% of Bolivia’s GDP in 2004. .\\n\\nDistribution companies acquire investment commitments for each tariff period. For the period 2003-2005, total investment by the main distribution companies was US$ 39.7 million. This was divided as follows:\\n\\nThe Electricity Law 1994/1604 mandated the privatization of the electricity system and the unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution activities, which had all been in the hands of ENDE (Empresa Nacional de Electricidad) the vertically integrated public utility. Today, 100% of generation, transmission and distribution activities are in private hands. \\n\\nThree of the eight generation companies in the interconnected system represent 70% of total generation, with COBEE (Compañía Boliviana de Energía Eléctrica) being the most important. Transmission in the National Interconnected System is in the hands of just two companies as entry in this sector is institutionally restricted. As for distribution, the six existing companies enjoy a geographic monopoly in their concession areas. The largest company is Electropaz, which is majority-owned by Spain's Iberdrola.\\n\\n(*) 53% of the transmission network is operated by ISA Bolivia, a subsidiary of ISA Colombia, which is controlled by the Colombian government.\\n\\nThe Viceministry of Land Planning and Environment, within the Planning and Development Ministry, holds the environmental responsibilities in Bolivia.\\n\\nOLADE (Organización Latinoamericana de Energía) estimated that CO emissions from electricity production in 2003 were 1.73 million tons of CO, which represents 22 percent of total emissions for the energy sector .\\n\\nCurrently, there are just two CDM-registered projects in Bolivia, one of them in the electricity sector. That is the Rio Taquesi Hydroelectric Power Project, in the province of Sud Yungas, with an effective capacity of 89.5 megawatts and estimated emission reductions of 141,691 metric tonnes COe per annum \\n\\nExternal assistance to the electricity sector in Bolivia is heavily focused on rural electrification with no funding for large-scale generation, which has been fully privatized.\\n\\nCurrently, the World Bank is involved in two projects in the energy sector in Bolivia:\\n\\nThe Inter-American Development Bank provides technical assistance through three projects in the energy sector in Bolivia:\\n\\nIn 2005 and 2007, the Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF) assigned US$32 million  and US$ 15 million  respectively to the increase of electricity services coverage through the construction of two transmission lines. The first one is the 115 kV Caranavi (La Paz)-Trinidad (Beni) line, which has 374 km. The second one is the 230 kV Carrasco and Santibáñez line, with 225 km  .\\n\\nThe German Agency for Technical Cooperation GTZ and the Viceministry of Electricity and Alternative Energy recently signed an agreement to execute a Project for Network Densification in rural areas. Distribution cooperatives will also play an important role in this project, which is part of the program “Electricity to live with dignity”. To facilitate the access to electricity, the Viceministry and GTZ will provide a US$ 20 subsidy per household to enable their connection to the existing network. \\n\\nThe German development bank KfW is also financing a 5 million Euro project to improve rural access to electricity in 2005-8. The project involves the construction of six micro-hydroelectric plants and the completion of studies for another eleven .\\n\\nBolivia\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electricity sector of the United States", "body": "The electricity sector of the United States includes a large array of stakeholders that provide services through electricity generation, transmission, distribution and marketing for industrial, commercial, public and residential customers. It also includes many public institutions that regulate the sector.In 1996, there were 3,195 electric utilities in the United States, of which fewer than a 1,000 were engaged in power generation. This leaves a large number of mostly smaller utilities engaged only in power distribution. There were also 65 power marketers. Of all utilities, 2,020 were publicly owned (including 10 Federal utilities), 932 were rural electric cooperatives, and 243 were investor-owned utilities. The electricity transmission network is not owned by individual utilities, but by Independent System Operator or Regional Transmission Organization, which are not-for-profit organizations that are obliged to provide indiscriminate access to various suppliers in order to promote competition. They are associated in the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and are typically jointly owned by the utilities in their service area.\\n\\nThe four above-mentioned market segments of the U.S. electricity sector are regulated by different public institutions with some functional overlaps: The federal government sets general policies through the Department of Energy, environmental policy through the Environmental Protection Agency and consumer protection policy through the Federal Trade Commission. The safety of nuclear power plants is overseen by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Economic regulation of the distribution segment is a state responsibility, usually carried out through Public Utilities Commission; the inter-state transmission segment is regulated by the federal government through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.thumbOf the electricity generated in the United States in 2006, 70% was produced from fossil fuels (mainly coal and natural gas), almost 20% came from nuclear power, 7% from hydropower and 3% from other forms of renewable energy such as wind and solar energy. The share of renewable energy, in particular wind and solar energy, has increased substantially since 2006 and is expected to increase further.\\n\\nIn 2008 the average electricity tariff in the U.S. was 9.82 Cents/kilowatt-hour (kWh). In 2006-07 electricity tariff in the U.S. were higher than in Australia, Canada, France, Sweden and Finland, but lower than in Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. Residential tariffs vary significantly between states from 6.7 Cents/kWh in West Virginia to 24.1 Cents/kWh in Hawaii. The average residential bill in 2007 was US$ 100/month. Most investments in the U.S. electricity sector are financed by private companies through debt and equity. However, some investments are indirectly financed by taxpayers through various subsidies ranging from tax incentives to subsidies for research and development, feed-in tariff for renewable energy and support to low-income households to pay their electric bills.\\n\\n[[Image:Electricity production in the USA.PNG|thumbnail|400px|]]\\n\\nIn 2007 the total installed electricity generation capacity in the United States was 1,088 Gigawatt. The main energy sources for electricity generation include:\\n\\nActual electricity generation in 2007 was 4,157 Terawatt hours from the following sources:\\n\\nThe share of coal and nuclear in power generation is much higher than their share in installed capacity, because coal and nuclear plants provide base load and thus are running longer hours than natural gas and petroleum plants which typically provide peak load, or than wind turbines or solar plants that cannot produce electricity continuously.\\n\\nFossil fuels - mainly coal and natural gas - remain the backbone of electricity generation in the U.S., accounting for 69% of installed generation capacity in 2006.\\n\\nIn 2007 the Department of Energy estimated the planned additional capacity for 2008-12 at 92 GW, most of which to be fueled by natural gas (48 GW) and coal (19GW).\\n\\nAs of 2007 in the United States, there are 104 commercial nuclear reactors in the US, generating approximately 20% of the nation's total electric energy consumption. For many years, no new nuclear plants have been built in the US. However, since 2005 there has been a renewed interest in nuclear power in the US. This has been facilitated in part by the federal government with the Nuclear Power 2010 Program of 2002. and the Energy Policy Act. As of March 9, 2009, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission had received applications for permission to construct 26 new nuclear power reactors \\n\\nThe development of renewable energy and energy efficiency marks \"a new era of energy exploration\" in the United States, according to President Barack Obama. In a joint address to the Congress on February 24, 2009, President Obama called for doubling renewable energy within the next three years.\\n\\nRenewable energy accounted for more than 10 percent of the domestically-produced energy used in the United States in the first half of 2008, consisting mainly of large hydropower. According to a report by the Interior Department, U.S. wind power - including off-shore turbines - could more than meet U.S. electricity needs. The Department of Energy has said wind power could generate 20% of US electricity by 2030.\\n\\nSeveral solar thermal power stations, including the new 64 MW Nevada Solar One, have also been built. The largest of these solar thermal power stations is the SEGS group of plants in the Mojave Desert with a total generating capacity of 354 MW, making the system the largest solar plant of any kind in the world. The largest solar photovoltaic plant in the U.S. is the 14 MW Nellis Solar Power Plant, located near Las Vegas, Nevada, which is expected to produce more than 30 million kWh/year for Nellis Air Force Base.\\n\\nThe federal government promotes energy efficiency through the Energy Star program. The Alliance to Save Energy, an industry group, also promotes energy efficiency.\\n\\nPolicy. Policy for the electricity sector in the United States is set by the executive and legislative bodies of the federal government and state governments. Within the executive branch of the federal government the Department of Energy plays a key role. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency is in charge of environmental regulation and the Federal Trade Commission is in charge of consumer protection and the prevention of anti-competitive practices.\\n\\nKey federal legislation related to the electricity sector includes:\\n\\nMany state governments have been active in promoting renewable energy. For example, in 2007 25 states and the District of Columbia had established renewable portfolio standard (RPS). There is no federal policy on RPS.\\n\\nRegulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is in charge of regulating interstate electricity sales, wholesale electric rates, and licensing hydropower plants. Rates for electricity distribution are regulated by state-level Public Utilities Commissions or Public Services Commissions.\\n\\nDeregulation of the electricity sector consists in the introduction of competition and the unbundling of vertically integrated utilities in separate entities in charge of electricity generation, electricity transmission, electricity distribution and commercialization. The deregulation of the electricity sector in the U.S. began with the Energy Policy Act of 1992 which removed obstacles for wholesale competition. In practice, however, regulation has been unevenly introduced between states. It began in earnest only from 1996 onwards when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued orders that required utilities to provide transmission services \"on a reasonable and non-discriminatory basis\". In some states, such as in California, private utilities were required to sell some of their power plants to prevent concentration of market power.\\n\\nBy 2008 only about a dozen states had deregulated their electricity markets introducing competition for industrial and commercial customers, as well as for residential customers served by private utilities. The Deregulation of the Texas electricity market in 2002 is one of the best known examples.\\n\\nElectric utilities in the U.S. can be both in charge of electricity generation and electricity distribution. The electricity transmission network is not owned by individual utilities, but by not-for-profit organizations that are obliged to provide indiscriminate access to various suppliers in order to promote competition. In 1996, there were 3,195 electric utilities in the United States and 65 power marketers. Of these, 2,020 were publicly owned (including 10 Federal utilities), 932 were rural electric cooperatives, and 243 were investor-owned utilities. Fewer than 1,000 utilities are engaged in power generation.\\n\\nAbout 80% of the electricity in the U.S. is generated by private (\"investor-owned\") utilities. The remaining electricity is produced by federal agencies such as the Tennessee Valley Authority (producing mainly nuclear and hydropower) and the Power Marketing Administration of the Department of Energy(hydropower), municipal utilities and utility cooperative.\\n\\nThe largest private electric producers in the United States include:\\n\\nThere are two major alternating current (AC) power grid in North America, the Eastern Interconnection and the Western Interconnection. Besides this there are two minor power grids in the U.S., the Alaska Interconnection and the Texas Interconnection. Despite bearing separate designations, the Eastern, Western and Texas Interconnections are tied together at various points creating effectively a single grid for the contiguous U.S., Canada and parts of Mexico. The transmission grids are operated by transmission system operator (TSOs), not-for profit companies that are typically owned by the utilities in their respective service area, where they coordinate, control and monitor the operation of the electrical power system. TSOs are obliged to provide non-discriminatory transmission access to electricity generators and customers. TSOs can by of two types:Independent System Operator (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organization (RTOs). The former operate within a single state and the latter cover wider areas crossing state borders.\\n\\nIn 2009 there were four RTOs in the U.S.:\\n\\nThere are also three ISOs:\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nRTOs are similar, but not identical to the nine Regional Reliability Council associated in the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a non-profit entity that is in charge of improving the reliability and security of the bulk power system in the U.S., Canada and the northern part of Baja California in Mexico. The members of the Regional Reliability Councils include private, public and cooperative utilities, power marketers and final customers. The Regional Reliability Councils are:\\n\\nThe FERC distinguishes between 10 power markets in the U.S., including the seven for which RTOs have been established, well as:\\n\\nISOs and RTOs were established in the 1990s when states and regions established wholesale competition for electricity.\\n\\nAbout 75% of electricity sales to final customers are undertaken by private utilities, with the remainder being sold by municipal utilities and cooperatives.\\n\\nIn 2008 the average electricity tariff in the U.S. was 9.82 Cents/kWh, up from 6.9 Cents/kWh in 1995. Residential tariffs were somewhat higher at 11.36 Cents/kWh, while commercial tariffs stood at 10.28 Cents/kWh and industrial tariffs at 7.01 Cents/kWh. The cost of supplying high-voltage power to high-volume industrial customers is lower than the cost of providing low-voltage (110V) power to residential and commercial customers.\\n\\nIn 2006-07 commercial electricity tariff in the U.S. (9.28 Cents/kWh) were higher than in Australia (7.1 Cents/kWh), Canada (6.18 Cents/kWh) that relies mainly on hydropower or in France (8.54 Cents/kWh) that relies heavily on nuclear power, but lower than in Germany (13.16 Cents/kWh), Italy (15.74 Cents/kWh) or the UK (11.16 Cents/kWh) that all rely to a larger degree on fossil fuels, all compared at purchasing power parity.\\n\\nResidential tariffs vary significantly between states from 6.7 Cents/kWh in West Virginia to 24.1 Cents/kWh in Hawaii. An important factor that influences tariff levels is the mix of energy sources used in power generation. For example, access to cheap federal power from hydropower plants contributes to low electricity tariffs in some states.\\n\\nAverage residential electricity consumption in the U.S. was 936 kWh/month per in 2007, and the average bill was US$ 100/month. Average residential consumption varies considerably between states from 530 kWh/month in Maine to 1344 kWh/month in Tennessee. Factors that influence residential energy consumption are climate, tariffs and efforts to promote energy conservation.\\n\\nTotal revenue from the sale of electricity in 2008 was US$344bn, including US$148bn from residential customers, US$129bn from commercial customers and US$66bn from industrial customers. Many large industries self-generate electricity and their electricity consumption thus is not included in these figures.\\n\\nMost investments in the U.S. electricity sector are financed by private companies through debt and equity. However, some investments are indirectly financed by taxpayers through various subsidies.\\n\\nThere is a large array of subsidies in the U.S. electricity sector ranging from various forms of tax incentives to subsidies for research and development, feed-in tariffs for renewable energy and support to low-income households to pay their electric bills. Some subsidies are available throughout the U.S., while others are only available in some states.\\n\\nTax incentives include federal and state tax deduction and tax break. Tax incentives can be directed at consumers, such as for the purchase of energy-efficient appliances or for solar energy systems, small wind systems, geothermal heat pump, and residential fuel cell and microturbine systems. Tax incentives can also be directed at electricity producers, in particular for renewable energy.\\n\\nThe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) received federal funding of $5.1 billion in Fiscal Year 2009. It is funded mainly by the federal government through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, and is administered by states and territories. While some of its funding is for fuel for heating, some is also used to cover electricity bills for both heating and cooling.\\n\\nIn April, 2009, 11 U.S. state legislatures were considering adopting an feed-in tariff as a complement to their renewable electricity mandates.\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electrolyte", "body": " \\n\\nIn chemistry, an electrolyte is any substance containing free ion that make the substance electrically conductive. The most typical electrolyte is an ionic solution, but molten electrolytes and solid electrolytes are also possible. \\n\\nCommonly, electrolytes are solutions of acids, bases or salts. Furthermore, some gases may act as electrolytes under conditions of high temperature or low pressure. Electrolyte solutions can also result from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., DNA, polypeptides) and synthetic polymers (e.g., polystyrene sulfonate), termed polyelectrolytes, which contain charged functional groups.\\n\\nElectrolyte solutions are normally formed when a salt is placed into a solvent such as water and the individual components dissociate due to the thermodynamic interactions between solvent and solute molecules, in a process called solvation. For example, when table salt, NaCl, is placed in water, the salt (a solid) dissolves into its component ions, according to the dissociation reaction\\n\\nIt is also possible for substances to react with water producing ions, e.g., carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water to produce a solution which contains hydronium, carbonate, and hydrogen carbonate ions.\\n\\nNote that molten salts can be electrolytes as well. For instance, when sodium chloride is molten, the liquid conducts electricity.\\n\\nAn electrolyte in a solution may be described as concentrated if it has a high concentration of ions, or dilute if it has a low concentration. If a high proportion of the solute dissociates to form free ions, the electrolyte is strong; if most of the solute does not dissociate, the electrolyte is weak. The properties of electrolytes may be exploited using electrolysis to extract constituent elements and compounds contained within the solution.\\n\\nIn physiology, the primary ions of electrolytes are sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), chloride (Cl), hydrogen phosphate (HPO), and hydrogen carbonate (HCO). The electric charge symbols of plus (+) and minus (−) indicate that the substance in question is ionic in nature and has an imbalanced distribution of electrons, the result of chemical dissociation.\\n\\nAll known higher lifeforms require a subtle and complex electrolyte balance between the intracellular and extracellular milieu. In particular, the maintenance of precise osmotic gradient of electrolytes is important. Such gradients affect and regulate the hydration of the body as well as blood pH, and are critical for nerve and muscle function. Various mechanisms exist in living species that keep the concentrations of different electrolytes under tight control.\\n\\nBoth muscle tissue and neurons are considered electric tissues of the body. Muscles and neurons are activated by electrolyte activity between the extracellular fluid or interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. Electrolytes may enter or leave the cell membrane through specialized protein structures embedded in the plasma membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction is dependent upon the presence of calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), and potassium (K). Without sufficient levels of these key electrolytes, muscle weakness or severe muscle contractions may occur.\\n\\nElectrolyte balance is maintained by oral, or in emergencies, intravenous (IV) intake of electrolyte-containing substances, and is regulated by hormone, generally with the kidney flushing out excess levels. In humans, electrolyte homeostasis is regulated by hormones such as antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone and parathyroid hormone. Serious electrolyte disturbance, such as dehydration and overhydration, may lead to cardiac and neurological complications and, unless they are rapidly resolved, will result in a medical emergency.\\n\\nMeasurement of electrolytes is a commonly performed diagnostic procedure, performed via blood test with ion selective electrode or urinalysis by medical technologist. The interpretation of these values is somewhat meaningless without analysis of the clinical history and is often impossible without parallel measurement of renal function. Electrolytes measured most often are sodium and potassium. Chloride levels are rarely measured except for arterial blood gas interpretation since they are inherently linked to sodium levels. One important test conducted on urine is the specific gravity test to determine the occurrence of electrolyte imbalance.\\n\\nIn oral rehydration therapy, electrolyte drinks containing sodium and potassium salts replenish the body's water and electrolyte levels after dehydration caused by exercise, excessive drinking, diaphoresis, diarrhea, vomiting, intoxication or starvation. Athletes exercising in extreme conditions (for three or more hours continuously e.g. marathon or triathlon) who do not consume electrolytes risk dehydration (or hyponatremia).\\n\\nA simple electrolyte drink can be home-made by using the correct proportions of water, sugar, salt, salt substitute for potassium, and baking soda. However, effective electrolyte replacements should include all electrolytes required by the body, including sodium chloride, potassium, magnesium, and calcium that can be either obtained in a sports drink or a solid electrolyte capsule.\\n\\nElectrolytes are commonly found in fruit juices, sports drink, tomato soup and many fruits and vegetables (e.g. potatoes, avocados).\\n\\nWhen electrode are placed in an electrolyte and a voltage is applied, the electrolyte will conduct electricity. Lone electron normally cannot pass through the electrolyte; instead, a chemical reaction occurs at the cathode consuming electrons from the anode. Another reaction occurs at the anode, producing electrons that are eventually transferred to the cathode. As a result, a negative charge cloud develops in the electrolyte around the cathode, and a positive charge develops around the anode.

The positively charged sodium ions Na will react towards the cathode neutralizing the negative charge of OH there, and the negatively charged oxide ions OH will react towards the anode neutralizing the positive charge of H there.

{"title": "Electromagnetic radiation", "body": "Electromagnetic radiation (often abbreviated E-M radiation or EMR) is a form of energy exhibiting wave like behavior as it travels through space. EMR has both electric and magnetic field components, which oscillate in phase perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy propagation.\\n\\nElectromagnetic radiation is classified according to the frequency of its wave. In order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength, these are radio waves, microwave, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-ray and gamma ray (see Electromagnetic spectrum). The eye of various organism sense a small and somewhat variable window of frequencies called the visible spectrum. The photon is the quantum of the electromagnetic interaction and the basic \"unit\" of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation and is also the force carrier for the electromagnetic force.\\n\\nEM radiation carries energy and momentum that may be imparted to matter with which it interacts.\\n\\nthumbJames Clerk Maxwell first formally-postulated Electromagnetic waves. These were subsequently confirmed by Heinrich Hertz. Maxwell derived a wave form of the electric and magnetic equations, thus uncovering the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields, and their symmetry. Because the speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured speed of light, Maxwell concluded that light itself is an EM wave.\\n\\nAccording to Maxwell's equations, a time-varying electric field generates a time-varying magnetic field and vice versa. Therefore, as an oscillating electric field generates an oscillating magnetic field, the magnetic field in turn generates an oscillating electric field, and so on. These oscillating fields together form a propagating electromagnetic wave.\\n\\nA quantum theory of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter such as electrons is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe physics of electromagnetic radiation is electrodynamics. Electromagnetism is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of electrodynamics. Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of superposition. Thus, a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same space due to other causes. Further, as they are vector fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition. For example, in optics two or more coherent lightwaves may interact and by constructive or destructive interference yield a resultant irradiance deviating from the sum of the component irradiances of the individual lightwaves.\\n\\nSince light is an oscillation it is not affected by travelling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum. However in nonlinear media, such as some crystal, interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields — these interactions include the Faraday effect and the Kerr effect.\\n\\nIn refraction, a wave crossing from one medium to another of different density alters its speed and direction upon entering the new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction, and is summarized by Snell's law. Light disperses into a visible spectrum as light is shone through a prism because of the wavelength dependent refractive index of the prism material (Dispersion).\\n\\nEM radiation exhibits both wave properties and particle properties at the same time (see wave-particle duality). Both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in a large number of experiments. Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than 1. Upon absorption of light, it is not too difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy. Strictly speaking, however, this alone is not evidence of \"particulate\" behavior of light, rather it reflects the quantum nature of matter. \\n\\nThere are experiments in which the wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves appear in the same experiment, such as the self-interference of a single photon. True single-photon experiments (in a quantum optical sense) can be done today in undergraduate-level labs. When a single photon is sent through an interferometer, it passes through both paths, interfering with itself, as waves do, yet is detected by a photomultiplier or other sensitive detector only once.\\n\\nthumbElectromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave meaning that the oscillations of the waves are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer and travel. An important aspect of the nature of light is frequency. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in hertz, the SI unit of frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per second. Light usually has a spectrum of frequencies which sum together to form the resultant wave. Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction.\\n\\nA wave consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the wavelength. Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:\\n\\nwhere v is the speed of the wave (c in a vacuum, or less in other media), f is the frequency and λ is the wavelength. As waves cross boundaries between different media, their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant.\\n\\nInterference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern. If the fields have components in the same direction, they constructively interfere, while opposite directions cause destructive interference.\\n\\nThe energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called radiant energy.\\n\\nBecause energy of an EM wave is quantized, in the particle model of EM radiation, a wave consists of discrete packets of energy, or quanta, called photon. The frequency of the wave is proportional to the particle's energy. Because photons are emitted and absorbed by charged particles, they act as transporters of energy. The energy per photon can be calculated from the Planck–Einstein equation:\\n\\nwhere E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is frequency.It is commonly expressed in the unit of electronvolt (eV).This photon-energy expression is a particular case of the energy levels of the more general electromagnetic oscillator, whose average energy, which is used to obtain Planck's radiation law, can be shown to differ sharply from that predicted by the equipartition principle at low temperature, thereby establishes a failure of equipartition due to quantum effects at low temperature.\\n\\nAs a photon is absorbed by an atom, it excite the atom, elevating an electron to a higher energy level. If the energy is great enough, so that the electron jumps to a high enough energy level, it may escape the positive pull of the nucleus and be liberated from the atom in a process called photoionisation. Conversely, an electron that descends to a lower energy level in an atom emits a photon of light equal to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete, each element emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies.\\n\\nTogether, these effects explain the emission and absorption spectra of light. The dark bands in the absorption spectrum are due to the atoms in the intervening medium absorbing different frequencies of the light. The composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption spectrum. For instance, dark bands in the light emitted by a distant star are due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms. A similar phenomenon occurs for emission. As the electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum is emitted that represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons. This is manifested in the emission spectrum of nebula. Today, scientists use this phenomenon to observe what elements a certain star is composed of. It is also used in the determination of the distance of a star, using the red shift.\\n\\nAny electric charge which accelerates, or any changing magnetic field, produces electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic information about the charge travels at the speed of light. Accurate treatment thus incorporates a concept known as retarded time (as opposed to advanced time, which is unphysical in light of causality), which adds to the expressions for the electrodynamic electric field and magnetic field. These extra terms are responsible for electromagnetic radiation. When any wire (or other conducting object such as an antenna) conducts alternating current, electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the electric current. At the quantum level, electromagnetic radiation is produced when the wavepacket of a charged particle oscillates or otherwise accelerates. Charged particles in a stationary state do not move, but a superposition of such states may result in oscillation, which is responsible for the phenomenon of radiative transition between quantum states of a charged particle.\\n\\nDepending on the circumstances, electromagnetic radiation may behave as a wave or as particle. As a wave, it is characterized by a velocity (the speed of light), wavelength, and frequency. When considered as particles, they are known as photon, and each has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by Planck's relation E = hν, where E is the energy of the photon, h = 6.626 × 10 J·s is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of the wave.\\n\\nOne rule is always obeyed regardless of the circumstances: EM radiation in a vacuum always travels at the speed of light, relative to the observer, regardless of the observer's velocity. (This observation led to Albert Einstein's development of the theory of special relativity.)\\n\\nIn a medium (other than vacuum), velocity factor or refractive index are considered, depending on frequency and application. Both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum.\\n\\nThe basic structure of matter involves charged particles bound together in many different ways. When electromagnetic radiation is incident on matter, it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy. The ultimate fate of this energy depends on the situation. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation. It may also get dissipated into other microscopic motions within the matter, coming to thermal equilibrium and manifesting itself as thermal energy in the material. With a few exceptions such as fluorescence, harmonic generation, photochemical reaction and the photovoltaic effect, absorbed electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by heating the material. This happens both for infrared and non-infrared radiation. Intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food. In addition to infrared lasers, sufficiently intense visible and ultraviolet lasers can also easily set paper afire. Ionizing electromagnetic radiation can create high-speed electrons in a material and break chemical bonds, but after these electrons collide many times with other atoms in the material eventually most of the energy gets downgraded to thermal energy, this whole process happening in a tiny fraction of a second. That infrared radiation is a form of heat and other electromagnetic radiation is not, is a widespread misconception in physics. Any electromagnetic radiation can heat a material when it is absorbed.\\n\\nThe inverse or time-reversed process of absorption is responsible for thermal radiation. Much of the thermal energy in matter consists of random motion of charged particles, and this energy can be radiated away from the matter. The resulting radiation may subsequently be absorbed by another piece of matter, with the deposited energy heating the material. Radiation is an important mechanism of heat transfer.\\n\\nThe electromagnetic radiation in an opaque cavity at thermal equilibrium is effectively a form of thermal energy, having maximum radiation entropy. The thermodynamic potentials of electromagnetic radiation can be well-defined as for matter. Thermal radiation in a cavity has energy density (see Planck's Law) of\\n\\nDifferentiating the above with respect to temperature, we may say that the electromagnetic radiation field has an effective volumetric heat capacity given by\\n\\nthumb[[Image:Light spectrum.png|right|frame|Legend:γ = Gamma rayHX = Hard X-raySX = Soft X-RaysEUV = Extreme ultravioletNUV = Near ultravioletVisible lightNIR = Near infraredMIR = Moderate infraredFIR = Far infraredRadio waves:EHF = Extremely high frequency (Microwaves)SHF = Super high frequency (Microwaves)UHF = Ultrahigh frequencyVHF = Very high frequencyHF = High frequencyMF = Medium frequencyLF = Low frequencyVLF = Very low frequencyVF = Voice frequencyULF = Ultra low frequencySLF = Super low frequencyELF = Extremely low frequency]]\\n\\nGenerally, EM radiation (the designation 'radiation' excludes static electric and magnetic and near fields) is classified by wavelength into radio, microwave, infrared, the visible region we perceive as light, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma rays. Arbitrary electromagnetic waves can always be expressed by Fourier analysis in terms of sinusoidal monochromatic waves which can be classified into these regions of the spectrum. \\n\\nThe behavior of EM radiation depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths. When EM radiation interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.Spectroscopy can detect a much wider region of the EM spectrum than the visible range of 400 nm to 700 nm. A common laboratory spectroscope can detect wavelengths from 2 nm to 2500 nm. Detailed information about the physical properties of objects, gases, or even stars can be obtained from this type of device. It is widely used in astrophysics. For example, hydrogen atom emit radio wave of wavelength 21.12 cm.\\n\\nSoundwaves are not electromagnetic radiation. At the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum, about 20 Hz to about 20 kHz, are frequencies that might be considered in the audio range, however, electromagnetic waves cannot be directly perceived by human ears. Sound waves are the oscillating compression of molecules. To be heard, electromagnetic radiation must be converted to air pressure waves, or if the ear is submerged, water pressure waves.\\n\\nEM radiation with a wavelength between approximately 400 nm and 700 nm is directly detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially nearby infrared (longer than 700 nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 400 nm) are also sometimes referred to as light, especially when visibility to humans is not relevant.\\n\\nIf radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the EM spectrum reflects off of an object, say, a bowl of fruit, and then strikes our eyes, this results in our visual perception of the scene. Our brain's visual system processes the multitude of reflected frequencies into different shades and hues, and through this not-entirely-understood psychophysical phenomenon, most people perceive a bowl of fruit.\\n\\nAt most wavelengths, however, the information carried by electromagnetic radiation is not directly detected by human senses. Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum, and our technology can also manipulate a broad range of wavelengths. Optical fiber transmits light which, although not suitable for direct viewing, can carry data that can be translated into sound or an image. To be meaningful both transmitter and receiver must use some agreed-upon encoding system - especially so if the transmission is digital as opposed to the analog nature of the waves.\\n\\nRadio waves can be made to carry information by varying a combination of the amplitude, frequency and phase of the wave within a frequency band.\\n\\nWhen EM radiation impinges upon a conductor, it couples to the conductor, travels along it, and induces an electric current on the surface of that conductor by exciting the electrons of the conducting material. This effect (the skin effect) is used in antennas. EM radiation may also cause certain molecules to absorb energy and thus to heat up; this is exploited in microwave oven. Radio waves are not ionizing radiation, as the energy per photon is too small.\\n\\nElectromagnetic waves as a general phenomenon were predicted by the classical laws of electricity and magnetism, known as Maxwell's equations. If you inspect Maxwell's equations without sources (charges or currents) then you will find that, along with the possibility of nothing happening, the theory will also admit nontrivial solutions of changing electric and magnetic fields. Beginning with Maxwell's equations in free space:\\n\\nOne solution,\\n\\nis trivial.\\n\\nTo see the more interesting one, we utilize vector identities, which work for any vector, as follows:\\n\\nTo see how we can use this, take the curl of equation (2):\\n\\nEvaluating the left hand side:\\n\\nEvaluate the right hand side:\\n\\nEquations (6) and (7) are equal, so this results in a vector-valued differential equation for the electric field, namely\\n\\nOr more simply:\\n\\nWhich, as it turns out, is the speed of light in vacuum. Maxwell's equations have unified the vacuum permittivity , the vacuum permeability , and the speed of light itself, c. Before this derivation it was not known that there was such a strong relationship between light and electricity and magnetism.\\n\\nBut these are only two equations and we started with four, so there is still more information pertaining to these waves hidden within Maxwell's equations. Let's consider a generic vector wave for the electric field.\\n\\nHere  is the constant amplitude,  is any second differentiable function,  is a unit vector in the direction of propagation, and is a position vector. We observe that  is a generic solution to the wave equation. In other words\\n\\nfor a generic wave traveling in the  direction.\\n\\nThis form will satisfy the wave equation, but will it satisfy all of Maxwell's equations, and with what corresponding magnetic field?\\n\\nThe first of Maxwell's equations implies that electric field is orthogonal to the direction the wave propagates.\\n\\nThe second of Maxwell's equations yields the magnetic field. The remaining equations will be satisfied by this choice of .\\n\\nNot only are the electric and magnetic field waves traveling at the speed of light, but they have a special restricted orientation and proportional magnitudes, , which can be seen immediately from the Poynting vector. The electric field, magnetic field, and direction of wave propagation are all orthogonal, and the wave propagates in the same direction as .\\n\\nFrom the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field oscillates right and left; but this picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as polarization. On a quantum level, it is described as photon polarization.\\n\\nMore general forms of the second order wave equations given above are available, allowing for both non-vacuum propagation media and sources. A great many competing derivations exist, all with varying levels of approximation and intended applications. One very general example is a form of the electric field equation, which was factorized into a pair of explicitly directional wave equations, and then efficiently reduced into a single uni-directional wave equation by means of a simple slow-evolution approximation.\\n\\npnb:بجناطیسی ریڈیایشن\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electronic gear-shifting system", "body": "rightrightAn electronic gear-shifting system is a method of changing gears on a bicycle, which enables riders to shift with electronic switch instead of using conventional control levers. The switches are connected by wire or wireless to a battery pack and to a small electric motor that drives the derailleur, switching the chain from cog to cog. An electronic system can switch gears faster, and because the system does not use Bowden cable and can calibrate itself, it may require less maintenance.\\n\\nIn 1992 the first electronically controlled gear shift mechanism, the Zap, was introduced by the French manufacturer Mavic at the 1992 Tour de France. It was a prototype, but it achieved neither technical success nor commercial application. A development of this was used by Chris Boardman to win the opening time trial (prologue) of the 1997 Tour de France.\\n\\nIn 1994 Sachs introduced the SRAM Speedtronic.\\n\\nIn 1999 Mavic introduced the Mektronic, its second electronic shift system but again without commercial application.\\n\\nDuring the 2000s both Shimano and Campagnolo (2005) experimented with electronic shifting in professional cycle races.\\n\\nThe first commercial electronic gear shift system for road bicycle was introduced by Shimano in 2009, the Di2. Three professional teams used the Di2 in the 2009 Tour of California; Columbia High Road, Garmin Slipstream, and Rabobank; and several teams and riders, including George Hincapie, used it during the 2009 Tour de France \\n\\nAlso in 2009 Giant released a bicycle equipped with the Shimano Di2 and Trek Bicycle Corporation began providing a battery mount and Di2-specific cable routing and stops on its Madone frames.\\n\\nAs of 2009, one system was commercially available from a major parts manufacturer: Shimano's Di2 (Dura-Ace 7970) for road bicycle. While the traditional method of gear shifting uses mechanical control levers that pull and release Bowden cables and spring-loaded derailleurs, Di2 is controlled by solid-state switches located either in the integrated shift levers and/or at the end of time trial bars. The switches send signals through a wiring harness to a battery pack, placed near the bottom bracket. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack supplies power to the derailleur motors, which move the derailleurs via worm gears. Shimano estimates that their 7.4-volt battery pack can last up to  per charge. The system also has an LED light to warn when it needs a charge.\\n\\nThe rear derailleur has shift times similar to mechanical systems and a break-away system to protect it in case of a crash. The front derailleur, however, switches gears almost 30% faster. On traditional bikes, the front derailleur is problematic because the chain can be under tension and has to make a large vertical jump between chainring. The electronic system's controlled motion overcomes these problems. The Di2 can also trim the front derailleur to eliminate chain rub and calibrate itself to adjust for wear and tear. Finally, the entire 7970 groupset weighs approximately  less than the 7800 it replaces but  more than the new 7900.\\n\\nAn electronic system can have several advantages over a comparable mechanical system:\\n\\nAn electronic system may have some disadvantages when compared to a mechanical system:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elena Ceauşescu", "body": "Elena Ceauşescu (; January 7, 1916 – December 25, 1989) was the wife of Romania's Communist leader Nicolae Ceauşescu, and Deputy Prime Minister of Romania.\\n\\nShe was born Elena Petrescu into a peasant family in the village of Petreşti, Baloteşti commune, Ilfov County, in the informal region of Wallachia. Her family was supported by her father's job as a ploughman. Her records show she left school only with a good mark in Needlework in primary school. After primary school, she moved along with her brother to Bucharest, where she worked as a laboratory assistant before getting a job at a textile factory. She joined the Romanian Communist Party in 1937 and met 21-year-old Nicolae Ceauşescu in 1939. They married on December 23, 1947.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nAfter the Communists took power, Ceauşescu worked as a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was an unimportant figure until her husband became general secretary of the party. Ceauşescu was fluent in French. Starting in July 1972, Elena Ceauşescu was given various offices at senior levels in the Romanian Communist Party. In June 1973 she became a member of the Politburo of the Romanian Communist Party becoming the second most important and influential person after Ceauşescu himself. She was deeply involved in party administration alongside her husband. The Ceauşescus issued strict public relations rules for all elements of their persona, which were rigidly followed.\\n\\nCeauşescu frequently accompanied her husband on official visits abroad, and it was during the state visit to the People's Republic of China in June 1971, where she noticed how Chairman Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing had her own position of real power in the state, that Elena's remarkable rise was inspired. In July 1971 she was elected a member of the Central Commission on Socio-Economic Forecasting, and in July 1972 she became a full member of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee. She was elected a member of the Executive Committee in June 1973, after being proposed by Emil Bodnăraş. In November 1974, at the 11th party congress, she was made a member of the (renamed) political executive committee and in January 1977 became a member of the highest party body, the Permanent Bureau of the Political Executive Committee. In March 1980, she was made a First Deputy Prime Minister.\\n\\nUnder her husband's regime, Ceauşescu became a major Romanian political figure. Publicly, Ceauşescu said that it was an honor to be referred to as \"comrade\", but Romanian expatriates in the United States frequently referred to her as \"Madame Ceauşescu\" with great disdain. She enjoyed being referred by the title \"Mother of the Nation.\"\\n\\nCeauşescu fled with her husband on December 22, 1989, after the events in Timişoara led to the Romanian Revolution, but she and her husband were captured in the town of Targoviste. At the show trial that took place, she answered only a few questions since her husband took a protective role, asked her to calm down and shook his head each time her mouth opened to reply in anger. On the afternoon of December 25, 1989, (Christmas Day) in Târgovişte they were executed. She was almost 74 years old.\\n\\nCeauşescu was outlived by her almost 100-year old mother, her brother Gheorghe Petrescu (also an important figure in the party) and her three children: Valentin (b. 1948), Zoia (1949–2006) and Nicu (1951–1996), who was also a very important member of the Romanian Communist Party.\\n\\nIn 1957 she was a research scientist at ICECHIM (National Institute for Chemical Research). In the early 1960s she was reported to be secretary of the party committee of the Bucharest Central Institute of Chemical Researches, and, when her husband Ceauşescu took over the party leadership in March 1965, she was listed as the institute's director. In December of the same year, she was elected a member of the newly established National Council of Scientific Research, and in September 1966 she was awarded the Order of Scientific Merit First Class.\\n\\nCeauşescu was given many honorary awards for scientific achievement in the field of polymer chemistry during the period when her husband ruled Romania. However, her educational and scientific achievements are disputed.\\n\\nDespite never finishing an elementary education (her records show that she left school with only a good mark in needlework), Ceauşescu graduated from the University of Bucharest with a PhD in polymer chemistry and top in a class of 100 women with the honor of summa cum laude. Her thesis has 162 pages, 32 tables, 40 figures and 440 references and describes the invention of a very valuable artificial material. Critics consider it unlikely that a textile worker would have been able to write a thesis in chemistry. After the Revolution of 1989, several scientists have claimed that Elena had forced them to write papers in her name while a later report from her instructors claims she had rarely attended lectures or classes, and there were also disputes over whether she was literate. Allegedly, she was once thrown out of an adult education chemistry exam for cheating. Claims have also arisen that the university gave her the honor of the doctorate solely because of her political position.\\n\\nMost of the respected academic institutions and universities in the West refused to acknowledge her alleged academic merit. She was made a member of the Illinois Academy of Sciences. Elena Ceauşescu later complained that she never heard of Illinois and that the membership was given by the \"dirty Jew\". President of the Academy of Sciences was Jewish-American chemist Emanuel Merdinger at that time. She allegedly obtained these awards with money, instead of merit.\\n\\nIn March 1974, she was made a member of the Romanian Academy's Section for Chemical Sciences. At the time when she wanted to receive her doctorate from the Bucharest Faculty of Chemistry, she met with strong opposition from respected Romanian chemist Costin D. Neniţescu, the dean of the faculty. She was forced instead to present her thesis to Cristofor Simionescu and Ioan Ursu at the University of Iasi, where she met with complete success.\\n\\nShe was sometimes nicknamed \"Codoi\", referring to her alleged mispronunciation of the name of the chemical compound CO, being mocked by many, including an official during her show trial. \"Codoi\" also means \"big tail\" in Romanian, therefore the comic effect created by her alleged mispronunciation.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eleutheran Adventurers", "body": "The Eleutheran Adventurers were a group of English Puritan and religious Independents who left Bermuda to settle on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas in the late 1640s. This group represents the first concerted European effort to colonize the Bahamas – no effort was made while the islands were under Spanish rule – but their claim to the islands would not survive the political turmoil of the Restoration in England.\\n\\nThe mid-17th century was a period of constant religious and political turmoil in England and in Europe which culminated in the English Civil War fought between the king, Charles I and Parliament, represented by the Puritan Oliver Cromwell. This conflict spread to Bermuda where a period of civil strife resulted in a victory for the supporters of the Royalist party in the English Civil War. The struggle eventually led to the expulsion of those who did not swear allegiance to the Crown, particularly the colony's Puritans and independents. The small group of Puritan settlers, led by a man named William Sayle, searched for a place in which they could freely practice their faith.\\n\\nThe English had laid claim to the Bahamas in 1629, in the midst of the English Civil War, but had made no permanent settlements. In 1644 the Bermuda Puritans sent an expedition to explore these new islands, but one vessel was lost and the other failed to find a suitable island. Nevertheless, sometime between spring 1646 and autumn 1648, Sayle took some seventy people to settle in the Bahamas. They made landfall on the island called Cigateo, which they named Eleutheria, from the Greek word for \"freedom\", although the name later became Eleuthera. The island's original inhabitants, the Lucayan, had been decimated through the slaving activities of the Spanish and the numerous European diseases, especially smallpox, that followed.\\n\\nThe colony was not an immediate success. Its soil yielded little production and the settlers barely got by during their first years. Sayle, however, was a very resourceful man, and secured a number of supplies from the mainland colonies. Despite this the colony did not do much better in the following years and in the end only a few hardcore settlers from the original Eleutherans were left. Sayle himself went on to become Governor of South Carolina, but continued to have a vested personal interest in Eleuthera. He used this influence to secure some trade for the island and so helped the community through its infancy.\\n\\n"}

In 1952, the site became an outdoor museum and the Hagley Museum and Library was founded.\\n\\nJacob Broom built a cotton mill on the site in 1795.

I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. The company was founded in 1802 by E.I. du Pont, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution.\\n\\nthumbThey set up the Eleutherian gunpowder mill on the Brandywine Creek just north of Wilmington, Delaware, based on gunpowder machinery bought from France and site plans for a gunpowder mill supplied by the French Government. They also built housing for 30 workers.\\n\\nStarting, initially, by reworking damaged gunpowder and refining saltpetre for the US Government they quickly moved into gunpowder manufacture.\\n\\nSaltpetre was refined in an area between the house and the mills that now is occupied by a formal garden. Charcoal was produced from the willow trees that lined the Brandywine.\\n\\nBy the end of 1804, DuPont had sold 39,000 pounds of powder; the following year sales tripled. The Federal government and John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company became regular customers. In 1813 the Hagley property, just downstream from the original mills, was purchased, doubling the size and capacity of the mills. Sales grew during the Mexican-American War and the Crimean War.

Stables, offices, a machine shop, and a steam powerhouse from the late 19th century also were located in the complex, as was a narrow gauge railway.\\n\\nAfter the introduction of smokeless powder, the mills were to be closed in the 1910s, but were kept open at the request of the Federal government until after the end of World War I.\\n\\nIn 1952 family members donated  of land and the DuPont company established a $6,000,000 endowment for the Eleutherian Mill-Hagley Foundation for a museum of industrial history.\\n\\nThe site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966.\\n\\nIt is located on Delaware Route 141 at the Tyler Mcconnell Bridge spanning the Brandywine Creek.\\n\\n"}

Hafiz said that this was not true in a 2001 interview in which he said that such a friendship would be impossible given the fact that he had been in Moscow until 1962. After Hafiz became Prime Minister, Eli may have even been considered for the position of Syrian Deputy Minister of Defense, though Hafiz's secretary has denied that this was the case.\\n\\nAdditionally, Cohen suggested that eucalyptus trees should be planted around Syrian military bunkers and mortars on the Golan Heights that were targeting Israel. That way Cohen argued, the trees would provide natural cover for the outposts (eucalyptus trees grow very quickly), preventing soldiers and personnel from suffering the effects of heatstroke. After his suggestion was implemented by the Syrian military, Cohen passed on the information to Israeli intelligence, then the Israeli Air Force (IAF)—using the newly planted trees as a guide—easily destroyed the majority of those bases during the Six-Day War. The mature trees are still evident today when visiting the sites.\\n\\nCohen also learned of an important secret Syrian plan to have three lines of bunkers and mortars right behind each other in order to trick the Israeli military, which would expect only one.\\n\\nrightIn January 1965, hired Soviet experts caught him in the act of sending a radio message after large amounts of radio interference brought attention. After a trial, he was found guilty of espionage. Despite many appeals, including from Pope Paul VI and the governments of France, Belgium and Canada, to persuade the Syrian government to commute the death sentence, he was publicly hanged by Syria on 18 May 1965. \\n\\nAccording to his brother and fellow Mossad agent, Maurice Cohen, Eli Cohen was third in line to succeed as president of Syria at the time he was discovered.\\n\\nRequests by his family for his remains to be returned to Israel have been denied by the Syrian government (as of May 2006). In February 2007 a Turkish official confirmed that his government was ready to act as a mediator for the return of Eli's remains to his family from Syria. In August 2008 the former bureau chief of late Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad, Monthir Maosily, said that Eli Cohen's burial site is unknown, claiming that the Syrians buried the executed Israeli spy three times, to stop the remains from being brought back to Israel via a special operation. \\n\\nEli's brothers, Abraham and Maurice Cohen led the campaign to return his remains. Maurice died in 2006. Eli's widow, Nadia, has since led the campaign. \\n\\nThe film The Impossible Spy is a depiction of his life. He is featured at the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C.\\n\\narz:إيلي كوهين\\n\\n"}

He is best known for the 2002 film Divine Intervention (), a modern tragic comedy on living under occupation in the Palestinian territories which won the Jury Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. Elia Suleiman's cinematic style is often compared to that of Jacques Tati and Buster Keaton, for its poetic interplay between \"burlesque and sobriety\".\\n\\nBetween 1982–1993, Suleiman lived in New York City, where he co-directed: Introduction to the End of an Argument (1990) and directed Homage by Assassination, that both won numerous awards. \\n\\nAn experimental video film, co-directed by Jayce Salloum, Introduction to the End of an Argument critiqued the portrayal of Arabs in Western media and its effect on foreign policy by juxtaposing clips from Hollywood films, television broadcasts and cartoons with live scenes (shot by Salloum) from the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nHomage by Assassination is a \"diary film\" that critiques the 1991 Gulf War via the juxtaposition of multilayered personal anecdotes and identity. The film offers a lucid portrait of what Ella Shohat and Robert Stam have termed \"cultural disembodiment,\" manifested in \"multiple failures of communication,\" that reflect the contradictions of a \"diasporic subject.\"\\n\\nIn 1994, Suleiman moved to Jerusalem and began teaching at Birzeit University in the West Bank. He was entrusted with the task of developing a Film and Media Department at the university with funding support from the European Commission. In 2008 Elia Suleiman became a professor at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee. He continues to guest lecture in other universities around the world.\\n\\nIn 1996, Suleiman directed Chronicle of a Disappearance, his first feature film. It won the Best First Film Prize at the 1996 Venice Film Festival.\\n\\nIn 2002, Suleiman's second feature film, Divine Intervention, subtitled, A Chronicle of Love and Pain, won the Jury Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and the International Critics Prize (FIPRESCI) , also receiving the Best Foreign Film Prize at the European Awards in Rome.\\n\\nHis latest film is called The Time That Remains, which competed in the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Suleiman won the Black Pearl prize for best Middle Eastern narrative film at the Middle Eastern Film Festival in Abu Dhabi on October 17, 2009. The film won the Critics Prize from Argentinean Film Critics Association “Because of her artistic mastery and the magnificent approach with which she exhibits, from a personal point of view, her own people’s history and pain.” at Mar del Plata International Film Festival.\\n\\nIn his 1998 film, The Arab Dream (\"Al Hilm Al-Arabi\") Suleiman autobiographically explores issues of identity, expressing that: \"I don't have a homeland to say I live in exile... I live in postmortem... daily life, daily death.\" Suleiman also produced a short film in 1997, entitled War and Peace in Vesoul. \\n\\nIn 2000, Suleiman released the 15-minute short film \"Cyber Palestine\" which follows a modern-day Mary and Joseph as they attempt to cross from Gaza into Bethlehem. \\n\\nSuleiman was part of the nine person jury for the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eliashib (High Priest)", "body": "Eliashib the High Priest is mentioned in Nehemiah 12:10,22 and 3:1, 20-21,13:28 and possibly the Book of Ezra 10:6 of the Hebrew Bible. Some also place him in different parts of Nehemiah including 12:23 and 13:4,7, but this is disputed. Nehemiah 3:20-21 places his home between the area of two working groups constructing the walls of Jerusalem on the north side of the city. He helped with the refortification of this wall (Neh 3:1). The size of his house indicated his wealth and high socio-economic status (Neh 3:23-21). This places him as someone who lived during the time of Nehemiah, and as a result, probably Ezra also. In the year 445 BCE, Eliashib was the high priest when Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem in the 20th year of Artaxerxes I (Nehemiah 1:1, 2:1).\\n\\nJosephus puts Eliashib as a contemporary of Ezra during the reign of Xerxes, in Ant. 11.5,6-8. He also dates his reign as high priest through the reign of Cyrus, also called by the Greeks, Artaxerxes. This is the Artaxerxes depicted in the Book of Esther. Josephus outlines this story in Antiq.11:185- Antiq 11:297. The last quotation of this story states, \"When Eliasib the high priest was dead, his son Judas succeeded in the high priesthood.\"(Antiq 11:297)\\n\\nEliashib's grandson was married to the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite (Neh 13:28), and while Nehemiah was absent in Babylon Eliashib had leased the storerooms of the temple to Sanballat's associate Tobiah the Ammonite, thereby depriving the Levites of their rations. When Nehemiah returned he threw Tobiah's furniture out of the temple and drove out Eliashib's grandson (Neh 13:4-9). This may be the political background to the allegorical vision of Satan, the Angel of the Lord and Eliashib's (possibly deceased) grandfather Joshua the High Priest in Zechariah 3.\\n\\n"}

Raised in a privileged area of London, she learned art and drawing as part of her upper-class education. Inspired by Curtis's The Botanical Magazine and the Royal Horticultural Society at Chiswick gardens, Elizabeth began drawing plant and flower; she practised by making sketches from works in the Dulwich Picture Gallery, and toured famous museums thanks to her father's patronage.\\n\\nShe wrote and illustrated a number of books on the subject, most notably the two-volume Illustrations of the Natural Order of Plants (volume I in 1849, volume II in 1855), which included a total of 160 hand-coloured lithographs, royal folio, reportedly based on observation at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew and at Lexden Park in Colchester. Interestingly, the subsequent 1868 quarto edition features cheaper colour-printed plates, demonstrating the transition from expensive hand-colouring to a lower-quality, cheaper alternative.\\n\\nElizabeth Twining lived in the old family residence of Dial House, in Twickenham. She died in 1889, and by her will, Dial house was given to the people of Twickenham for use as the vicarage. Most of her original artwork is now part of the collection of the British Museum.\\n\\nApart from her artistic endeavours, Elizabeth Twining was a notable philanthropist. She set up and managed a temperance hall in Portugal Street, renovated the parish almshouses near her Twickenham home (a fact commemorated by a plaque on Saint Mary's church, Twickenham), and, after a long association with King's College Hospital, she established the Saint John's hospital for the treatment of the poor. She was the first to organise \"mothers meetings\" in London, for which she wrote Ten Years in a Ragged School and Readings for Mothers Meetings'', and contributed to the founding of Bedford College for Women by Elizabeth Jesser Reid.\\n\\n"}

Innisfail in the Johnstone Shire (population 18,000, town of 8,000) is positioned in the heart of the Cassowary Coast and is situated 88 km south of Cairns and 260 km north of Townsville. Both these cities offer direct air access to overseas markets.\\n\\nElla Bay lies within the traditional country of the Mamu peoples, an Australian Aboriginal tribe with a number of distinctive clan groups. These clan groups have cultural and spiritual ties to coastal lowlands, coastal lands and waters within what is now known as the northern part of the Cassowary Coast region of north eastern Queensland, Australia. Before colonisation, Mamu people moved seasonally within their traditional country, accessing and using important food sources including seafoods, freshwater fish, game animals, rainforest fruits and roots. Certain plant species used by rainforest Aboriginal tribes in this area on a regular basis are highly toxic, and careful preparation using time honoured methods were employed to make these food sources safe for eating. During particular seasons, these toxic foods would form a staple of the tribes' diets. In some locations, early European visitors (for example the anthropologist Roth) recorded seeing communal settlements with multiple shelters including long-house type structures, and there is evidence that a taro-type species of yam was cultivated for regular harvest along creeks and rivers. Like so many Aboriginal people in Australia, many Mamu traditional owners were forcibly removed from their traditional lands to other places in Queensland including Cherbourg, Woorabinda, Yarrabah and Palm Island mission settlements. Some have come back to live in the area since the mid-20th century.\\n\\nThe area around Ella Bay was first colonised by Europeans in the mid-19th century, and following an influx or timber cutters after the local red ceder species (Toona ciliata), quickly became a key growing area for bananas and sugar cane. The later industries persist into the present day. The main township in the Ella Bay area is Innisfail, located some 85 km south of Cairns.\\n\\nAt the landscape scale, the mountain ranges encircling Ella Bay itself lie mostly within the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area (the Wet Tropics of north east Queensland), a globally recognised place for its natural environment. Parts of Ella Bay are protected within the Ella Bay National Park. The ocean directly offshore at Ella Bay lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which is also the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. There are two blocks of private land at the southern end of Ella Bay, at least one of which is a previous lease for grazing turned into freehold tenure at the end of the Joh Bejielke Petersen era (former Queensland Premier during 1960s - 1980s). These blocks are subject to large-scale luxury resort and residential developments.\\n\\nThe Ella Bay area is home to a large and stunning variety of plant and animal life including iconic species like the endangered southern Cassowary (Casuarius casuarius johnsonii), endangered and vulnerable frog species (Asutralian Lacelid, Common Mist Frog, Waterfall Frog), remnant native plants and estuarine (saltwater) crocodiles. The beach at Ella Bay is a commonly used nesting beach for endangered marine species including Green and Flatback turtles, and the waters off Ella Bay are home to dugong, dolphins (including Irrawaddy and snub-nosed dolphin species) and whales. The average annual rainfall at Innisfail is over 3500mm or 3.5m (Bureau of Meteorology, Australia), and the average number of rainy days per year is 150 days.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elliotts of Newbury", "body": "Elliotts of Newbury was a British company that became well-known for manufacturing gliders\\n\\nThe company was founded by Samuel Elliott in 1870 as a joinery works as \"Elliott’s Moulding and Joinery Company Ltd\" It produced ammunition boxes during the First World War made by a workforce of 90 per cent women. It changed to furniture production after the war. In the Second World War, once more a largely female workforce produced components for aircraft, including the Supermarine Spitfire, Tiger Moth, De Havilland Mosquito, the Airspeed Oxford and the Airspeed Horsa glider. Elliotts built about one third of the total Horsa production and it was also responsible for a powered version of the General Aircraft Hamilcar glider. \\n\\nthumbAt the end of the war, the firm had hoped to resume furniture manufacture but in those times of austerity this was not allowed by the Board of Trade. The company therefore planned to continue with aircraft production. Its first product was the Elliotts Newbury Eon four-seat light aircraft. However the company had also been asked in 1945 by Chilton Aircraft Ltd to make one set of wings for the Chilton Olympia, a glider that was a copy of the DFS Olympia Meise. To maintain employment, Elliotts retained the right to the wing jigs they had made. Chilton was unable to make more gliders by itself without the jigs from Elliotts, and so Chilton gave up all aircraft work, agreeing to sell to Elliotts the production rights, fuselage jigs, and work in hand on all their Olympia gliders. Production of the EoN Olympia commenced in 1946 as a batch of 100, and the first flight was made in January 1947. \\n\\nThe Olympia was followed in 1948 by the production of two further German-designed gliders, the Grunau Baby 2b known as the Baby EoN and the SG38 Schulgleiter primary glider known as the Primary EoN. Elliotts and their design consultants Aviation & Engineering Products Ltd made improvements to each of the designs before starting production. \\n\\nThe prototype of the Newbury Eon light aircraft made its first flight in August 1947. Aviation & Engineering Projects Ltd also worked with Elliotts on an abortive side-by-side trainer project, the Eon T.16/48 derived from the four seater but no further aircraft were produced. However the company acted as a sub-contractor making parts for other aircraft. The Primary flew in 1948 and 80 had been built when production ceased in 1958.\\n\\nAfter building three marks of the Olympia, another improved version, called the EoN Olympia 4, later known as the 401, was built in 1954 and this was followed by the 402 in 1956, the 403 in 1957, and in 1958 by the Open Class EoN Olympia 419 and the EoN Olympia 415 for the fifteen-metre FAI Standard Class. The 415 did not go into production, and only eight 419s were built. \\n\\nThe EoN Olympia 460 was built in 1961 as a completely new Standard Class glider. A special version, the EoN Olympia 465, was developed for the 1965 World Gliding Championships.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1965 the Managing Director of Elliotts, Horace Buckingham, died. The company reviewed its business and decided that glider production was unprofitable. Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd agreed to take over the production of EoN sailplanes in 1966, but no Elliott designed glider was ever built by them, though spares were supplied and repairs were undertaken.\\n\\nElliotts closed in 1974. The factory was demolished in the late 1970s to make way for Bayer's UK headquarters.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elliptic curve only hash", "body": "The elliptic curve only hash (ECOH) algorithm was submitted as a candidate for SHA-3 in the NIST hash function competition. However, it was rejected in the beginning of the competition since a second pre-image attack was found. \\n\\nThe ECOH is based on the MuHASH hash algorithm, that has not yet been successfully attacked. However, MuHASH is too inefficient for practical use and changes had to be made. The main difference is that where MuHASH applies a random oracle, ECOH applies a padding function. Assuming random oracles, finding a collision in MuHASH implies solving the discrete logarithm problem. MuHASH is thus a provably secure hash, i.e. we know that finding a collision is at least as hard as some hard known mathematical problem. \\n\\nECOH does not use random oracles and its security is not strictly directly related to the discrete logarithm problem, yet it is still based on mathematical functions. ECOH is related to the Semaev's problem of finding low degree solutions to the summation polynomial equations over binary field, called the Summation Polynomial Problem. An efficient algorithm to solve this problem has not been given so far. Although the problem was not proven to be NP-hard, it is assumed that such an algorithm does not exist. Under certain assumptions, finding a collision in ECOH may be also viewed as an instance of the subset sum problem. Besides solving the Summation Polynomial Problem, there exists another way how to find second pre-images and thus collisions, Wagner's generalized birthday attack. \\n\\nECOH is a nice example of hash function that is based on mathematical functions (with the provable security approach) rather than on classical \"ad-hoc\" mixing of bits to obtain the hash.\\n\\nGiven , ECOH divides the message  into  blocks . If the last block is incomplete, it is padded with single 1 and then appropriate number of 0. Let furthermore  be a function that maps a message block and an integer to an elliptic curve point. Then using the mapping , each block is transformed to an elliptic curve point , and these points are added together with two more points. One additional point  contains the padding and depends only on the message length. The second additional point  depends on the message length and the XOR of all message blocks. The result is truncated to get the hash . \\n\\nThe two extra points are computed by  and  .  adds all the elliptic curve points and the two extra points together. Finally, the result is passed through an output transformation function f to get the hash result . To read more about this algorithm, see the Elliptic Curve Only Hash\".\\n\\nFour ECOH algorithms were proposed, ECOH-224, ECOH-256, ECOH-384 and ECOH-512. The number represents the size of the message digest. They differ in the length of parameters, block size and in the used elliptic curve. The first two uses the elliptic curve B-283: , with parameters (128, 64, 64). ECOH-384 uses the curve B-409: , with parameters (192, 64, 64). ECOH-512 uses the curve B-571: , with parameters (256, 128, 128). It can hash messages of bit length up to .\\n\\nThe ECOH hash functions are based on concrete mathematical functions. They were designed such that the problem of finding collisions should be reducible to a known and hard mathematical problem (the subset sum problem). It means that if one could find collisions, one would be able to solve the underlying mathematical problem which is assumed to be hard and unsolvable in polynomial time. Functions with these properties are known provably secure and are quite unique among the rest of hash functions. Nevertheless second pre-image (and thus a collision) was later found because the assumptions given in the proof were too strong.\\n\\nOne way of finding collisions or second pre-images is solving Semaev Summation Polynomials. For a given elliptic curve E, there exists polynomials  that are symmetric in  variables and that vanish exactly when evaluated at abscissae of points whose sum is 0 in . So far, an efficient algorithm to solve this problem does not exist and it assumed assumed to be hard (but not proven to be NP-hard). \\n\\nMore formally: Let  be a finite field,  be an elliptic curve with Weierstrass equation having coefficients in  and  be the point of infinity. It is known that there exists a multivariable polynomial  if and only if there exist <  such that . This polynomial has degree  in each variable. The problem is to find this polynomial.\\n\\nThe problem of finding collisions in ECOH is similar to the subset sum problem. Solving a subset sum problem is almost as hard as the discrete logarithm problem. It is generally assumed that this is not doable in polynomial time. However a significantly loose heuristic must be assumed, more specifically, one of the involved parameters in the computation is not necessarily random but has a particular structure. If one adopts this loose heuristic, then finding an internal ECOH collision may be viewed as an instance of the subset sum problem. \\n\\nA second pre-image attack exists in the form of generalized birthday attack. \\n\\nDescription of the attack: This is a Wagner’s Generalized Birthday Attack. It requires 2 time for ECOH-224 and ECOH-256, 2 time for ECOH-384, and 2 time for ECOH-512. The attack sets the checksum block to a fixed value and uses a collision search on the elliptic curve points. For this attack we have a message M and try to find a M' that hashes to the same message. We first split the message length into six blocks. So . Let K be a natural number. We choose K different numbers for  and define  by . We compute the K corresponding elliptic curve points  and store them in a list. We then choose K different random values for , define , we compute , and store them in a second list. Note that the target Q is known.  only depends on the length of the message which we have fixed.  depends on the length and the XOR of all message blocks, but we choose the message blocks such that this is always zero. Thus,  is fixed for all our tries.\\n\\nIf K is larger than the square root of the number of points on the elliptic curve thenwe expect one collision between the two lists. This gives us a message  with:This means that this message leads to the target value Q and thus to a second preimage, which was the question. The workload we have to do here is two times K partial hash computations. For more info, see \"A Second Pre-image Attack Against Elliptic Curve Only Hash (ECOH)\".\\n\\nActual parameters:\\n\\nThe official comments on ECOH included a proposal called ECOH2 that doubles the elliptic curve size in an effort to stop the Halcrow-Ferguson second preimage attack with a prediction of improved or similar performance.\\n\\nProvably secure cryptographic hash function\\n\\n"}

A member and direct descendant of the royal family of the Narragansett Indian tribe of Rhode Island, he also participated in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He was scheduled to participate in the 1940 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, but these were canceled due to the outbreak of World War II. Tarzan Brown is still 1 of only 2 Native Americans to have won the Boston Marathon (the other was Thomas Longboat of the Onondaga Nation in 1907) and the only Native American to have more than 1 victory in Boston. He was inducted into the American Indian Hall of Fame in 1973.\\n\\nTarzan Brown won the Boston Marathon in 1936 and 1939. He took off so fast in the 1936 Boston marathon that the press followed the second runner, John A. Kelley, until the 20 mile mark where Kelley caught up to Tarzan. As Kelley overtook Tarzan—an amazing feat given the steady record break pace Tarzan had set—Kelley patted Tarzan on the back. What followed was a struggle between Tarzan, who took the lead on the downhills, and Kelley, who took the lead on the uphills, until finally Tarzan took the lead again to win the race. This struggle inspired reporter Jerry Nason to name the last Newton hill Heartbreak Hill because Tarzan \"broke Kelley's heart.\"\\n\\nIn the 1939, Brown was the first runner to break the 2:30 mark on the Boston Course. After the 17-mile mark in this race he also broke every checkpoint record. In 1939 Brown entered two different 26-mile races within 24 hours of one another, and he won both races. \\n\\nTarzan was also renowned for his antics during the Boston Marathon. In his first appearance as a runner in the Boston Marathon in 1935, he arrived in an outfit sewn together from one of his mother's old dresses by his sisters and he had sneakers that were falling apart. Approximately halfway through the Boston Marathon, Tarzan removed his sneakers and threw them into the crowd and ran the rest of the race barefoot (a total of 13 miles barefoot) and finished 13th. Then in the 1938 running of the Boston Marathon, Tarzan was leading on what was an unseasonably warm day when midway through the race, he ran off the road, waved to the crowd and jumped into Lake Cochituate to swim and cool off. After a while, Tarzan returned and ran the rest of the course, though other runners had already long since passed by. Most notably, fellow Rhode Islander Les Pawson (of Pawtucket) won that year. Pawson was one of Tarzan's top rivals. Tarzan was also seen arriving just minutes before the start of the 1939 Boston Marathon eating hot dogs and drinking milkshakes just before the race and claimed that he had missed breakfast.\\n\\nTarzan was born and raised by Byron and Grace (Babcock) Brown in poverty on the Narragansett Indian reservation in Charlestown, Rhode Island with his brothers Franklin, Clifford and Elwin and his sisters Myra, Alice \"Nina\" and Grace. In addition to running, he worked as a stone mason and a shellfisherman. He married a fellow Narragansett Indian named Ethel (Wilcox) Brown and had four children. He was killed in 1975 when a van hit him outside a bar in Westerly, Rhode Island.\\n\\n"}

Originally a private business academy, it later became a four-year college, a music conservatory, and a public junior college before being absorbed into the Iowa Valley Community College District.\\n\\nIn September 2007, The Washington Monthly's prestigious college rankings rated Ellsworth as the 17th best community college in the nation. Ellsworth was the only Iowa community college rated in the nation's top 30 by The Washington Monthly.\\n\\nEllsworth Community College offers three distinct degree programs. Arts and Science Degrees are two-year degrees geared toward students who wish to enter the professional workforce but do not plan to earn a degree from a four-year college. Some of the credits earned under this degree program can be transferred to a four-year university, however. Career/Technical Degrees & Diplomas provide hands-on training in a wide variety of vocational fields. The course of study lasts anywhere from nine months to two years. Associate in Arts Degrees are intended for students who plan to continue their education at a four-year college. The coursework for these degrees is identical to that offered during the freshman and sophomore years at the three state universities in Iowa; any student who transfers into one of those universities having earned an associate's degree will be automatically granted junior (third-year) standing.\\n\\nEllsworth Community College competes in eleven intercollegiate sports as a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). The Ellsworth football team has won two NJCAA national Panthers. The sports offered for men are football, basketball, wrestling, golf, and baseball. The women's sports are volleyball, basketball, golf, and softball. Cross country is considered coed. The school competes in the competitive Iowa Community College Athletic Conference at the Division 1 and 2 level.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elves in fantasy fiction and games", "body": "In many works of modern fantasy, elves are a race of semi-divine humanoid beings.\\n\\nModern fantasy literature has revived the elves as a race of semi-divine beings of human stature who are friendly with animals. Fantasy elves are different from Norse elves, but are more fat– they are unlikely to sneak in at night and help a cobbler mend his shoes because they are so fat and lazy. Fantasy elves differ in many ways from the traditional elves found in middle earth folklore and Victorian era literature; although in particular, the álfar of Norse mythology has influenced the concept of elves in fantasy.\\n\\nA hallmark of fantasy elves is also their long and pointed ear (a convention begun with a note of Tolkien's that the ears of elves were \"leaf-shaped\"). The length and shape of these ears varies depending on the artist or medium in question. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (popularized by the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game) tend to be more beautiful and wiser than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions. Often elves do not possess facial or body hair, and are consequently perceived to be androgynous.\\n\\nHalf-elves and divergent races of elves, such as high elves and dark elves, were also popularized at this time; in particular, the evil drow of Dungeons &amp; Dragons have inspired the dark elves of many other works of fantasy.\\n\\nEarly pioneers of the genre such as Lord Dunsany in The King of Elfland's Daughter and Poul Anderson in The Broken Sword featured Norse-style elves. However, the Elves (capitalized, since they are considered a nationality of sorts) found in the works of the 20th-century philologist and fantasy writer J. R. R. Tolkien have formed the view of elves in modern fantasy like no other singular source.\\n\\nThe first appearance of modern fantasy elves occurred in The King of Elfland's Daughter a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The next modern work featuring elves was The Hobbit, a 1937 novel by J. R. R. Tolkien. Elves played a major role in many of Tolkien's later works, notably The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien's elves were followed by grim Norse-style elves of human size in Poul Anderson's 1954 fantasy novel The Broken Sword.\\n\\nTolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954–1955) became astoundingly popular and was extensively imitated. In the 1960s and afterwards, elves similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing game. Tolkien's Elves were enemies of goblins (orcs) and had a long-standing quarrel with the Dwarves; these motifs would re-appear in derivative works.\\n\\nThough Tolkien originally conceived his Elves as more fairy-like than they afterwards became, he also based them on the god-like and human-sized Ljósálfar of Norse mythology. His Elves were conceived as a race of beings similar in appearance to humans but fairer and wiser, with greater spiritual powers, keener senses, and a closer empathy with nature. They are great smiths and fierce warriors on the side of good.\\n\\nTolkien's Elves of Middle-earth are immortal in the sense that they are not vulnerable to disease or the effects of old age (closer to the concept of indefinite lifespan than true immortality). Although they can be killed in battle like humans and may alternately wither away from grief, their spirits only pass to the blessed land in the west called Valinor, whereas humans' souls leave the world entirely.\\n\\nTolkien is also responsible for reviving the older and less-used terms elven and elvish rather than Edmund Spenser's invented elfin and elfish (when editors corrected the term to the latter, Tolkien himself was quick to write a correction into the next printing). He probably preferred the word elf over fairy because elf is of Anglo-Saxon origin while fairy entered English from French. He certainly felt the need to differentiate elves, as only one kind of the creatures of Faërie, from other inhabitants of that land, and lamented the confusion in English between Fairy (i.e., Faërie) and fairy (i.e., fay or elf). Tolkien also wished to distinguish his elves from the diminutive airy-winged fairies popularized by Drayton’s Nymphidia.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThough Tolkien originally conceived his Elves as more gnome-like than they afterwards became, he also based them on the god-like and human-sized ljósálfar of Norse mythology. He conceived a race of beings similar to humans but fairer and wiser, with greater spiritual powers, keener senses, and a closer empathy with nature. Like nearly all others in Middle-earth, rarely do the Elves display any kind of \"active\" magic found in later fantasy works, but are nonetheless deemed \"magic\" by the lesser races, such as the Hobbits, due to their vast number of superhuman abilities, including unnaturally keen senses (such as sharper hearing and sight, even to the point of night vision), enhanced physical strength, the ability to rest the mind and travel simultaneously, the gift of foresight, the power to peer into the minds of others and perceive their deepest desires and longings, the power to control nature to some extent, such as summoning floods, and the power to conjure visions of the past, present and future in basins of enchanted water. Items made by the elves also seem to have enhanced properties, such as the reinvigorating beverage miruvor, the unusual hithlain rope, which is strong, tough, light, long, soft to the hand, packs close and, at Sam's spoken command, unknotted itself when Sam failed to do so, and the appealing bread known as lembas, which is said to be capable of keeping a \"traveller on his feet for a day of long labour\". The elven-cloaks the Fellowship receive from the Elves were thought to be \"magic cloaks\" by Pippin, and although the Elves neither confirmed nor denied this, they said that the cloaks are \"a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes\", which is proven when the cloaks conceal Frodo and Sam so well that even Gollum could not detect them (functioning similarly to the Cloak of invisibility often used in works of fiction). Lord Thranduil of the Mirkwood Elves used \"magic doors\" to guard his palace, making it almost impossible for anyone to enter or exit against his will. Certain gifts Galadriel gave to the Fellowship of the Ring, such as Frodo's Phial and Sam's box of earth from the gardens of Galadriel, also seem to possess magical properties. This Elven \"magic\" is different from the power of Sauron, as Galadriel stated to Frodo and Sam. They are great craftsmen, smiths, and fierce warriors on the side of good. Tolkien's Elves are still very much \"human,\" and although they can be killed by injury or die of grief, and they do age (besides \"emotional aging,\" the males grow beards upon reaching a \"third cycle of life,\" though these beards never reach the glory of an adolescent dwarf woman), dead Elves are normally re-embodied after an indefinite period of time — according to Tolkien's ''Letters'' and other posthumously published writings.\\n\\nIn the posthumously published The Silmarillion, Tolkien sorted his Elves into two main kindreds: the Eldar and the Avari. The Eldar were divided into three groups: the Vanyar, the Noldor and the Teleri. In Tolkien's writings, the Noldor, the Sindar and the Silvan Elves, the last two being subdivisions of the Teleri, are the most prominent.\\n\\nIn \"Laws and Customs among the Eldar\", published in The History of Middle-earth, Tolkien elaborates on Elvish sexuality, reproduction, and sexual norms. At least the Eldar elves view the sexual act as extremely special and intimate, for it leads to the conception and birth of children. Extramarital and premarital sex would be considered contradictions in terms, and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Despite their longevity, the Eldar have generally few children with relatively sizable intervals between each child (their numbers are stated to be in steady decline by the Third Age). Their libido eventually wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the \"union of love\", and they consider the period of bearing and raising children as the happiest stage of their lives.\\n\\nPost-Tolkien fantasy elves (popularized by the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game) tend to be beautiful, fair, slender, and close in size to humans (usually taller, sometimes shorter). A hallmark of fantasy elves is also their long and pointed ears. In gaming, and to some extent fantasy literature, elves as a rule have a greater depth of knowledge (especially regarding magic) than their human counterparts, due to a racial inclination as well as their extreme age. Typically, they are also capable warriors, especially skilled in archery, following Legolas, arguably Tolkien's most well-known elf.\\n\\nAs in the Norse lore, elven-human unions and offspring were possible in Tolkien's saga (a notable example being Elrond, the lord of Rivendell), and in many RPGs, half-elven is a possible race for player character. Fantasy elves frequently divide up into subraces, such as the High Elves, Wood Elves and Dark Elves found in the Warhammer Fantasy game setting. Especially dark elves (popularized by TSR as drow) are a common theme in many other fantasy games and to some extent literature. Apart from malice, drow or dark elves are often depicted as being dark-skinned and living underground. The evil dark-skinned elf, and good pale blond elf was reversed with the Blood Elves and Night Elves in World Of Warcraft.\\n\\nIn the modern treatment of elves in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, they are divided up into subrace that include Aquatic Elves, Gray Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves, and Drow. The Forgotten Realms campaign setting's elves (or Tel'Quessir as they call themselves) differ still, replacing the High Elves and Gray Elves with Moon or Silver Elves and Sun or Gold Elves, and adding Wild or Green Elves, Star or Mithral Elves and avariel (Winged Elves) to the Aquatic (Sea) Elves, Wood (Copper) Elves, Drow (Dark Elves), and Lythari (elves that transform into wolves).\\n\\nIn the Warhammer Fantasy game setting, the first civilized people of the world were the High Elves (Asur) from the Atlantis-like (though unsunken) island realm of Ulthuan. Early on, the High Elves colonize large parts of the Warhammer world, but following the rise of the Druchii (called Dark Elves by others than themselves), a fascist movement of corsairs and slavers, the High Elves were plunged into civil war and their power greatly faded. Most of the elves who decided to stay in the colonies took up residence in the deep forests of the Old World, and with time became known as Wood Elves (Asrai). The three kindreds of elves in Warhammer are not separate species but rather separate national groups which epitomise the moral and emotional extremes of the powerful elven psyche - The High Elves are elves at their most noble, morally upright and fair, the Dark elves are elves at their most cruel, vicious and debased. The Wood Elves combine aspects of both in their behaviour, seeming fickle, capricious and dangerously inconstant to outsiders. Unlike Tolkien's elves, those of the Warhammer world are not known to interbreed with humans - a consistent feature of their design in recent years being a concern to differentiate them as much as possible from humans, who they might otherwise begin to resemble too closely.\\n\\nWarhammer is also unique in the aspect that Warhammer 40,000, the science fantasy version of the game, features space faring elves under the name of Eldar (a term borrowed from Tolkien) -- an ancient race that once served the Old Ones and in the aftermath of a great catastrophe have split into four distinct groups, the Craftworld Eldar, the rustic Eldar Exodites (dinosaur riding eldar in self-imposed exile) the mysterious and acrobatic Harlequins and the fallen kindred, the Dark Eldar.\\n\\nThe universe of the Elder Scrolls computer games also features distinct races of elves (or \"Mer\" as they refer to themselves) including High Elves (Altmer), Dark Elves (Dunmer), Wood Elves (Bosmer), Wild Elves (Ayleid), ancestors of Dark Elves (Chimer), Snow elves (Falmer), Sea Elves (Maormer), Left-Handed Elves, ancestors of all elves (Aldmer). Interestingly, within the Elder Scrolls both the Dwarves (Dwemer) and the Orcs (Orsimer) are considered Elven or offshoots of the Elvish race. There are also Half-elves who look more like humans (Breton or manmer) .\\n\\nAzeroth, the fantasy world of the Warcraft computer game series originally featured elves similar to the Warhammer High or Wood Elves. The series introduces the naturalistic purple-skinned Night Elves, who were portrayed more favorably than traditional dark-skinned elves. These elves are the first race to appear in the world of Azeroth; other races of elves descend of them. Starting with Warcraft III, the High-Elves, outcast of the Night Elves, face the destruction of their kingdom, Quel'Thalas, and its capital, Silvermoon. The survivors are thereafter known as Blood Elves and, due to the destruction of the magically-powerful Sunwell, become magic addicts. Night Elves and Blood Elves are playable races in the World of Warcraft MMORPG.\\n\\nNevendaar, the world in the game Disciples II: Dark Prophecy and its expansions features a nation of elves called the Elven Alliance, consisting of the Noble Elves and the Wild Elves, both created by their god Gallean.\\n\\nDark Age of Camelot features elves as a playable race in the realm of Hibernia. These elves are supposedly based on the Celtic Sidhe, however bear a striking resemblance to the more human inspired elves of typical D&D fantasy lore.\\n\\nRuneScape has elves as a race in Gielinor. They dwell west in the hidden land of Isafdar, possibly inspired by Rivendell. Elves once ruled much of Kandarin under king Baxtorian, but with the onset of the God Wars, retreated west over the mountains, and their existence has passed out of common knowledge of most other races. Some elves mistrust humans, dwarves, and gnomes, and humans may not enter their capital city of Prifddinas. The elves worship Seren as their chief deity, who led them to Gielinor from another world during the First Age through the World Gate. They use crystal magic, not requiring the enchanted runestones of human mages, and are among the mightiest and oldest spellcasters of the land. One elf dwells below the Champion's Guild as the elven champion, while a battalion of elves play in a minigame as formidable wielders of magic. Along with these elves are \"Dark Elves\" of the Iorwerth clan who have taken over the elven capital of Prifddinas and turned against the elves to worship the evil god Zamorak. Members of the Iorwerth clan are also present in and under the plague-stricken city of West Ardougne in disguise as Mourners and plague workers. There are also some remaining rebel elves of the other clans, who are now forced to hide as they fight to take back power, and now reside in the secret town of Lletya, as well as other small camps and areas across Isafdar and Tiranwynn.\\n\\nThe elves of Glorantha (setting for the role-playing games RuneQuest and HeroQuest) share little with Tolkien's elves but their connection with forests and their preference of archery - they are mobile, humanoid plants.\\n\\nIn the roleplaying game The Burning Wheel Elves have a unique attribute, Grief. Grief is the result of living an endless life, while watching tragedy, death and destruction unfold. Elves who advance their Grief attribute past a certain point, wither away, or pass on to the West. Elves in Burning Wheel are otherwise much like their Tolkien counterparts.\\n\\nThe science fiction role-playing game Fading Suns features the fictional extraterrestrial races of the Ur-Obun and the Ur-Ukar, which are essentially science fiction renditions of elves and dark elves (somewhat akin to the Eldar and the Dark Eldar in the setting of Warhammer 40000 mentioned above).\\n\\nConversely, elves of the Tolkien mould have become standardized staple characters of modern fantasy to such an extent that breaking the norms for how an elf is supposed to be and behave has become an end in itself.\\n\\nCrow the elf is a role in the 1980 swords and sorcery film Hawk the Slayer, using \"rapid-fire/machine-gun-action\" archery skills.\\n\\nIn the 1986 fantasy film Legend, a young lad is aided in his quest to save a unicorn by a band of wood elves, most notably their leader, Honeythorn Gump. In the film, elves appear to age backwards, as observable by the elder Gump being younger in appearance than his fellows and by one of the elves remarking, \"I'm not as old as I used to be!\" while picking himself up after a tumble.\\n\\n"}

The system is powered by a  pump, with a four-bladed impeller and can produce a maximum water velocity of . The test area has a cross sectional area of  allowing model propellers of up to  in diameter to be tested. The pressure range of the tunnel can vary from a minimum of 7.6kN/m to a maximum of 106kN/m. Cavitation numbers of 0.5 (minimum) to 23 (maximum) can be accommodated for. Measurements can be taken using a 3 Watt, water-cooled, Argon-ion laser, a hydrophone, and two dynamometer.

The tunnel arrived at the University in 1947 and over the following few years the tunnel was heavily modified. The tunnel - which was originally designed to operated in the horizontal plane - was converted into a vertical loop tunnel and the length was reduced by half. The original observation window was modified and two more added. Because of damage, a new impeller was constructed and numerous pieces of measuring equipment were added. This equipment included pitot tube, a tachometer, stroboscopic lighting equipment, contact meters and a vacuum pump.

{"title": "Emigrant Trail in Wyoming", "body": "The path followed by the Oregon Trail, California Trail and Mormon Trail (collectively referred to as the Emigrant Trail) spans  through the U.S. state of Wyoming. The trail enters from Nebraska on the eastern border of the state near the present day town of Torrington and exited on the western border near the towns of Cokeville and Afton. An estimated 350,000 to 400,000 settlers traveled on the trail through Wyoming between 1841 and 1868. All three trails follow the same path through most of the state. The Mormon Trail splits at Fort Bridger and enters Utah, while the Oregon and California Trails continue to Idaho.\\n\\nthumbIn the eastern plains, the Emigrant Trail follows the North Platte River into Wyoming. The trail follows the river upstream to Fort Laramie, a prominent military and trading post in the region. Prior to 1850 the northern side of the river was thought to be impassable beyond Fort Laramie, so the wagon trains that were traveling on the northern side of the river through Nebraska had to undertake a dangerous crossing at the fort. After crossing, trains on the main trail to the south of the river had to cross the North Platte again  upstream. In 1850 several wagon trains successfully blazed a path along the northern side of the river. This new route, which reduced the risk and expense of crossing the river twice, was preferred for all subsequent traffic on the northern side of the river. The northern route is sometimes called Child's Route after Andrew Child who describe it in a guide book published in 1852. Above Fort Laramie, Child's Route follows the North Platte River through the present day town of Douglas, and near the site of Fort Fetterman which was built in 1867. This is the point at which the Bozeman Trail turned north to the gold fields of Montana in the 1860s. \\n\\nThe southern route also follows the river along the edge of the Laramie Mountains to an area near the current towns of Casper and Glenrock. In 1847, during the first Mormon emigration, Brigham Young established a ferry near present day Casper known as Mormon Ferry. The next year the ferry was moved a few miles downriver. The ferry was free for Latter Day Saints, but charged a toll for other users. The ferry was manned by groups of Mormons every summer from 1848 until 1852. In 1853 John Baptiste Richard built a toll bridge near the ferry site, which would eventually put all ferries on the North Platte out of business. In 1859, Louis Guinard built the Platte Bridge near the site of the original Mormon Ferry. Guinard also built a trading post at one end of the bridge which eventually became Fort Caspar.\\n\\nFamous landmarks along the southern route included Ayres Natural Bridge and Register Cliff, one of a number of locations along the trail in Wyoming where settlers carved their names.\\n\\nthumb upstream from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several miles along the river to Red Buttes, where a bend in the river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes. \\n\\nthumb arrival in the Sweetwater valley, the trail encounters one of the most important landmarks on the trail, Independence Rock. Independence Rock was named because settlers tried to reach it by July 4 (Independence Day in the United States) in order to help ensure that they will be at their destinations in California or Oregon before the winter snows come. Many of the travelers left their names on the rock, either carved or painted on with axle grease. It is estimated that more than 50,000 signatures were inscribed on Independence Rock. Other notable landmarks along the Sweetwater valley include Split Rock, Devil's Gate and Martin's Cove, where, in November 1856, the Martin Handcart Company were stranded by heavy snow until a rescue party from Salt Lake City arrived.\\n\\nThe trail continues west along the Sweetwater River eventually crossing the meandering river nine times, including three times within a  section through a narrow canyon in the Rattlesnake Hills. Prior to the 6th crossing, the trail crossed an unusual location known as Ice Slough. A covering of peat like vegetation grew over a small stream. The stream froze in winter and didn't thaw until early summer due to the insulating layer of vegetation. The ice was a welcome treat for settlers who were enduring temperatures over  in July. The trail crosses the Sweetwater three more times and encounters a large hill known as Rocky Ridge on the northern side of the river. This barren and rocky section of the lasted almost , and was considered a major obstacle in the trail. The same storm in November 1856 that debilitated the Martin Handcart Company also stranded the Willie Handcart Company on the eastern side of the ridge. Before rescuers could arrive, 21 people died in freezing temperatures. Following Rocky Ridge, the trail descends one more time into the Sweetwater valley to the ninth and final crossing of the Sweetwater at Burnt Ranch.\\n\\nIn 1853, a new route named Seminoe cutoff was established on the southern side of the river. It was named after trapper Basil LaJeunesse who was referred to as Seminoe by the Shoshone Indians. The Seminoe cutoff split from the main trail at the 6th crossing and rejoined it at Burnt Ranch, bypassing both Rocky Ridge and four of the river crossings, which was an advantage in the early spring and summer during high runoff. The route was used extensively in the 1850s, especially by the Mormon companies.\\n\\nthumb after crossing the Sweetwater at Burnt Ranch the trail crosses the continental divide at South Pass, unarguably the most important landmark on the entire trail. South Pass itself is an unimpressive open saddle between the Wind River Range to the north and the Antelope Hills to the south, but it represented a major milestone in the trip. In 1848, Congress created the Oregon Territory which included all the territory in Wyoming west of the Continental Divide. Crossing South Pass meant that the settlers had truly arrived in the Oregon Territory, though their ultimate destination was still a great distance away. Nearby Pacific Springs offered the first water since the trail had left the Sweetwater River and marked the beginning of a relatively dry stretch of trail until the settlers reached the Green River more than  away.\\n\\nLeaving Pacific Springs, the trail moves southwest alongside Pacific Creek for a short distance until it swoops to the west to intersect Dry Sandy creek, a small stream that is a tributary of the Little Sandy River which in turn flows into the Big Sandy River. True to its name, the water level on the Dry Sandy varied depending on the time of year and was often dry. South of the Dry Sandy ford, the trail split into two major sections, the main route which continues south to Fort Bridger, and the Sublette cutoff, which proceeds west directly to the Green River and Bear River valleys, bypassing Fort Bridger. The point at which the trails diverge is known as Parting of the Ways.  south the main trail fords the Little Sandy. Here, a secondary path to the Sublette cutoff leads from the Litty Sandy Pony Express station that was based here during the emigration period. The main trail goes on to ford the Big Sandy near the present day town of Farson. The trail proceeds along the northern side of the Big Sandy to its confluence with the Green River. Fording the Green River was very risky, so most travelers used one of a number of ferries operating on the Green River, including the Lombard Ferry and the Robinson Ferry.\\n\\nthumb toward Fort Bridger from the Green River, the main trail crosses Hams Fork near Granger and followed Blacks Fork to Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger and his partner Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette cutoff was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is the point at which the Mormon Trail splits from the Oregon Trail and California Trail for good. The Mormon Trail continues southwest, fording the Bear River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails turn and proceed northwest, crossing the Bear River Divide and into the Bear River valley on the western side of the state. The trail meets the Sublette cutoff near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow the Bear River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.\\n\\nThe Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff was opened in 1844 by the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party lead by mountaineers Caleb Greenwood and Isaac Hitchcock. Hitchcock, an old mountain man and trapper and one of the first of his kind to have been in California in 1832 }} Page 106, \"Old Greenwood\", 1968 Revised Edition, by Charles Kelley and Dale Morgan}} and from there cross the ridge into the Bear River Valley, completely bypassing Fort Bridger and the crossing of Bear River Ridge. The route shaved about  and 7 days off the main route, but the decision to cross nearly 45 waterless miles before reaching the Green River was not one to be taken lightly. Settlers had to decide between time and the health of their livestock. A traveler in 1846 wrote:  The route reached the height of popularity during the California Gold Rush of the 1850s when a desire to speed to the California gold fields outweighed the risks. The route was named the Sublette cutoff by Joseph Ware in his popular 1849 guide book to the trail after an individual named Solomon Sublette who told him about the route, and not William Sublette as is popular myth. The popularity of the guide book during the 1850s cemented the name, though most scholars today call it the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff after its original discoverer.\\n\\nAs on the main route, several ferries operated where the cutoff crossed the Green River near the present day town of La Barge. Early settlers crossed the Names Hill Ford, which was barely passable when the water was low. Later The Names Hill Ferry offered a safer alternative. The nearby Mormon Ferry was located a mile upstream, and the Mountain Man Ferry operated during the Gold Rush days. West of the ford is its namesake, Names Hill, which is a prominent emigrant \"recording area\" with signatures and other carvings. One notable signature is James Bridger,1844,Trapper. It is unclear if the signature is authentic, since Bridger was known to be illiterate. The hill also features native American pictographs.\\n\\nA secondary cutoff named the Slate Creek or Kinney Cutoff breaks from the main trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette cutoff on Slate Creek Ridge. This route was slightly longer then the Sublette, but had the advantage of only 10 waterless miles rather than the 45 endured on the Sublette trail.\\n\\nright 1857 increased traffic along the Emigrant Trail encouraged the federal government to investigate ways to improve the road to the western states. Expeditions under the command of Frederick W. Lander surveyed a new route starting at Burnt Ranch following the last crossing of the Sweetwater River. The new road splits from the main trail and follows the Sweetwater further upstream toward its source. The trail eventually crosses the continental divide north of South Pass and proceeds through sparsely-forested high altitude region at the southern edge of the Wind River Range. The route fords the Green River near Big Piney, Wyoming and then transverses the Wyoming Range, Grey's River, and Salt River Range before descending into the Salt River valley, eventually leaving the state near Afton. In Idaho, the road proceeded due west until it met the main trail before arriving at Fort Hall. \\n\\nBy crossing the lush Wyoming and Salt River Ranges instead of circling via the deserts to the south, the route provided ample wood, grass and water for the travelers, and cut nearly 7 days off the total travel time for wagon trails. Despite the better conditions for livestock, the mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather still proved to be dangerous for travelers. Funds were appropriated in 1858 and 115 men completed the road in 90 days, clearing timber and moving  of earth. The road, which was the first government road project in the west, opened in 1859 and remained in use until 1912, when automobiles made it obsolete.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emil Leon Post", "body": "Emil Leon Post (February 11, 1897, Augustów – April 21, 1954, New York City) was a mathematician and logician. He is best known for his work in the field that eventually became known as computability theory.\\n\\nPost was born into a Polish-Jewish family that immigrated to America when he was a child. After completing his Ph.D. in mathematics at Columbia University, he did a post-doctorate at Princeton University. While at Princeton, he came very close to discovering the incompleteness of Principia Mathematica, which Kurt Gödel proved in 1931. Post then became a high school mathematics teacher in New York City. In 1936, he was appointed to the mathematics department at the City College of New York, where he remained until his death, in 1954, from a heart attack at the age of 57.\\n\\nIn his doctoral thesis, Post proved, among other things, that the propositional calculus of Principia Mathematica was complete: all tautologies are theorem, given the Principia axioms and the rules of substitution and modus ponens. Post also devised truth tables independently of Wittgenstein and C.S. Peirce and put them to good mathematical use. Jean Van Heijenoort's well-known source book on mathematical logic (1966) reprinted Post's classic article setting out these results.\\n\\nIn 1936, Post developed, independently of Alan Turing, a mathematical model of computation that was essentially equivalent to the Turing machine model. Intending this as the first of a series of models of equivalent power but increasing complexity, he titled his paper Formulation 1. This model is sometimes called \"Post's machine\" or a Post-Turing machine, but is not to be confused with Post's tag machines or other special kinds of Post canonical system, a computational model using string rewriting and developed by Post in the 1920s but first published in 1943. Post's rewrite technique is now ubiquitous in programming language specification and design, and so with Church's lambda-calculus is a salient influence of classical modern logic on practical computing. Post devised a method of 'auxilary symbols' by which he could canonically represent any Post-generative language, and indeed any computable function or set at all. This method is very old, being first understood by ancient Indian grammarians, especially the tradition associated with Panini and his grammar. Sanskritists now accept that Panini's linguistic apparatus is well-described as an \"applied\" Post system. Considerable evidence shows ancient mastery of context-sensitive grammars, and a general ability to solve many complex generative problems. Frits Staal has written than \"Panini is the Indian Euclid.\" Emil Post is Panini's modern counterpart, showing the relationship between a computationally typical natural language grammar and universal computation. \\n\\nThe unsolvability of his Post correspondence problem turned out to be exactly what was needed to obtain unsolvability results in the theory of formal languages.\\n\\nIn an influential address to the American Mathematical Society in 1944, he raised the question of the existence of an uncomputable recursively enumerable set whose Turing degree is less than that of the halting problem. This question, which became known as Post's Problem, stimulated much research. It was solved in the affirmative in the 1950s by the introduction of the powerful priority method in recursion theory.\\n\\nPost made a fundamental and still influential contribution to the theory of polyadic, or ''n''-ary, groups in a long paper published in 1940. His major theorem showed that a polyadic group is the iterated multiplication of elements of a normal subgroup of a group, such that the quotient group is cyclic of order n − 1. He also demonstrated that a polyadic group operation on a set can be expressed in terms of a group operation on the same set. The paper contains many other important results.\\n\\n"}

He was later the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway.\\n\\nStang finished his secondary education in 1900, and graduated as cand.jur. in 1905. He practised as a barrister in Kristiania from 1911. He joined the Norwegian Labour Party in 1911, and was elected vice chairman from 1918. He was a delegate to the Founding Congress of Comintern in Moscow in 1919. After the death of Kyrre Grepp he was acting leader of the Norwegian Labour Party, from 1922 to 1923. He participated in the formation of the Communist Party of Norway in 1923, where he became a member of the Central Committee. He left the Communist Party in 1928. He was a member of the Kristiania City Council from 1917 to 1928. He was a substitute to the Parliament of Norway from 1922 to 1924. He was also a member of a number of committees on law reforms. From 1928 Stang concentrated on his juridical career. He was appointed Supreme Court judge from 1937. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany he was arrested and held at the prison Møllergata 19 in Oslo and at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany. He was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway from 1946 to 1952.\\n\\nStang was born in Kristiania as the son of Prime Minister and chairman of the Conservative Party, Emil Stang, and his wife Adelaide Pauline Berg. He was married to Fredrikke Elise Nicoline Bøckman Otto from 1907 to 1920, and to Sigrid Friis from 1925. He was the grandson of Prime Minister Frederik Stang, and a brother of politician Fredrik Stang.\\n\\nEmil Stang was a central figure in the labor movement in the radical left wing and split the years around World War I, but he left politics for 1928 and then concentrated on his work as a lawyer and judge.\\n\\nStang was born into the most prominent conservative politician dynasty of his time and followed basically the drawn track for a man with his background. He took his final exams in 1900, was conscript officer in 1901 and in law. 1905. From 1906 he was clerk to his cousin, Supreme Court lawyer Fredrik Stang Lund, and 1911 he was licensed as a Supreme Court lawyer and started his own law practice in Christiania.\\n\\nIn the study period had come with rod in the circle of radical students around Kyrre Grepp. He joined the Social Democratic student organization and followed it up in the Labor 1911. He attended the party's national convention in 1915 and was elected to the council Kristiania 1916, where he was a member until 1928. 1922-24 he was deputy to the Parliament and met a number of times. He was involved particularly in social policy and social issues and was also involved in a number of committees to study law reform in this area, including people in the Government Pension Committee 1919-20.\\n\\nWhen the revolutionary \"new direction\" under Martin Tranmæl and Kyrre Grepp leadership seized the leadership of the Labor 1918, Emil Stang elected vice chairman in the party. By Grepp death in February 1922, he was the acting chairman until February 1923 congress, when Oscar Torp took over - a history professor Edvard Bull de as the new vice chairman. Leadership shift occurred after an internal party strife in the wake of Kyrre Grepp death, and in this struggle was Stang active in two ways: At first he tried to shift the sun and wind between the parties, chastise both sides and thereby strengthen his own candidacy ahead of the upcoming election the new party chairman. In turn, he joined However Scheflo-wing against Tranmæl wing. At the party split in November 1923 followed the rail, making the minority out of the Labour Party, was co-founded Communist Party (NKP) and was elected to the Central Board for the new party.\\n\\nThe basis for Stang's line of choice here was probably first and foremost, his enthusiasm for the Russian Revolution and his hopes for the new Russian state, to Soviet rule. Party conflict was in the final phase is defined as a struggle for the Labour Party's relationship with the communist, 3rd International, the Comintern. Scheflo-wing positioning itself as the most Comintern faith, and this was apparently crucial for Stang's line selection. Stang had herself been present in Moscow at the founding of the Comintern in 1919, and his preoccupation with developments in Russia was reflected in several political works - Soviet Russia, transition to socialism and the Soviet Constitution. A possible supplementary part of the explanation for Stang's line selection process during the split in the Labor Party is that he, despite his years in the party leadership did not develop any significant degree of familiarity with the smooth organization of the work or the party's mainstream.\\n\\nEmil Stang remained in CPN also when many of his comrades joined the collection of the Norwegian Labour Party and Social Democratic Labour Party 1927. In connection with the struggle of the Communist Party of Hornsrud government formation, however, he had enough and resigned from the Communist Party in 1928.\\n\\nIn his legal practice, provided the rod reputation as a brilliant barrister. There was such through the defense of the Evening Post's editor in a famous libel suit (Aarrestad case) and in defense of Kyrre Grepp (1921) in connection with an indictment for illegal distribution of socialist literature from the Russian Bolshevik regime to the socialists in Europe. It was not the least Emil Stang's profits that the Supreme Court eventually acquitted Grepp on the grounds that the Conservative government's decree that led to the indictment, was illegal. Stang's reputation was solidified when he was in the 1930s, defended and got acquitted Arnulf Øverland for blasphemy charges after his lecture \"Christianity - the tenth plague.\" Also as a public defender Rod achieved universal recognition.\\tWhile he worked as a lawyer, wrote Rod a number of legal and political articles and papers, including Folkeretslig politics, working class municipal policy or procedure in criminal cases (which appeared in several editions) and the Norwegian building law.\\n\\n1936, Stang extraordinary judge of the Supreme Court, and 1937 he was appointed High Court judge - paradoxically, perhaps because of that as the Member of Parliament in 1920 had been on a campaign from the Liberal and Labor in order to reduce the Supreme Court's influence by repealing trial court, from a pure class political justification. From 1940 he was a member of the Labour Court and served as its chairman from 1946 to 1955.\\n\\nStang was for various reasons little involved in the dramatic events of the Supreme Court 1940. He was not among the acting judges, and therefore not present in Oslo in April 1940, when the Supreme Court appointed the Administrative Council. He was in place when the State Council negotiations began in June and joined the majority opinions and recommendations when it came to the German demands. But when the Supreme Court in the fall came in conflict with the Ministry of Justice and Acting Minister Riisnæs, he was again absent. On 30 November he was arrested by the German security police during the investigation of \"internal political enemy of the state estimate and intelligence matters\" from the communist and former communist side. The arrest provoked unrest among his colleagues in the court and contributed to the Supreme Court judges, 12 December Downloaded's office for the remainder of the occupation period. Rod himself was deposed by Riisnæs in January 1941 and was imprisoned until the beginning of May. Then he was jailed again in January 1944, set four months Møllergaten 19 and then a year in Sachsenhausen and Neuengamme. He survived so far.\\n\\n"}

He is one of the several top chess grandmasters who were born in Baku, Azerbaijan (e.g., Garry Kasparov, Teimour Radjabov, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Vladimir Akopian). \\n\\nSutovsky learned to play chess at the age of four. He achieved notable successes by winning the World Junior Chess Championship in Medellín in 1996, finishing first at the double-round-robin VAM Hoogeveen Tournament in 1997 (ahead of Judit Polgár, Loek van Wely, and Vasily Smyslov), and winning Hastings 2000 (ahead of Alexey Dreev, Ivan Sokolov and Jonathan Speelman). IM Ilya Tsesarsky was Emil's trainer for a couple of years. Later Sutovsky was trained by GM Lev Psakhis, and starting 1996 Sutovsky works with GM Alon Greenfeld. In 2001 Sutovsky recorded perhaps the greatest individual result by an Israeli player: seeded only 35th among the 204 participants (including 143 Grandmasters) in the second European Chess Championship in Ohrid, Macedonia, he started with an ordinary 3.5-2.5. He then started a series of resounding victories (e.g. ), and finished the tournament with 9.5-3.5, along with future FIDE world champion Ruslan Ponomariov, and ahead of Judit Polgár, Nigel Short, and many other world-class players .He went on to beat Ponomariov 1.5-0.5 in a rapid chess tie-break, and was crowned European Champion. \\n\\nIn 2003 he tied for first with Alexander Beliavsky in the Vidmar Memorial. In 2007, he placed second at the 8th European Chess Championship, held in Dresden, following a play-off with the eventual winner GM Vladislav Tkachiev and GMs Dmitry Jakovenko and Ivan Cheparinov. \\n\\nHe finished tied for first in two major open tournaments in 2005: in Gibraltar he scored 7.5-2.5 (the same score as Levon Aronian, Zahar Efimenko, Kiril Georgiev, and Alexei Shirov), and at the Aeroflot Open in Moscow he scored 6.5-2.5 (the same as Vasily Ivanchuk, Alexander Motylev, Andrei Kharlov, and Vladimir Akopian). His superior tie-break in the latter gave him first place (ahead of such a stars like Aronian,Radjabov,Mamedyarov,Ponomariov,Karjakin etc...) and with it an invitation to the prestigious Dortmund tournament later in the year, in which he beat classical world champion Vladimir Kramnik , scoring 3.5-5.5.\\n\\nSutovsky played in three FIDE Knock-out World Championships: in 1997 he was eliminated in the first round by Guildardo Garcia; in 2000 he was eliminated in the first round by Igor Nataf; in 2001 he was eliminated in round three by eventual runner-up Vasily Ivanchuk. \\n\\nHe did not participate in the controversial 2004 championship because of concerns about how its hosts, Libya, would treat Israeli players.\\n\\nHe took part in FIDE World Cup 2005, successfully passed first two rounds, but was eliminated in round three by Étienne Bacrot in rapid tie-break.\\n\\nIn 2007, Sutovsky, known for his vast theoretical knowledge and analytical skills became a second of US Grandmaster Gata Kamsky, helping him to win the FIDE World Cup 2007.\\n\\nIn September 2009 Sutovsky won Inventi Chess Tournament in Antwerp.\\n\\nSutovsky represented Israel in seven Chess Olympiads from 1996 to 2010. In the 2010 Chess Olympiad he took gold medal for the best individual performance on board two and showed the highest TPR (2895) among all the participants of the Olympiad.\\n\\nHis uncompromising style means his tournament results can be somewhat inconsistent: shortly before his successes in Gibraltar and Moscow, he had performed disappointingly in 2004 at round-robin events at Pamplona (3-4), Pune (3.5-5.5) and Ashdod (1.5-3.5). Sutovsky, who won a total of nearly 40 International Grandmaster Tournaments (more than most of the top ten players) is arguably the most volatile player among top Grandmasters. \\n\\nSutovsky's uncompromising style has also resulted in a number of highly spectacular games: his sacrificial victory over Ilya Smirin in the 2002 Israeli Championship was voted the best game of issue 86 of Chess Informant , and his victory over Danny Gormally at Gibraltar 2005 earned him the prize for best game . This game was highly praised by FIDE World Champion Vishwanathan Anand, who picked this game as the best chess game he had ever seen. Sutovsky is considered to be one of the most creative chessplayers,since 2006 he has his own column - \"Jeu créateur\" (\"Creative chess\") in major French chess magazine Europe Échecs.\\n\\nSutovsky virtually always plays 1.e4 with White, occasionally testing unfashionable or old-fashioned openings such as the Two Knights Defence, the King's Gambit, and the Scotch Game. With Black, he usually plays the Grünfeld Defence or King's Indian Defence against 1.d4, and Sicilian Defence or Ruy Lopez against 1.e4.\\n\\nHis romantic chess style might be linked to his hobby – Sutovsky is a profound bass-baritone singer . Sutovsky is an avid Trivia player, he is a founder and captain of chess team, which participates in What? Where? When? tournaments.Sutovsky speaks five languages, and is widely acclaimed as one of the most intelligent personalities in the chess world. \\n\\nOn the November 2010 FIDE list, Sutovsky has an Elo rating of 2695 (his peak was 2697 - 17th place in the world at the time), making him Israel's number 2 (behind Boris Gelfand), and number 42 in the world.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emmen, Netherlands", "body": "Emmen, church: Grote of PancratiuskerkEmmen (: em n) is a municipality and a town in the northeastern Netherlands.\\n\\nA prime example of a planned city, Emmen arose from several small farming and peat-harvesting communities which have dotted the province of Drenthe since the Middle Ages. Traces of these communities can still be seen in the form of the villages of Westenesch, Noordbarge and Zuidbarge: they have a separate history and layout, but are surrounded by the suburbs and the centre of Emmen.\\n\\nThe expansion of the town did not happen until after the Second World War. Suburbs were built in a clockwise direction around the old centre of Emmen, starting with Emmermeer directly to the north, and followed by Angelslo (for which an old village of the same name was demolished), Emmerhout (famed at the time for being built in the forest, quite separate from the town), Bargeres, the Rietlanden and Parc Sandur. Construction of the last suburb, called Delftlanden, is already well underway with a large number of homes already built and people living in the area.\\n\\nThere are few historic landmarks left within the town, but those few include the church on the market square, where a church has been standing since the Middle Ages, the court of law building, dating from the beginning of the twentieth century and the post office from the same time. In the town's environs an earthwork by Robert Smithson, \"Broken Circle/Spiral Hill,\" may be found.\\n\\nPrime economic booster since the 1980s is the zoo, the Dierenpark Emmen. Begun in the 1930s, it was almost completely redesigned in the 1970s, and is now co-owned by the municipality of Emmen. It attracts over 1.5 million visitors per year. Important industries include Teijin Aramid, DSM Engineering Plastics, Wellman and Diolen Industrial Fibers. There are extensive glasshouse complexes for horticulture, especially in the Klazienaveen-Erica area. The governmental Topographical Department of the Netherlands is located in Emmen. The municipality offers some 38,000 jobs.\\n\\nEmmen is the second most populous urban area of Drenthe. The municipality of Emmen is one of the largest in area in the Netherlands, although the area outside the town borders of Emmen is rather rural. The only villages of importance are Emmer-Compascuum, Klazienaveen, Nieuw-Amsterdam and Schoonebeek.\\n\\nThe municipality of Emmen has some 104,000 inhabitants, with 56,000 living in the town Emmen. Compared to some 3,000 inhabitants in the nineteenth century, this illustrates the rapid growth of Emmen in the past 150 years.\\n\\nEmmen is served by one train connection with Zwolle, which in turn leads to the rest of the country.\\n\\nIn addition, there are regular and frequent bus lines with Groningen, Hoogeveen and Assen, as well as the surrounding countryside, and Meppen in Germany, departing from Emmen's two bus terminals.By car, the town is accessible via the N34 from Zwolle to Groningen, the N381 to Drachten, the N391 to Veendam and the A37 from Hoogeveen to Meppen in Germany.The nearest airport is Groningen Airport Eelde at a distance of 50 kilometers.Furthermore, there are inland shipping connections via Nieuw-Amsterdam to Coevorden, Hoogeveen and Almelo.\\n\\nBarger-Compascuum, Emmen, Emmer-Compascuum, Erica, Hesselterbrink (), Klazienaveen, Nieuw-Amsterdam, Nieuw-Dordrecht, Nieuw-Schoonebeek, Nieuw-Weerdinge, Roswinkel, Schoonebeek, Veenoord, Weiteveen, Zwartemeer\\n\\nThe town's football club FC Emmen plays their home games in Univé Stadion.

{"title": "Emperor Hui of Han", "body": "Emperor Hui of Han (210 BC – 188 BC) was the second emperor of the Han Dynasty in China. He was the second son of the first Han emperor, Han Gaozu and Empress Dowager Lü. He is generally remembered as a weak character dominated by his mother, Empress Dowager Lü, who was personally kind and generous but unable to escape the impact of her viciousness. He tried to protect Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zhao, his younger half-brother, from being murdered by Empress Dowager Lü, but failed. After that he indulged himself in drinking and women and died at a relatively young age. Empress Dowager Lü installed two of his sons, Liu Gong and Liu Hong (known collectively as Emperors Shao of Han), the sons of Emperor's concubine(s) after he died without a designated heir. Emperor Hui's wife was Empress Zhang Yan, a niece of his by his sister Princess Luyuan; their marriage was the result of insistence by Empress Dowager Lü and was a childless one.\\n\\nLiu Ying's childhood is not completely clear. What is known is that he was not his father Liu Bang's oldest son—that would be Liu Fei, who would later be created the Prince of Qi. However, Liu Ying was considered to be the proper heir because his mother, the later Empress Lü, was Liu Bang's wife, while Liu Fei's mother was either a concubine or a mistress.\\n\\nWhat is also known is that during Chu Han Contention, when Liu Bang fought a five-year war with Xiang Yu for supremacy over the Chinese world, his mother, his sister, and he did not initially follow his father to the Principality of Han (modern Sichuan, Chongqing, and southern Shaanxi); rather, they stayed in his father's home territory, perhaps in his home town of Pei (沛縣, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) deep in Xiang's Principality of Western Chu, presumably with his grandfather Liu Zhijia.\\n\\nIn 205 BC, Liu Bang appeared to be near total victory, having captured Xiang's capital of Pengcheng. How his family received this news was unclear, but a few months later, when Xiang responded and crushed Liu's forces, Liu fled and, in his flight, attempted to pass through his home town to take his family with him. He was able to find his children and carry them along with him, but his father and wife were captured by Xiang's forces and kept as hostages—and would not be returned to him until Liu and Xiang temporarily made peace in 203 BC. The then-very young Liu Ying must have then spent these days not knowing what the eventual fate of his grandfather and mother would be.\\n\\nAfter Liu Bang's victory and self-declaration as the emperor (later known as Emperor Gao), thus establishing the Han Dynasty, in 202 BC, he created his wife empress and Liu Ying, as his proper heir, crown prince. As crown prince, Prince Ying was considered to be kind and tolerant, characteristics that Emperor Gao did not like. Rather, he favored his young son Liu Ruyi, whom he considered to be more like him and whose mother, Consort Qi, was his favorite concubine. With the support of the officials, however, Prince Ying's status as heir survived despite Consort Qi's machinations.\\n\\nAs crown prince, Prince Ying, along with his mother, would be the ones who would rule on important matters at the capital in his father's absence during various campaigns. When Ying Bu rebelled in 196 BC, Emperor Gao was ill and considered sending Prince Ying as the commander of the forces against Ying Bu rather than campaigning himself, but at the suggestion of Empress Lü (who averred that the generals, who were generally Emperor Gao's old friends, might not fully obey the young prince), went on the campaign himself. Prince Ying was instead put in charge of home territories around the capital Chang'an, assisted by Confucian scholar Shusun Tong (叔孫通) and strategist Zhang Liang (張良). He appeared to carry out the tasks competently but without distinction.\\n\\nPrince Ying succeeded to the throne of Han when his father died in 195 BC from complications of an arrow wound suffered during the campaign against Ying Bu.\\n\\nImmediately upon Prince Ying's ascension to the throne as Emperor Hui, Empress Lü, now empress dowager, became the effective lead figure in his administration. She wanted to carry out a plot of revenge against Consort Qi and her son Ruyi. She first arrested Consort Qi and put her in prison garb (shaved head, confined by stock, and wearing red clothes). She then summoned Liu Ruyi to the capital—an attempt that was initially resisted by Ruyi's chief of staff Zhou Chang (周昌), whom she respected because he was one of the officials who insisted on Liu Ying being the rightful heir. Instead of directly moving against Zhou and Liu Ruyi, though, Lü circumvented Zhou by first summoning him to the capital, and then summoning Liu Ruyi.\\n\\nEmperor Hui tried to save Liu Ruyi's life. Before Liu Ruyi could get to the capital, Emperor Hui intercepted his young brother at Bashang (霸上, in modern Xi'an) and received Liu Ruyi into his palace, and they dined together and slept together. Empress Dowager Lü wanted to kill Liu Ruyi, but was afraid that any attempt might also harm her own son, and therefore could not carry out her plot for several months.\\n\\nEmpress Dowager Lü got her chance in winter 195 BC. One morning, Emperor Hui was out hunting and wanted to take Liu Ruyi with him. The young prince was then only 12 years old and refused to get up from bed, and Emperor Hui left for the hunt on his own. Empress Dowager Lü heard this and immediately sent an assassin into the emperor's palace to force poisoned wine down the prince's throat. By the time that Emperor Hui returned, his brother was dead. She then tortured Consort Qi inhumanely, and Consort Qi would die from the torture. When Emperor Hui saw Consort Qi in her tortured state, he cried out loud and became ill for about a year, complaining to his mother that he felt that he could no longer govern the empire, given that he, as the emperor, could not even protect the concubine and son so loved by his father. (Consort Qi had her eyes dug out, and her arms and legs cut off. The remaining head and torso were fed and kept alive in a pig's bin. This is the state in which Emperor Hui saw of his father's favorite, and the mother of his beloved little brother.) From that point on, Emperor Hui indulged himself with wine and women and no longer made key governing decisions, leaving them to his mother.\\n\\nEmperor Hui, however, continued to try to protect his siblings. In winter of 194 BC, when Liu Fei, Prince of Qi—his older brother—made an official visit to the capital, they both attended a feast put on by Empress Dowager Lü. Emperor Hui, honoring the prince as an older brother, asked him to sit in a seat at the table even more honored than his own. The empress dowager was greatly offended and instructed her servants to pour a cup of poisoned wine for Liu Fei and then toasted him. As Liu Fei was about to drink the poisoned wine, however, Emperor Hui, realizing what was happening, grabbed the cup as if to drink it himself. Empress Dowager Lü jumped up and slapped at the cup, spilling it. Liu Fei was able to get out of the situation by offering an entire commandery from his principality to Princess Luyuan as her realm. Empress Dowager Lü, who greatly loved her daughter as well, became pleased and let Liu Fei return to his principality.\\n\\nEmperor Hui died in the autumn of 188 BC of an unspecified illness.\\n\\nIn winter 192 BC, Emperor Hui married Empress Zhang, a marriage that would not yield any children. However, whether Emperor Hui actually had children during or before his reign is a controversial question. The officials, including Chen Ping (陳平) and Zhou Bo (周勃), who would later overthrow the Lü clan after the deaths of both Emperor Hui and Empress Dowager Lü, claimed that Emperor Hui had no sons—but that Empress Zhang, at Empress Dowager Lü's instigation, stole eight boys from other people, put their mothers to death, and made the children her own. Modern historians have split opinions on the issue, but largely believe that the boys were actually Emperor Hui's sons by concubines and that Empress Zhang did indeed put their mothers to death and make them her own children. (As, for example, Bo Yang pointed out, it would be logically incongruent, if Empress Zhang did steal these children from elsewhere, for her to put only the mothers but not the fathers to death.) Under this theory, the officials denied the imperial ancestry of these children in fear of the fact that they were also descendants of Empress Dowager Lü and her clan, and therefore might avenge the slaughter of the Lü clan—a reason that they themselves admitted. Except for Liu Gong (who was deposed and executed by Empress Dowager Lü), the other children either died young by natural causes or were executed by the officials after they made Liu Heng, the Prince of Dai (Emperor Wen) the emperor.\\n\\nOne can perhaps analogize these princes to the English \"Princes in the Tower\" -- innocent children who were the victim of dynastic infighting and their own bloodlines.\\n\\nEmperor Hui's most trusted companion was documented by Sima Qian, China's Grand Historian:\\n\\nHui was thus the second of ten rulers of the Han Dynasty to officially elevate a male lover to the top of the administration. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei", "body": "Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei ((北)魏孝莊帝) (507–531), personal name Yuan Ziyou (元子攸), was an emperor of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei. He was placed on the throne by the general Erzhu Rong, who refused to recognize the young emperor Yuan Zhao that Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu placed on the throne after she poisoned Emperor Xiaoming. During his reign, Erzhu largely controlled the military and acted in a violent manner, leading Emperor Xiaozhuang to believe that he would usurp the throne. In 530, Emperor Xiaozhuang ambushed Erzhu and killed him in the palace, but Erzhu's cousin Erzhu Shilong and nephew Erzhu Zhao subsequently defeated Emperor Xiaozhuang, capturing and killing him.\\n\\nYuan Ziyou was born in 507, during the reign of his cousin Emperor Xuanwu, as the third son of the highly regarded imperial prince, Emperor Xuanwu's uncle Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng. His mother was Yuan Xie's wife Princess Li, the daughter of the honored official Li Chong (李沖). Of his two older brothers, the oldest, Yuan Zizhi (元子直), was not Princess Li's son, and the other, born of Princess Li, was Yuan Shao (元劭).\\n\\nIn 508, Princess Li was again pregnant and due to give birth, when Emperor Xuanwu, believing in false accusations of his maternal uncle Gao Zhao that Yuan Xie was plotting rebellion, forced Yuan Xie to commit suicide. Princess Li soon gave birth to Yuan Ziyou's younger brother, Yuan Zizheng (元子正). It appeared that Yuan Ziyou was close to his brothers. Yuan Shao, as the oldest son of Yuan Xie's wife, inherited Yuan Xie's title of Prince of Pengcheng. Yuan Ziyou and his brothers Yuan Zizhi and Yuan Zizheng were created dukes—in Yuan Ziyou's case, the Duke of Wucheng. Yuan Ziyou, in his youth, served as an attendant to Emperor Xuanwu, and was praised for his intelligence and handsome looks. He held increasingly higher offices during the reigns of Emperor Xuanwu and his son and successor Emperor Xiaoming.\\n\\nIn 526, Emperor Xuanwu's son and successor Emperor Xiaoming promoted Yuan Ziyou to be the Prince of Changle. In 527, however, he lost all actual authority (although he retained honorific offices) when Yuan Shao was suspected of plotting a rebellion and was reported by Yuan Yanming (元延明) the Prince of Anfeng. Emperor Xiaoming and his mother, Empress Dowager Hu, however, did not kill either Yuan Ziyou or his brothers.\\n\\nIn 528, Emperor Xiaoming, who was having increasing friction with Empress Dowager Hu, conspired with the general Erzhu Rong to have Erzhu advance on the capital Luoyang to force Empress Dowager Hu to yield power and to kill her lover Zheng Yan (鄭儼) and Zheng's associate Xu Ge (徐紇). The conspiracy was discovered, and Empress Dowager Hu poisoned the emperor and made Yuan Zhao, a two-year-old son of an imperial prince, emperor. Erzhu refused to recognize Yuan Zhao as emperor and advanced on Luoyang. Because Yuan Xie's memory remained highly regarded by the people, and Yuan Ziyou was renowned for his abilities, Erzhu sent secret messengers to make overtures to him, offering to make him emperor. Yuan Ziyou agreed, and when Erzhu advanced to Luoyang's vicinity, Yuan Ziyou, along with Yuan Shao and Yuan Zizheng, fled Luoyang and joined Erzhu's army. Erzhu proclaimed him emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhuang), and there was much rejoicing in the army ranks.\\n\\nEmperor Xiaozhuang made Yuan Shao the Wushang Prince (無上王, meaning \"prince without anyone greater\") and Yuan Zizheng, who was Duke of Bacheng, the Prince of Shiping. He invested Erzhu Rong with a variety of supreme military and civilian titles, and created him the title Prince of Taiyuan.\\n\\nUpon hearing of Emperor Xiaozhuang's ascension, Empress Dowager Hu's generals Zheng Xianhu (鄭先護), a friend of Emperor Xiaozhuang, and Fei Mu (費穆), quickly surrendered, while another general, Li Shengui (李神軌), fled. Zheng Yan and Xu Ge also deserted Luoyang. Empress Dowager Hu became desperate; after ordering Emperor Xiaoming's consorts to all become Buddhist nuns, she took tonsure herself although she did not declare herself a nun. Erzhu ordered the imperial officials to welcome Emperor Xiaozhuang into Luoyang, while sending cavalry to arrest Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao. After a meeting with Empress Dowager Hu, in which she tried to defend her actions but drew no sympathy from Erzhu, Erzhu had her and Yuan Zhao thrown into the Yellow River to drown.\\n\\nEmpress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao would not be Erzhu's only victims, however. Fei suggested to Erzhu that since his army was actually small, as soon as the imperial officials realized the situation, they would resist him. He suggested that Erzhu carry out a massacre of the imperial officials, and Erzhu, despite the opposition of his strategist Murong Shaozong (慕容紹宗), proceeded. Erzhu ordered the imperial officials to his camp at Heyin (河陰, near Luoyang) under the pretense that Emperor Xiaozhuang was going to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth there, and then surrounded the imperial officials and slaughtered them, killing more than 2,000 of them, including Emperor Xiaozhuang's uncle, the prime minister Yuan Yong the Prince of Gaoyang. Erzhu also sent soldiers to assassinate Yuan Shao and Yuan Zizheng, while putting Emperor Xiaozhuang under effective arrest in the army camp.\\n\\nEmperor Xiaozhuang, in fear and anger, sent a messenger to Erzhu, suggesting that he would be willing to yield the throne either to Erzhu or to another person that Erzhu designated. Erzhu, under suggestion of his general Gao Huan, toyed with the idea of taking the throne himself or offering it to his close associate Yuan Tianmu (元天穆), a distant relative of Emperor Xiaozhuang. Subsequently, however, his sorcerer Liu Lingzhu (劉靈助) predicted that neither Erzhu himself nor Yuan Tianmu was favored to be an emperor by the gods, and that only Emperor Xiaozhuang was favored. Erzhu therefore stopped these plans and offered a deep apology to Emperor Xiaozhuang, claiming that the massacre was a result of the soldiers going out of control. However, the people of Luoyang and the surviving imperial officials, fearful of further massacre, fled Luoyang, which was then left nearly empty, particularly because Erzhu publicly pondered the idea of moving the capital to Jinyang (晉陽, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). It was not until Erzhu offered offices to the heirs of the officials who died and publicly renounced the idea of moving the capital that the people began to return to Luoyang.\\n\\nNevertheless, Erzhu, while publicly returning authority to Emperor Xiaozhuang, retained command of the armed forces, while putting several officials closely aligned with him, including Yuan Tianmu and his cousin Erzhu Shilong, into high positions. He kept a close watch on Emperor Xiaozhuang even though he was largely away from the capital. He also wanted Emperor Xiaozhuang to marry his daughter Erzhu Ying'e, who had previously been Emperor Xiaoming's concubine, as his empress. Because this match constituted incest under Confucian traditions, Emperor Xiaozhuang hesitated, but under the suggestion of the official Zu Ying (祖瑩), who advised that this marriage would be advantageous, Emperor Xiaozhuang agreed.\\n\\nEmperor Xiaozhuang was said to be diligent in governmental matters, and even though Erzhu was not particularly pleased with the development, Emperor Xiaozhuang proceeded to take much interest in criminal matters, as well as refusing to comply with all of Erzhu's recommendations for officials. He did not dare to directly cross Erzhu, however, and Erzhu continued to install officials close to him in the imperial administration.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Erzhu proceeded to try to reunify the empire, which had been largely divided by agrarian rebellions that rose during the reign of Emperor Xiaoming. At that time, the more major rebels included:\\n\\nErzhu's first target was Ge, who had put the important city Yecheng under siege and was getting close to the Yellow River. With just 7,000 cavalry soldiers, Erzhu caught the much larger Ge army by surprise and crushed it, capturing Ge and delivering him to Luoyang, where Ge was executed in winter 528. Ge's general Han Lou (韓樓) took party of his army and took over modern Beijing and Tianjin.\\n\\nIn spring 529, Emperor Xiaozhuang posthumously honored his father Yuan Xie as Emperor Wenmu and his mother Princess Li as Empress Wenmu, and enshrined them in the imperial ancestral temple, despite opposition by Yuan Yu (元彧) the Prince of Linhuai as being inappropriate since Yuan Xie was never actually emperor. He further also posthumously honored his brother Yuan Shao as Emperor Xiaoxuan and Yuan Shao's wife Princess Li as Empress Wengong, although he did not enshrine them in the imperial temple.\\n\\nAround the same time, rival Liang Dynasty's Emperor Wu created Emperor Xiaozhuang's cousin Yuan Hao the Prince of Beihai, who had fled to Liang following the Heyin Massacre, the Prince of Wei and sent an army commanded by the general Chen Qingzhi to escort him, with an intent to install Yuan Hao as Northern Wei's emperor as a vassal state to Liang. Emperor Xiaozhuang's administration did not consider Yuan Hao a serious threat at the moment, and instead sent a large army, commanded by Yuan Tianmu and Erzhu Rong's nephew Erzhu Zhao, to attack Xing first. Xing was captured and executed in summer 529, but Chen and Yuan Hao, who declared himself the emperor of Northern Wei upon entering Northern Wei territory, took the opportunity to capture Yingyang (滎陽, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), defeating Yuan Tianmu as he returned from the campaign against Xing, and approached Luoyang. Emperor Xiaozhuang decided to flee Luoyang, and he crossed the Yellow River to rendezvous with Erzhu Rong and Yuan Tianmu at Zhangzi (長子, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). Meanwhile, Yuan Hao entered Luoyang unopposed, and the provinces south of the Yellow River largely declared allegiance to Yuan Hao.\\n\\nYuan Hao, however, believed that he had already succeeded and began to plot against Chen and his Liang forces, wanting to throw off Liang's control. He therefore sent messengers to persuade Liang's Emperor Wu not to send any additional reinforcements. Erzhu's forces, meanwhile, were stymied against Chen, but eventually Erzhu made an attack at night and crossed the Yellow River, causing Yuan Hao's forces to collapse, and while Chen tried to withdraw, his army was defeated as well. Yuan Hao was killed in flight, and Emperor Xiaozhuang again entered Luoyang to assume the throne.\\n\\nIn spring 530, Erzhu Rong sent his nephew Erzhu Tianguang, assisted by the generals Heba Yue (賀拔岳) and Houmochen Yue (侯莫陳悅), to attack Moqi Chounu. Erzhu Tianguang, after tricking Moqi into believing that an attack would not come quickly, made a surprise attack, defeating Moqi and capturing him. He then captured Moqi's capital Gaoping (高平, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia), capturing Moqi's general Xiao Baoyin -- a former major Northern Wei general and Southern Qi prince who had, during Emperor Xiaoming's reign, unsuccessfully tried to reestablish Southern Qi. Moqi was executed, and while many officials friendly with Xiao tried to plead for Xiao's life, Emperor Xiaozhuang ordered Xiao to commit suicide. Erzhu Tianguang subsequently defeated another major rebel, Wang Qingyun (王慶雲), and Moqi Chounu's general Moqi Daoluo (万俟道洛), largely pacifying the western empire. Soon thereafter, Erzhu Rong's generals Hou Yuan (侯淵) and Liu Lingzhu defeated and killed Han Lou, and the empire became basically reunified.\\n\\nHowever, Emperor Xiaozhuang was secretly unhappy about these victories by the Erzhu forces, believing that this made an usurpation by Erzhu Rong closer to reality. Inside his own palace, he felt under pressure by the jealous Empress Erzhu. Erzhu Rong gave hints that he wanted to be awarded the nine bestowments -- symbols of great honor that usually preceded usurpations—but Emperor Xiaozhuang pretended not to understand, and did not bestow the nine bestowments on Erzhu. Yuan Hui (元徽) the Prince of Chengyang, the husband of Emperor Xiaozhuang's cousin, and Li Yu (李彧), Emperor Xiaozhuang's brother-in-law, both wanted more power, and saw the Erzhus as in their way, and therefore persuaded Emperor Xiaozhuang that one day Erzhu Rong would indeed usurp the throne. Emperor Xiaozhuang also feared a repeat of the Heyin Massacre, and therefore engaged his officials Yang Kan (楊侃) and Yuan Luo (元羅) in the conspiracy as well.\\n\\nIn autumn 530, with Empress Erzhu pregnant, Erzhu Rong requested to come to the capital to attend to his daughter for childbirth. Emperor Xiaozhuang's associates were divided in their opinions—some wanted to assassinate Erzhu when he came to the palace, and some wanted to slaughter Erzhu's associates in the capital and militarily resist. Emperor Xiaozhuang hesitated and did not take any actions initially. Meanwhile, Erzhu Shilong heard rumors of Emperor Xiaozhuang's conspiracy and reported them to Erzhu Rong, but Erzhu Rong did not believe that Emperor Xiaozhuang would dare to turn against him and therefore went to Luoyang anyway. The populace of Luoyang expected that either Erzhu Rong would carry out a coup or Emperor Xiaozhuang would act against him, and many fled. When Erzhu arrived at the capital, however, he entered the palace with minimal guards and without weapons, and so Emperor Xiaozhuang considered not acting against him. Yuan Hui, however, persuaded Emperor Xiaozhuang that even if Erzhu Rong was not planning a coup, that he still should not be allowed to be left alive.\\n\\nEmperor Xiaozhuang feared, however, that Yuan Tianmu, who was then at Jinyang, would be a latent threat, and therefore summoned Yuan Tianmu to the capital as well. Meanwhile, with rumors that Erzhu was planning to arrest Emperor Xiaozhuang and move the capital to Jinyang, Emperor Xiaozhuang became even more apprehensive and anxious to carry out the plot. He studied the historical accounts of the Han Dynasty general Dong Zhuo, and concluded that Wang Yun's failure, after he killed Dong, was in not pardoning Dong's associates, forcing them into rebellion. He therefore prepared first to kill Erzhu Rong and then to declare a general pardon. Under pretense that Empress Erzhu had given birth, he summoned Erzhu Rong and Yuan Tianmu into the palace and surprised and killed them. Also killed were Erzhu Rong's son Erzhu Puti (爾朱菩提) and Erzhu's attendants. The populace rejoiced at the news of Erzhu Rong's death, but Erzhu Rong's wife the Princess Beixiang and Erzhu Shilong fought their way out of the capital, initially camping at Heyin and demonstrating their military strength.\\n\\nEmperor Xiaozhuang sent messengers to Erzhu Shilong, declaring a general pardon, and issuing an \"iron certificate\" (鐵券, tie quan, which could be used against a death-eligible crime) to Erzhu Shilong if he would be willing to give up resisting. Erzhu Shilong refused, declaring that if Erzhu Rong could be killed after accomplishing so much, the certificate was meaningless. While Emperor Xiaozhuang's army was larger than Erzhu Shilong's, it was not as well-trained and could not decisively defeat Erzhu Shilong's. During this campaign, Empress Erzhu bore a son, and Emperor Xiaozhuang declared a general pardon. Erzhu Shilong eventually withdrew from Luoyang and joined the army of Erzhu Zhao, which advanced south from Jinyang after Erzhu Zhao heard of Erzhu Rong's death. They rendezvoused at Zhangzi and declared a distant relative of Emperor Xiaozhuang's, Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang, emperor. Meanwhile, Erzhu Tianguang also headed toward Luoyang, while claiming to be still supportive of Emperor Xiaozhuang.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Erzhu Zhao, after meeting Erzhu Shilong, quickly advanced on Luoyang. Around the new year 531, he had his army ride on horseback across the Yellow River, catching Emperor Xiaozhuang, who did not expect Erzhu Zhao to be able to cross the river easily, by surprise. Emperor Xiaozhuang's imperial guards collapsed, and he was captured by Erzhu Zhao's cavalry soldiers and imprisoned, less than three months after he killed Erzhu Rong. Erzhu Zhao killed Emperor Xiaozhuang's infant son, while allowing his soldiers to pillage Luoyang, killing many officials and raping many honored women.\\n\\n12 days after capturing Emperor Xiaozhuang, Erzhu Zhao had him delivered to Jinyang. While he was on the way, Gao Huan, who had been considering rebelling against Erzhu Zhao, considered a rescue mission to intercept Emperor Xiaozhuang's train, but missed the timing. Gao sent a letter to Erzhu Zhao, advising him not to kill the emperor, lest that he gain the ruinous reputation for having murdered an emperor. Erzhu Zhao, in anger, refused to accept Gao's advice. Emperor Xiaozhuang was imprisoned in a Buddhist temple in Jinyang, and 10 days after he left Luoyang, Erzhu Zhao had him strangled. He was not given a proper imperial burial until Gao overthrew the Erzhus in 532.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emperor Xuanzong of Tang", "body": "Emperor Xuanzong of Tang () ( 8 September 685- 3 May 762), also commonly known as Emperor Ming of Tang (), personal name Li Longji (李隆基), known as Wu Longji (武隆基) from 690 to 705, was the seventh emperor of the Tang dynasty in China, reigning from 712 to 756. His reign of 43 years was the longest during the Tang Dynasty. In the early half of his reign he was a diligent and astute ruler, ably assisted by capable chancellors like Yao Chong and Song Jing, and was credited with bringing Tang China to a pinnacle of culture and power. \\n\\nEmperor Xuanzong, however, was blamed for over-trusting Li Linfu, Yang Guozhong and An Lushan during his late reign, with Tang's golden age ending in the Anshi Rebellion.\\n\\nLi Longji was born at the Tang Dynasty eastern capital Luoyang in 685, during the first reign of his father Emperor Ruizong (Li Dan) – but at that time, Emperor Ruizong's mother Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), not Emperor Ruizong, was in actual control of power as empress dowager and regent. Li Longji was the third son of Emperor Ruizong, and his mother was Emperor Ruizong's concubine Consort Dou. In 687, as the emperor's son, he was created the Prince of Chu. It was said that he was handsome as a child, and was talented in music. He had two older brothers – Li Chengqi, born of Emperor Ruizong's wife Empress Liu, and Li Chengyi (李成義), as well as three younger brothers – Li Longfan (李隆範), Li Longye (李隆業), and Li Longti (李隆悌).\\n\\nIn 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as \"emperor\" of a new Zhou Dynasty, interrupting Tang. In 692, Li Longji and his brothers were allowed to have residences outside the palace and were given staffs at their mansions. In 693, both his mother Consort Dou and Li Dan's wife Crown Princess Liu (Li Dan's having been reduced to crown prince rank at that point) were killed by Wu Zetian inside the palace after Wu Zetian's lady in waiting Wei Tuan'er (韋團兒) falsely accused them of using witchcraft against Wu Zetian – and not even their bodies were recovered. Subsequently, all of Li Dan's sons were reduced in title, and Li Longji's title was reduced to Prince of Linzi, and he and his brothers, along with their cousins Li Guangshun (李光順) the Prince of Yifeng, Li Shouli the Prince of Yong, and Li Shouyi (李守義) the Prince of Yong'an (the sons of their uncle Li Xian, formerly crown prince but who had been forced by Wu Zetian to commit suicide in 684), were kept inside the palace and not allowed to have contact with outsiders. until 699, when they were allowed to leave the palace and taken up residences outside.\\n\\nIn 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and Li Longji's uncle Li Xian (note different person than the father of Li Guangshun, Li Shouli, and Li Shouyi), who was at that time crown prince (Li Dan having yielded that title to him in 698 and taken the title of Prince of Xiang), who had been briefly emperor prior to Li Dan, returned to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Li Longji was made the deputy minister of military supplies (衛尉少卿, Weiwei Shaoqing). In 708, he was made the secretary general of Lu Prefecture (潞州, roughly modern Changzhi, Shanxi). In 710, he was recalled to the capital Chang'an to attend to Emperor Zhongzong when Emperor Zhongzong was sacrificing to heaven and earth. Meanwhile, sorcerers engaged by Emperor Zhongzong believed that there was an aura of an emperor at the area of Chang'an where the mansions Li Longji and his uncles were, and Emperor Zhongzong tried to fulfill the vision by visiting Li Longji's mansion and attending a feast there. While Li Longji was back in Chang'an, he spent time to cultivate relationships with imperial guard commanders, as he believed that Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife Empress Wei would bring harm to the Tang Dynasty.\\n\\nIn summer 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly—a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning by Empress Wei and her daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle so that Empress Wei could become \"emperor\" like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could become crown princess. For the time being, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen, was named emperor (as Emperor Shang), but Empress Wei retained actual power as empress dowager and regent. Originally, under a plan put forth by Emperor Zhongzong's and Li Dan's sister Princess Taiping and Emperor Zhongzong's powerful concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er, Li Dan was to be named coregent, to assist Empress Wei, but under the opposition of two chancellor—Empress Wei's cousin Wei Wen and close associate Zong Chuke—Li Dan was not made coregent.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Empress Dowager Wei's clan members, along with Zong, Li Guo'er's husband Wu Yanxiu, and other officials Zhao Lüwen (趙履溫) and Ye Jingneng (葉靜能) were advising her to take the throne, like Wu Zetian did, and they also advised her to eliminate Li Dan and Princess Taiping. The official Cui Riyong leaked their plan to Li Longji. Li Longji responded by conspiring with Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's son Xue Chongjian (薛崇簡), as well as several low level officials close to him—Zhong Shaojing, Wang Chongye (王崇曄), Liu Youqiu, and Ma Sizong (麻嗣宗)—to act first. Meanwhile, Empress Wei's nephews Wei Bo (韋播) and Gao Song (高嵩), who had recently been put in command of imperial guards and who had tried to establish their authority by dealing with the guards harshly, had alienated the guards, and the guard officers Ge Fushun (葛福順), Chen Xuanli (陳玄禮), and Li Xianfu (李仙鳧) thereafter also joined the plot.\\n\\nWithout first informing Li Dan, the conspirators rose on 21 July, first killing Wei Bo, Gao, and Empress Wei's cousin Wei Gui (韋璿). They then attacked the palace. When Empress Dowager Wei panicked and fled to an imperial guard camp, a guard beheaded her. Li Guo'er, Wu Yanxiu, and Lady Helou were killed as well. Li Longji soon slaughtered a number of officials in Empress Dowager's faction as well as her clan, while displaying Empress Dowager Wei's body on the street. At the urging of Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi, Li Dan soon took the throne from Li Chongmao and again became emperor (as Emperor Ruizong).\\n\\nEmperor Ruizong was immediately faced with the issue of whom to make crown prince—as Li Chengqi, as the oldest son overall and the oldest son of his wife, was the appropriate heir under Confucian principles of succession, but Li Longji had been the one whose accomplishments had allowed him to retake the throne. He hesitated. Li Chengqi declined consideration to be crown prince—stating to his father:\\n\\nLi Chengqi wept and begged to yield for several days, and after further persuasion by the chancellor Liu Youqiu—who had been part of Li Longji's coup plans—Emperor Ruizong agreed, and created Li Longji crown prince. Li Longji submitted a petition offering to yield to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong rejected it.\\n\\nInitially, Princess Taiping agreed to Li Longji's ascension as crown prince despite the fact that Li Longji was not Emperor Ruizong's oldest son and was not born of Emperor Ruizong's wife Empress Liu (Li Chengqi was both — and therefore pursuant to Confucian principles of succession should have been crown prince, as she believed that Li Longji was young (25 at the time he was made crown prince) and would be easy to control. However, once she began to see that Li Longji was strong-willed, she became apprehensive and often had officials close to her publicly opine that Li Longji was an improper crown prince. She further often paid Li Longji's staff members to spy on him to try to find faults with him. She associated with a group of officials, including the chancellors Dou Huaizhen, Xiao Zhizhong, and Cen Xi, intending to find some way to remove Li Longji, but was unable to get two other chancellors — Wei Anshi and Song Jing — to join her group.\\n\\nIn 711, Song and another chancellor, Yao Yuanzhi, tried to persuade Emperor Ruizong to carry out a plan that they believed would end her plotting. They proposed that the two princes who arguably had superior claims on the throne than Li Longji — Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (whose father Li Xian (note different character than Emperor Zhongzong) was an older brother to both Emperors Zhongzong and Ruizong) — be sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as prefectural prefects, while Princess Taiping and Wu Youji be sent to live in Luoyang. They also proposed that Li Longji be put in charge of most affairs of state. Emperor Ruizong initially agreed and made the orders as Song and Yao suggested, except that he believed that Luoyang was too far and therefore sent Princess Taiping and Wu Youji only to Pu Prefecture (蒲州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). After Princess Taiping found out that the plan was conceived by Song and Yao, however, she was incensed and let Li Longji know her anger. In fear, Li Longji submitted a petition accusing Song and Yao of alienating him from his brothers Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (who was actually a cousin but was raised with Emperor Ruizong's sons) and aunt Princess Taiping, asking that the two be put to death. Emperor Ruizong, in response, demoted Song and Yao and recalled Princess Taiping, Li Chengqi, and Li Shouli to the capital. In the aftermaths, Li Longji submitted another request to yield the crown prince position to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong declined it. Also in 711, Emperor Ruizong posthumously honored both Empress Liu and Li Longji's mother Consort Dou as empresses and built a temple for them to be worshipped, but was unable to locate their bodies for reburial, and therefore had to give them a ceremonial reburial without the bodies. Emperor Ruizong also ordered that all minor matters be decided by Li Longji.\\n\\nIn 712, Princess Taiping had astrologers warn Emperor Ruizong that the constellation that symbolized the imperial throne, Dizuo (帝座), showed that there would be a change in the emperor's position — believing that Emperor Ruizong would suspect Li Longji of plotting a coup and that she could remove Li Longji this way. Instead, Emperor Ruizong, reasoning that the change in the emperor's position could be accounted by an orderly transition, offered to pass the throne to Li Longji. Princess Taiping fervently opposed it, and Li Longji initially declined, but at Emperor Ruizong's insistence finally accepted and took the throne on 8 September (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong retained much of the imperial power as Taishang Huang (retired emperor), and his edicts continued to carry greater force than Emperor Xuanzong's.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nEmperor Xuanzong made his wife Crown Princess Wang empress. Meanwhile, Princess Taiping continued to be highly influential in governmental matters through Emperor Ruizong, and most chancellors were her associates. (Of the seven chancellors at the time, five – Dou Huaizhen, Xiao Zhizhong, Cen Xi, Cui Shi, and Lu Xiangxian – were made chancellors at her recommendation, although Lu was not considered a member of her party.) Liu Youqiu and the general Zhang Wei (張暐), with Emperor Xuanzong's approval, planned to mobilize the imperial guards to kill several of those chancellors – Dou Huaizhen, Cui Shi and Cen Xi. However, after Zhang told the plan to the imperial censor Deng Guangbin (鄧光賓), the news was leaked. Liu was arrested, and initially set to be executed. Emperor Xuanzong interceded on his behalf with Emperor Ruizong, and Liu, Zhang, and Deng were spared but exiled.\\n\\nLater in 712, Emperor Ruizong decreed that Emperor Xuanzong lead a group of soldiers to examine the northern border. However, the group of conscripted soldiers was disbanded in spring 713, and the plan was never carried out.\\n\\nBy summer 713, it was said that Princess Taiping, Dou, Cen, Xiao, Cui; along with other officials Xue Ji, Li Jin (李晉) the Prince of Xinxing (a grandson of Li Deliang (李德良), a cousin of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu), Li You (李猷), Jia Yingfu (賈膺福), Tang Jun (唐晙); the generals Chang Yuankai (常元楷), Li Ci (李慈), and Li Qin (李欽); and the monk Huifan, were plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong. It was further said that they discussed, with the lady in waiting Lady Yuan to poison the gastrodia elata that Emperor Xuanzong routinely took as an aphrodisiac. When this alleged plot was reported to Emperor Xuanzong by Wei Zhigu, Emperor Xuanzong, who had already received advice from Wang Ju (王琚), Zhang Shuo, and Cui Riyong to act first, did so. He convened a meeting with his brothers Li Longfan the Prince of Qi and Li Longye the Prince of Xue (who had changed their names to Li Fan and Li Ye by this point to observe naming taboo for Emperor Xuanzong), Guo Yuanzhen, along with a number of his associates — the general Wang Maozhong (王毛仲), the officials Jiang Jiao (姜皎) and Li Lingwen (李令問), his brother-in-law Wang Shouyi (王守一), the eunuch Gao Lishi, and the military officer Li Shoude (李守德) — and decided to act first. On 29 July, Emperor Xuanzong had Wang Maozhong take 300 soldiers to the imperial guard camp to behead Chang and Li Ci. Then, Jia, Li You, Xiao, and Cen were arrested and executed as well. Dou fled into a canyon and committed suicide by hanging. Xue Ji was forced to commit suicide. When Emperor Ruizong heard about this, he quickly ascended the tower at Chengtian Gate (承天門) to ascertain what was happening. Guo reported to him Emperor Xuanzong's intentions, and Emperor Ruizong felt compelled to affirm Emperor Xuanzong's actions in an edict. The next day, Emperor Ruizong issued an edict transferring all authorities to Emperor Xuanzong and moved to a secondary palace, Baifu Hall (百福殿) and would remain there until his death in 716.\\n\\nEmperor Xuanzong's Kaiyuan era is usually viewed as one of the golden ages of Chinese history – a period of political stability, peace in society, and economic prosperity, in addition to advances in education, literature, music, painting, sculpture, and religion.\\n\\nthumbMeanwhile, Zhang Yue and Liu Youqiu served as chancellors, but they were soon displaced by Yao Yuanzhi (who then changed his name to Yao Chong) and Lu Huaishen. Changing the system of having a large group of chancellors simultaneous, as had been the case throughout Tang, Emperor Xuanzong reduced the numbers to two (or sometimes three) for the rest of his reign. Yao was considered a highly capable administrator, and with him ruling on most important matters and Lu assisting, the government was said to be highly efficient.\\n\\nIn 714, Emperor Xuanzong carried out a series of political reprisals against the cruel secret police officials of Wu Zetian's reign, exiling the ones that were still alive and eventually barring their descendants from holding political offices. At the urging of Jiang Jiao's brother Jiang Hui (姜誨), he also exiled a number of chancellors – Wei Sili, Wei Anshi, Zhao Yanzhao, and Li Jiao – from Emperor Zhongzong's reign whom Jiang accused of being unable to curb Empress Wei's abuse of power.\\n\\nAlso in 714, Emperor Xuanzong, wanting to punish the Khitan and the Xi for having defeated Tang forces during Emperor Zhongzong's reign, commissioned the general Xue Na to attack them, but Xue suffered another devastating loss to them, at the casualty rate of 80-90%. However, later in the year, when Tufan (Tibetan) forces attacked, Emperor Xuanzong again commissioned Xue to defend against the attack, and Xue was able to repel the Tufan forces. Subsequently, though, although both sides tried to invoke the marriage between Li Shouli's daughter Princess Jincheng and Tufan's king Me Agtsom in seeking peace, the two sides could not reach an agreement and remained in border conflict yearly. In response, Emperor Xuanzong established the office of jiedushi (military governor) of Longyou Circuit (隴右, headquartered in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai), with a centralized command of 12 prefectures under a single military general. Eventually, the establishment of jiedushi would be extended to other parts of the empire.\\n\\nAlso in 714, Emperor Xuanzong created Li Siqian, his second son and the son of his then-favorite concubine Consort Zhao, crown prince. (Emperor Xuanzong's wife Empress Wang was sonless.)\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Tang relationship with Eastern Tujue's khan Ashina Mochuo had fluctuated during the first few years of the Kaiyuan era, as minor hostilities occurred at the borders as well as contests over vassals' loyalty for the two states, but they were also at times friendly to each other, with Ashina Mochuo requesting at times to marry a Tang princess and Emperor Xuanzong agreeing to the proposal. In 716, however, Ashina Mochuo was killed in battle against the Bayegu (拔野古), and from that point on, lacking his efficient leadership, Eastern Tujue, while remaining an important regional power, posed much less of a threat to China, although at times still capable of dealing serious defeats to Tang forces, as was the case in 720 when the Eastern Tujue general Tunyugu defeated the Tang garrison at Liang Prefecture (涼州, roughly modern Wuwei, Gansu) and the Tang vassal Baximi (拔悉密). Meanwhile, Tang, Tufan, and the Umayyad Caliphate were constantly engaging in a three-way tug of war for influence in the Xiyu (i.e., modern Xinjiang and former Soviet Central Asia) region. In 715, for example, when the king of Bahanna (拔汗那) was expelled by a new king supported by Tufan and the Umayyad Caliphate, Tang forces commanded by the general Zhang Xiaosong (張孝嵩) attacked the new king and restored the old king.right\\n\\nIn and around 716, there was a major locust infestation in the central China region. At Yao's suggestion, Emperor Xuanzong ordered an extensive campaign of extermination, which was said to reduce the impact of the infestation and ward off a major famine. Later in 716, however, due a corruption scandal involving Yao's sons and his associate Zhao Hui (趙誨), Yao incurred displeasure from Emperor Xuanzong and offered to resign. He and Yuan Qianyao, who replaced Lu after Lu's death earlier in 716, were removed from their offices and replaced with Song Jing and Su Ting, with Song making more of the important decisions and Su assisting. Yao would not return to the chancellorship, but would remain influential as a key advisor for Emperor Xuanzong until Yao's death in 721. Contrary to the practical and flexible Yao, Song was more interested in emphasizing integrity and rule of law in governance, and it was said that while Yao's and Song's emphases were different, they were both regarded as instrumental in establishing the rule of Kaiyuan and that subsequent chancellors could not compare to them.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Song and Su had carried out a stern campaign against the use of coins that were not officially forged by the government, which brought popular resentment that Emperor Xuanzong found problematic. In 720, he removed Song and Su from chancellor offices and replaced them with Yuan and Zhang Jiazhen, and in 721 added Zhang Yue as a chancellor as well.\\n\\nMeanwhile, by 722, Empress Wang, who had contributed to Emperor Xuanzong's reign by providing suggestions, had begun to lose favor to Consort Wu, a great-grandniece of Emperor Xuanzong's grandmother Wu Zetian. Emperor Xuanzong secretly discussed with Jiang Jiao the possibility of deposing her, but Jiang Jiao careless leaked the discussion. At the urging of Zhang Jiazhen, who was friendly with Empress Wang's brother Wang Shouyi (王守一), advocated that Jiang Jiao be punished and exiled, and Jiang died in exile.\\n\\nMeanwhile, at Zhang Yue's suggestion, the Tang northern border defense forces, which had about 600,000 men at that time, was reduced by 200,000 men to allow the soldiers to return home. Further, seeing that the Tang conscription system, due to abuses against the soldiers at the time, was near a collapse, as the soldiers were forced into long tours of duty but their families were not exempt from taxes, thus causing great numbers of desertions, Zhang suggested a switch to a recruitment-based system where soldiers were paid salaries. This allowed, for a time, Tang's soldier supply to be replenished. (Some later historians condemned Zhang for the abolition of the conscription system, believing the abolition to be the root of Tang's later fracturing, but some others, such as the modern historian Bo Yang, argued that Zhang's actions not only were necessary to restore the supply of soldiers but saved many lives.)\\n\\nthumbIn 723, Zhang Jiazhen was demoted on account of a corruption scandal involving his brother Zhang Jiayou (張嘉祐). His position was filled by Wang Jun, who was soon himself demoted over suspicions, never proven, that he was plotting treason. With Zhang Yue thus effectively being the senior chancellor, Zhang Yue promoted literary studies, which Emperor Xuanzong also favored. In 724, he also commissioned the chief imperial astronomer Nangong Shuo (南宮說) to carry out a major astronomical survey to observe the sun and the North Star at various points of the empire.\\n\\nAlso in 724, it was discovered that Wang Shouyi had engaged sorcerers to make amulets for Empress Wang to wear, hoping that the use of magic would allow her to have a son. Empress Wang was deposed and reduced to commoner rank, while Emperor Shouyi was exiled and subsequently ordered to commit suicide in exile. Empress Wang died later in the year, and it was said that the eunuchs and the ladies in waiting mourned her bitterly and Emperor Xuanzong much regretted his treatment of her. Still, after Empress Wang's removal and death, Consort Wu became undisputed mistress of the palace and was treated inside the palace like an empress would be. Still, in 726, when Emperor Xuanzong considered creating her empress, he encountered oppositions from officials on two grounds – that her Wu clan was hated by the people and that as she had her own sons, the position of Li Siqian the Crown Prince (whose name had been changed to Li Hong by this point) would be threatened. As a result, Emperor Xuanzong never created her empress.\\n\\nIn winter 725, Emperor Xuanzong, at Zhang Yue's urging, carried out a magnificent ceremony at Mount Tai to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth.\\n\\nIn 726, Zhang Yue was accused of corruption by several officials that he had blocked the advances of – Cui Yinfu (崔隱甫), Yuwen Rong, and Li Linfu – and was found to have committed corruption. At the intercession of Gao Lishi, however, Zhang Yue was removed only from his chancellor post and permitted to maintain his title and a number of other posts. He was replaced by Li Yuanhong, and subsequently, Du Xian was also added as a chancellor.\\n\\nIn 727, at the suggestion of the general Wang Junchuo (王君㚟), Emperor Xuanzong commissioned Wang Junchuo to attack Tufan, and after a Tufan incursion in late 726, Wang counterattacked and inflicted losses on Tufan forces commanded by the general Xinuoluogonglu (悉諾邏恭祿). Later in the year, though, Xinuoluogonglu and another general, Zhulongmangbuzhi (燭龍莽布支) attacked and captured Wang's home prefecture Gua Prefecture (瓜州, roughly modern Jiuquan, Gansu), taking Wang's father Wang Shou (王壽) captive. As a result, Wang Junchuo did not dare to counterattack, and subsequently blamed the defeat on a number of tribal chiefs in the area and had them exiles. In response, Yaoluoge Hushu (藥羅葛護輸), the nephew of one of the chiefs so exiled, Yaoluoge Chengzong (藥羅葛承宗), ambushed Wang Junchuo and killed him, and while Yaoluoge Hushu was forced to flee thereafter, for several years Tang did not engage in any offensive campaigns in the region.\\n\\nAround the same time, Emperor Xuanzong began to build a residential complex in the palace for imperial clan members, known as the Mansion of the Ten Princes (十王院), to centralize their residence. Thereafter, imperial princes, including the crown prince, would rarely live outside the palace complex.\\n\\nIn 728, Emperor Xuanzong added the general Xiao Song as a chancellor. Subsequently, in 729, with Yuan, even though he was senior chancellor, unable to curb the disputes between Li Yuanhong and Du, Emperor Xuanzong removed all three from chancellor positions, promoting Yuwen and Pei Guangting to be chancellors in their stead – in Yuwen's case, for his abilities to find ways to add to the imperial treasury by imposing special taxes and levies. Later in the year, though, Yuwen made false accusations against the general Li Hui (李褘) the Prince of Xin'an (Emperor Xuanzong's second cousin) and was exiled, and subsequently died in exile. Still, it was said that it was starting from Yuwen's times that Emperor Xuanzong began to pay attention on taxes to replenish the imperial treasury, which traditional historians viewed as the start of his inflicting financial burdens on the people. Further, with Pei in charge of the civil service system, it was said that due to Pei's strict adherence to seniority, the Tang civil service system began to lose its ability to find talented people to serve in offices.\\n\\nIn 730, the Khitan general Ketugan (可突干) killed the king Li Shaogu (李邵固) and took over the reign of the Khitan and the Xi personally, forcing the king of the Xi, Li Lusu (李魯蘇) to flee to Tang for protection. Tang sent an army to attack the Khitan, but meanwhile made peace with Tufan. Initially, the campaign against the Khitan did not succeed, but in 732, with Li Hui in command, Tang forces dealt Ketugan a serious defeat and causing many of Ketugan's subordinates to defect and submit to Tang, although Ketugan was not captured.\\n\\nthumbMeanwhile, Tang also began to have periodic conflicts with Balhae, and in 733 Emperor Xuanzong tried to commission Dae Mun-ye (大門藝), the brother of Balhae's King Mu, to attack Balhae, along with forces from Silla, but the attack was not successful.\\n\\nAlso in 733, Pei Guangting died, and at the recommendation of Xiao Song, he was replaced with Han Xiu, but soon, Song and Han were in repeated conflicts, and late in 733, both were removed and replaced with Pei Yaoqing, who became known for improving the food distribution system, and Zhang Jiuling, known for his integrity. In 734, Emperor Xuanzong added Li Linfu, a close associate of Consort Wu, as a chancellor as well.\\n\\nAround the new year 735, Ketuhan was killed in an internal Khitan power struggle, and Khitan became a vassal again, although it would not stay so permanently.\\n\\nBy 736, Emperor Xuanzong was described as having been tired of important affairs of state and beginning to become wasteful and exuberant in his lifestyle. Zhang tried to curb his behavior but thus began to lose favor, while Li LInfu was gaining power due to his association with Consort Wu. Further, Zhang supported Li Hong (whose name had been changed to Li Ying by this point), while Li Linfu and Consort Wu supported her son Li Mao (李瑁) the Prince of Shou and tried to have Li Mao made crown prince. In 736, due to Li Linfu's machinations that made Emperor Xuanzong believed that Zhang and Pei Yaoqing were improperly engaging in factionalism, Zhang and Pei Yaoqing were removed and replaced by Niu Xianke, who closely followed Li Linfu's will, and thereafter, Li Linfu would dominate the imperial government almost to the end of Emperor Xuanzong's reign. Li Linfu did all he could to stay in power, and carried out many dirty tricks against actual or potential threats to his power. He also severely discouraged criticism, ending the relative freedom that officials had to make proposals to Emperor Xuanzong. This was often viewed by traditional historians as the turning point of Emperor Xuanzong's reign, which up to that point was considered a golden age in Chinese history, toward a path of degeneration. The Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, for example, commented:\\n\\nIn 737, with Zhang no longer in the government to protect him, Li Ying was deposed and subsequently forced to commit suicide. However, with Consort Wu dying later in the year, Emperor Xuanzong did not immediately accept Li Linfu's proposal to have Li Mao made crown prince. Rather, he chose an older son, Li Yu the Prince of Zhong, in 738.\\n\\nthumbHistorians said that Emperor Xuanzong has forced tens of thousand beautiful women to live in his palace to please him, more than many other Tang emperors. And he did not allow many to set free even when they were old. As Emperor Xuanzong turned his attention to pleasure-seeking with his favorite concubine Consort Yang Yuhuan (Yang Guifei) and her family, he paid less and less attention to the running of his empire, and much of his power fell into the hands of the corrupt Li Linfu (who was succeeded by Lady Yang's dissolute cousin Yang Guozhong) and the eunuch Gao Lishi.\\n\\nAt the same time, 751 saw the loss of the Battle of Talas against the Abbasid Caliphate. As a consequence, the Tang Dynasty temporarily lost some of its influence in Central Asia to the emerging Abbasid Caliphate, as several Tang tributaries turned to the Abbasids.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the jiedushi (military governors), most of whom were non-Han took more and more regional power into their own hands. Some successful generals included Geshu Han, known for victories over Tufan; Gao Xianzhi, who conquered city states of the Xiyu region, eventually battling the Abbasids at Talas; and An Lushan who defeated and once again vassalized the Khitan. Eventually, in 755, An Lushan started the Anshi Rebellion at Fanyang. The rebels quickly seized the eastern capital Luoyang, and then the imperial capital Chang'an six months later. Emperor Xuanzong fled to Sichuan during the war and abdicated the throne to Li Yu (whose name had been changed to Li Heng at that point) (as Emperor Suzong).\\n\\nMeanwhile, it had been the case that, at Li Linfu's encouragement, Emperor Xuanzong began to promote non-Han generals to command large border armies, believing Li Linfu's assertion that non-Han generals were more likely to be personally loyal to Emperor Xuanzong himself and would not have clan entanglements, even though Li Linfu's own personal motivation was to prevent Han officials from going through the border command route to become chancellors, thus threatening him. Such generals who rose in ranks included An Lushan, An Sishun, Geshu Han, and Gao Xianzhi. By 742, the main Tang forces were all concentrated on the border, at nine different military circuits and one special military district (Lingnan), as well as three special coast defense districts (Changle, Donglai, and Dongmou):\\n\\nMeanwhile, it was said that Emperor Xuanzong had paid less attention to increasing revenues after Yuwen Rong's fall, but by 742 he was again interested in doing so, and such officials as Wei Jian (韋堅, a brother-in-law of Li Yu, whose name was changed by this point to Li Heng), Wang Hong (王鉷), and Yang Shenjin (楊慎矜) became favored, and often, matters having to do with finances were stripped out of other officials' responsibilities and given to them as special commissions.\\n\\nLate in 742, Niu Xianke died and was replaced by Li Shizhi.\\n\\nIn 744, Eastern Tujue, after a series of internal turmoil and rebellions from its vassals, finally collapsed. Its vassal Huige rose and became the dominant power of the region, but formally submitted to Tang as a vassal.\\n\\nthumbMeanwhile, after Consort Wu's death, Emperor Xuanzong had been depressed. When he saw his son Prince of Shou Li Mao's wife (his daughter-in-law) Yang Yuhuan (Princess of Shou, by virtue of marriage), he was infatuated with her, and he had her become a Taoist nun and gave Li Mao the wife of the general Wei Zhaoxun (韋昭訓) as his new wife and princess. Meanwhile, he secretly took the nun, Yang, into the palace. She became his senior-ranking concubine (''guifei''), known as Yang Guifei, and soon became so powerful that officials were bribing her family members to get preferential treatment. She was referred to inside the palace as \"the Lady\" and treated like an empress.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Li Linfu was beginning to conflict with Li Shizhi and Wei Jian, who were allies. Li Linfu, who engaged a group of secret police officials to investigate and manufacture evidence against political enemies, were able to get Wei and Li Shizhi demoted and exiled in 746. (Li Shizhi was replaced by Chen Xilie, who gained favor from Emperor Xuanzong for his knowledge in Taoism and sorcery.) In 747, Li Linfu further carried out a campaign of terror against exiled officials, and among the officials executed were Wei, Li Yong (李邕) and Pei Dunfu (裴敦復). Li Shizhi and Wang Ju, who had been instrumental in Emperor Xuanzong's initial actions against Princess Taiping, committed suicide.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in 747, Emperor Xuanzong wanted to expand the government's talent pool, and so issued an edict ordering that the people who had unusual talents to come to Chang'an to be examined by himself. Li Linfu, fearing that these examinees might accuse him of improprieties when they get to meet the emperor, suggested that these examinees go through two levels of preliminary examinations – by the local governments, and then by the executive bureau. As a result, no one passed the first two levels of preliminary examinations, and Li LInfu subsequently submitted a note to Emperor Xuanzong congratulating him that no talent has been overlooked by the imperial administration.\\n\\nthumbMeanwhile, also as of 747, An Lushan had become greatly favored by Emperor Xuanzong due to his military achievements and his willingness to flatter Emperor Xuanzong, Consort Yang, and her family members. Further, Li Linfu, apprehensive about the general Wang Zhongsi, who at that time was in command of four circuits (Hexi, Longyou, Shuofang, and Hedong), deprecated Wang in favor of An Lushan. In 747, after Li Linfu implicated Wang in hindering a campaign against Tufan and further accused Wang of plotting a coup to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong and replace him with Li Heng, Wang was arrested and demoted, escaping death only at the pleas of Geshu, who was Wang's deputy and who subsequently was given the commands of Hexi and Longyou. An Lushan, who had already been in command of Fanyang and Pinglu Circuits, was also given Hedong, and thereafter was in command of the most elite troops of the empire. Meanwhile, the ethnically Goguryeo general Gao Xianzhi had become prominent in the Xiyu region, expanding Tang power to the west.\\n\\nBy 748, Consort Yang's cousins Yang Guozhong, Yang Xian (楊銛) and Yang Qi (楊錡), as well as her three sisters (who were created the Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin), had become exceedingly wealthy and powerful due to the favors that Emperor Xuanzong showed them. It was said that their wealth topped all households in Chang'an. It was also said that by 749, the empire was so wealthy that Emperor Xuanzong viewed treasures as expendable and so awarded them without limit.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Li Linfu had a tight grip on power and favors from Emperor Xuanzong throughout the years, but as of 750, Yang Guozhong and Chen Xilie had allied with each other and were finding ways to eliminate Li Linfu's allies from government.\\n\\nAs of 751, Tang was also facing defeats on two different external fronts – as Nanzhao's king Geluofeng (閤羅鳳), angry about unreasonable demands that the Zhang Qiantuo (張虔陀) the governor of Yunnan Commandery (雲南, roughly modern Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan) and Zhang's subsequent false accusations that he was planning to rebel, rebelled for real, and attacked and occupied Yunnan Commandery. A major attack by the general Xianyu Zhongtong (鮮于仲通) against Nanzhao failed terribly in 751, and subsequent defeats by Tang forces eventually led to a total of some 200,000 casualties among Tang troops. On the western front, Gao Xianzhi suffered a major defeat at the Abbasid forces at the Battle of Talas in 751 as well, ending the Tang expansion to the west.\\n\\nIn 752, Wang Hong's brother Wang Han (王銲) was accused of treason after his associates rose in a failed coup at Chang'an. In the aftermaths, Wang Hong was forced to commit suicide, and Yang Guozhong, Chen, and Geshu Han further tried to implicate Li Linfu in the plot as well. After Li LInfu died in winter 752, Yang Guozhong succeeded him, and almost immediately accused Li LInfu of having been complicit in the rebellion of another general, Li Xianzhong (李獻忠). Li LInfu was posthumously disgraced, and his family was exiled.\\n\\nA rivalry soon developed between Yang Guozhong and An Lushan, and Yang Guozhong began to repeatedly warn Emperor Xuanzong that An was plotting rebellion. Emperor Xuanzong ignored the warnings. In 754, Yang Guozhong suggested that if An were summoned to the capital, he would surely refuse, and Emperor Xuanzong decided to try An – and An arrived in Chang'an immediately after being summoned. After this incident, Emperor Xuanzong no longer believed that An was plotting rebellion. Nevertheless, because of Yang Guozhong's opposition, he did not make An chancellor, as he was planning. Also in 754, with Yang Guozhong also trying to squeeze Chen out of the government, Chen resigned and was replaced by Wei Jiansu.\\n\\nthumbIn 755, Yang Guozhong further provoked An, who was then back at his post in Fanyang, by surrounding An's mansion at Chang'an and arresting and executing An's staff members. An, in fear and anger, rebelled in winter 755, and quickly reached and captured Luoyang after defeating Feng Changqing's undersupplied army. Subsequently, Emperor Xuanzong, believing in reports from the eunuch Bian Lingcheng (邊令誠) that Feng was cowardly and that Feng's superior Gao Xianzhi was corrupt, executed both Feng and Gao and replaced Gao with Geshu in defending Tong Pass from An's advances. An declared himself emperor of a new state of Yan at Luoyang, but with Geshu defending Tong Pass, An's advances stalled, while Tang forces commanded by Li Guangbi and Guo Ziyi made advances against An-controlled territory north of the Yellow River. Meanwhile, though, Yang Guozhong, fearing that Geshu had designs against him, convinced Emperor Xuanzong to order Geshu to attack despite Geshu's warnings that doing so was risky. Geshu was subsequently defeated by An's forward commander Cui Qianyou (崔乾祐), and Tong Pass fell. With An's forces advancing on Chang'an, on 14 July 756, Emperor Xuanzong, with Yang Guozhong suggesting that they flee to Jiannan Circuit, abandoned Chang'an and fled with Gao Lishi, Yang Guozhong, Wei, Li Heng, Consort Yang, and her family. The following day, 15 July, the imperial guards accompanying the emperor, angry at Yang Guozhong, rose and killed him and forced Emperor Xuanzong to kill Consort Yang as well. Subsequently, Emperor Xuanzong continued on to Jiannan, but Li Heng did not, but rather went to Lingwu, where, on 12 August, Li Heng was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong). Meanwhile, without knowledge that Emperor Suzong had claimed the throne, Emperor Xuanzong, while still on his way to Chengdu, the capital of Jiannan Circuit, issued an edict that gave several of his sons various responsibility areas, under Li Heng's command overall; until this edict was issued, most of the realm only knew that Chang'an had fallen and had not known where Emperor Xuanzong had fled. When the news of Emperor Suzong's ascension reached Emperor Xuanzong at Chengdu on 10 September, he recognized Emperor Suzong as the new emperor, and thereafter took the title of Taishang Huang (retired emperor) – although his edict recognizing Emperor Suzong appeared to still indicate desire to retain control like his father Emperor Ruizong did early in his reign:\\n\\nHowever, perhaps to avoid the impression that he was keeping a rival government to Emperor Suzong, he sent the several chancellors that he had retained or created while on the journey to or after he arrived in Chengdu – Wei, Fang Guan, and Cui Huan – to Lingwu to formally invest imperial power on Emperor Suzong and to serve under Emperor Suzong.\\n\\nEmperor Xuanzong, after becoming retired emperor, largely allowed Emperor Suzong to coordinate the campaign against Yan, but at times nevertheless stepped in to make decisions. For example, in spring 757, apparently without first consulting Emperor Suzong, he named Li Lin chancellor, although he subsequently sent both Li Lin and another chancellor, Cui Yuan, whom he had not sent to Emperor Suzong previously, to Emperor Suzong. He also posthumously honored Emperor Suzong's mother Consort Yang as an empress. Meanwhile, remembering Zhang Jiuling had previously warned about An Lushan, Emperor Xuanzong sent messengers to Zhang's tomb to offer sacrifices to him.\\n\\nLate in 757, Emperor Suzong, with aid from Huige, recaptured Chang'an from Yan, then ruled by An Lushan's son An Qingxu, who had killed An Lushan earlier in 757 and taken over the throne himself. After Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an, he sent messengers to Emperor Xuanzong requesting that he return to Chang'an and offering the throne back to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong, apprehensive of the offer, initially not only declined but further requested to remain in Jiannan. Only after Emperor Suzong, at the suggestion of his strategist Li Mi, had the government officials make a joint submission to Emperor Xuanzong no longer mentioning the return of the throne, did Emperor Xuanzong agree to depart Jiannan to return to Chang'an. On the way back to Chang'an, he had Gao Lishi try to dig up Consort Yang's body for reburial, but her body had already decomposed; only her fragrance bag remained. Emperor Xuanzong took the fragrance bag back to Chang'an and visited it daily, as if Consort Yang were still alive. On 16 January 758, he arrived at Chang'an, and in a grand ceremony where Emperor Suzong offered the throne back to him again, he formally declined again and personally put on the yellow robe symbolizing imperial status on Emperor Suzong, commenting, \"I had been the Son of Heaven for 50 years, and I did not consider it a great honor. Now I am truly honored to be the father to the Son of Heaven.\" He took up residence at Xingqing Palace, a palace that was remodelled from the residence that he and his brothers had when they were imperial princes.\\n\\nAfter Emperor Xuanzong was back in Chang'an, he largely stayed out of policy decisions, although he at times still exerted his influence on Emperor Suzong. For example, Emperor Suzong had wanted to spare Zhang Shuo's sons Zhang Jun (張均) and Zhang Ji (張垍), who had previously submitted to An Lushan, because of Zhang Shuo's contributions and Zhang Jun's and Zhang Ji's prior efforts to protect him from Li Linfu's machinations, but Emperor Xuanzong deeply hated them for having surrendered to An, and at Emperor Xuanzong's insistence, Zhang Jun was executed, and Zhang Ji was exiled to Lingnan.\\n\\nMeanwhile, after a while, Emperor Xuanzong settled into a routine at Xingqing Palace, with Chen Xuanli and Gao Lishi attending to him. Also often attending to him were his daughter Li Chiying (李持盈) the Princess Yuzhen, the lady in waiting Ru Xianyuan (如仙媛), and the eunuchs Wang Cheng'en (王承恩) and Wei Yue (魏悅). The imperial musicians often played for him, and he often climbed up Changqing Tower (長慶樓) to receive well wishes from the populace. He also often held feasts for generals and people from Jiannan, with Li Chiying and Ru serving as hostesses. Meanwhile, though, Emperor Xuanzong's attendants looked down at the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo, who had served Emperor Suzong throughout the campaign against Yan. To retaliate, Li Fuguo began to try to convince Emperor Suzong that Emperor Xuanzong and his attendants were plotting to seize power back. In 760, with Emperor Suzong's tacit, although not explicit, approval, on one occasion when Emperor Xuanzong was out riding, Li Fuguo intercepted him and forced him to move back to the main palace. Even on that occasion, however, Gao would not submit to Li Fuguo, and even yelled at Li Fuguo to force him to get off his horse and to escort Emperor Xuanzong on foot, along with Gao. Soon after Emperor Xuanzong was forcibly moved, Li Fuguo forced Chen to retire, Li Chiying to return to her temple (she had become an ordained Taoist nun in 711), and exiled Gao, Wang, Wei, and Ru.\\n\\nAfter Emperor Xuanzong was forcibly moved back to the main palace, Emperor Suzong tried to please him by offering him the best of all of the tributes of the land first, but Emperor Xuanzong became depressed and rarely ate meat, and quickly became ill. Emperor Suzong had his daughters Princesses Wan'an and Xianyi attend to their grandfather, and initially frequently personally visited Emperor Xuanzong, but after some time became ill himself and could not visit Emperor Xuanzong. He began to regret forcibly moving Emperor Xuanzong and considered killing Li Fuguo, but as Li Fuguo wielded command of the imperial guards at this time, he did not dare to try to do so. Emperor Xuanzong died, in that depressed state, on 3 May 762.\\n\\nEmperor Xuanzong was deeply criticized by later historians for his wastefulness and for his appointing of Li Linfu, Yang Guozhong, and An to prominent offices. The modern People's Republic of China leader Mao Zedong said that Emperor Xuanzong was \"half bright, half dark.\" The strength that Xuanzong had allowed the military governors to have, which was perpetuated after Tang had defeated Yan, led to a period of increasing conflict and instability which set the stage for the decline of the Tang Dynasty and the ensuing Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period.\\n\\n</center>\\n\\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"|-|-\\n\\n"}

However, great advances occurred in textual criticism during the last half of the 19th century culminating in Brooke Foss Westcott's and Fenton John Anthony Hort's Greek text of the New Testament.

Empire Earth Mobile was written in Java form, and was developed by Vivendi instead of Stainless Steel Studios (the makers of Empire Earth). It was released on October 14th, 2005 by mobile game distributor WonderPhone. \\n\\nEmpire Earth Mobile is turn-based strategy game, more like Civilization than the original Empire Earth. The game covers four epochs; Stone, Middle, Modern and Nano. The game separates itself from the other Empire Earth games with the absence of citizens. Instead, certain symbols lie on the map which can be conquered by a soldier unit. When they are, a new building can be created. However, only a certain number of symbols exist on the map, so each side competes for control of them.rightMobile gives the player control of four types of units, each that varies and changes in different epochs. The standard soldier, which can be useful for building new structures, ranged units, heavy support units, and aerial units. The latter of the four is only available in later epochs.\\n\\nMobile has three game modes: adventure, skirmish and multiplayer. Adventure mode takes the player though 10 campaign levels, totaling 2,000 years of human history. It begins in the Prehistory and finishes in the Nano age, similar to Empire Earth. Skirmish is a free-for-all solo battle, with multiplayer mode introducing the possibility of two player combat.\\n\\nMobile, upon release, was the seventh Vivendi title to be ported and the one of three that year based on major franchises.\\n\\nMobile was generally well received by the mobile community.

{"title": "Employee referral", "body": "Employee referral is an internal recruitment method employed by organization to identify potential candidates from their existing employees' social networks. An employee referral scheme encourages a company's existing employees to select and recruit the suitable candidates from their social networks. As a reward, the employer typically pays the referring employee a referral bonus. Recruiting candidates using employee referral is widely acknowledged as being the most cost effective and efficient recruitment method to recruit candidates and as such, employers of all sizes, across all industries are trying to increases the volumes they recruit through this channel. \\n\\nProponents of employee referral schemes claim the benefits to be an improved candidate quality, ‘fit’, and retention levels, while at the same time delivering a significant reduction in recruitment expenditure.However, there are a number of potential drawbacks. One of the greatest concerns tends to be that relying too heavily on employee referrals could limit diversity in the workplace, with new staff recruited in the likeness of existing employees. But, provided that there is already a diverse workforce in place this ceases to be such an issue. \\n\\nAccording to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development's 2004 recruitment and retention survey, which showed more than eight out of 10 employers experienced recruitment difficulties, 38% of UK employers used employee referral schemes as a way of finding staff. This was up 4% on the previous year.\\n\\nThe one-to-one direct relationship between the candidate and the referring employee and the exchange of knowledge that takes place allows the candidate to develop a strong understanding of the company, its business and the application and recruitment process. With this information the candidate is ideally placed to assess their own suitability and likelihood of success at the company and make an informed decision, with the support of the referring employee as to whether to apply. This is the start of the company’s recruitment process where, at no cost to the employer, candidates and employees remove unsuitable and poor quality candidates, from the recruitment process ensuring a consistently high quality of applications\\n\\nCandidates who are interviewed are thoroughly prepared resulting in superior interview to job offer conversion rates. In addition, successful candidates get up to speed faster compared to other recruitment methods. Candidate ‘fit’ to the company’s culture, departments and teams is improved as the expectations of candidate and employer match. This significantly increases the level of staff retention and builds a loyal and committed workforce - ultimately reducing the company’s future recruitment requirements\\n\\nEmployee referral scheme’s allows existing employees to screen, select and refer only the best candidates to the recruitment process. This eliminates the often considerable cost of third parties service providers who would have previously conducted the screening and selection process\\n\\nThe costs of operating an employee referral scheme extends to the cash bonus’ paid to employees and internal promotion and administration, the total of which is considerably lower than the expense of recruiting using traditional recruitment consultants, headhunters and online recruitment methods\\n\\nAs candidate quality improves and interview to job offer conversion rates increase the amount of time spent interviewing decreases meaning the company’s Human Resources headcount can be streamlined and be used more efficiently. Marketing and advertising spend decreases as existing employees source potential candidates from the existing personal networks of friends, family, acquaintances and associates.\\n\\nThe opportunity to improve candidate quality, ‘fit’, and retention levels, while at the same time significantly reduce recruitment expenditure has seen the emphasis employers place on increasing the volume of recruits by employer referral increase dramatically. However, there are number of obstacles to achieving the desired increase:\\n\\nAn employee referral scheme is only as good as the volume and quality of candidates applying through the channel.\\n\\n \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Encyclopædia Perthensis", "body": "The Encyclopaedia Perthensis or \"Universal Dictionary of KNOWLEDGE collected from every source and intended to supersede the use of all other English books of reference\" was published in Perth, Scotland by C. Mitchel and Co. It has twenty-three 8vo volumes with plates and maps. The plates and maps were intended to be bound in to the main text as described in the directions for placing the plates.\\n\\nThe majority of the 370 plates and maps claimed by the second edition, where credited, are signed T Clerk Sculpt. Edinr. Two other artists, J Stewart and J Frasier, have signed plates. Interestingly, though 370 plates and maps are claimed on the title pages, there are only directions for the placement of 348 plates, of which only one could be described as a map, a plan of Washington, D.C. in 1800 by Andrew Ellicott.\\n\\nAs can be seen below, the main contributor and editor was one Alexander Aitchison, a Member of the Royal Physical Society. However, a note dated 1810 records the death on April 14, 1809 of Mr J. Morrison of Perth, \"Editor and Publisher of this Encyclopedia - a teacher of religion of the Society of Glasgites\". This is presumably the same man referred to in the National Library of Scotland's Scottish Book Trade Index as James Morison printer though his date of death is given as February 20. \\n\\nA supplement was published in 1816; printed in Edinburgh by John Brown.\\n\\nIn all the affairs of man, nothing contributes so much to his comfort as ARRANGEMENT. It is the saviour of much time, trouble and expense; and the author of much ease and convenience. The application of such remarks to literature, is obvious and natural; but for the arrangement of Geography into Gazetteers, or of Biography into Dictionaries, how many days might be occupied in ascertaining the site of a city, or the aera of a name? Such books being found absolutely necessary therefore, every Art and Science gradually obtained its Dictionary; and, still improving, they collected under alphabetical arrangement in ONE book - this book, at first a little volume, gradually improved and enlarged into the Encyclopaediae of the present day; and the incredible number of copies of the different works bearing this title which have been sold, and are daily selling, affords a better proof of the utility of such laborious compilations than any reasoning.\\n\\nThe most voluminous and best arranged LIBRARY is not so useful or convenient for consultation, upon any branch or term of science, to the majority of Readers, as a complete and well arranged Encyclopaedia.\\n\\nIn forming the plan of this work, the properties as well as the defects of similar compilations, were taken into consideration. As the foundation of all Science, and the acquisition of all knowledge, depend upon a just conception of the proper meaning of WORDS, it was considered as the most essential requisite of an UNIVERSAL DICTIONARY OF KNOWLEDGE, that it should contain an accurate definition and illustration of EVERY word in the English Language, in all its various senses. In following out this idea, Dr JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY appeared to be the most correct standard that could be adopted: but it was soon discovered, that however complete when published, that Work was deficient in many WORDS since introduced into our language by the best authors. It was also necessary to insert various words which, though now obsolete, are sanctioned by Chaucer, Spenser, and the other classical writers. The Doctor's accents were omitted, on account of the uncertainty and fluctuation of Pronunciation, in all living languages.\\n\\nAs the ARTS and SCIENCES, properly so called, are far from comprehending every necessary subject of inquiry, a considerable proportion of the work is allotted to HISTORY, BIOGRAPHY and GEOGRAPHY, in all their branches; so that the Compiler flatters himself, that it will be found upon consultation, that there is not a word in the English Language; a technical term in any Art or Science, an event of any importance in the history of mankind; a city, town, kingdom, republic, or empire, in the Known World; an opinion in Religion; an article in Mythology; a system of Philosophy; or a great or learned character in the annals of Biography, that is not mentioned or described in the Encyclopaedia Perthesis.\\n\\nOn the strength of such assertions, the Proprietors have been so bold as to denominate their Work an UNIVERSAL DICTIONARY OF KNOWLEDGE. It has indeed been intended to supersede the use of all Books of Reference by that of the ENCYCLOPAEDIA PERTHENSIS alone, and the Proprietors trust, the Compiler has been successful.\\n\\nMuch original matter has been furnished from a variety of quarters. The names of the contributors, where not prohibited to be published, are announced, with the proper thanks: but the merit of the Compilation of the whole, as well as the contribution of much original matter, belongs to Mr ALEXANDER AITCHISON, Member of the Royal Physical, and other Societies, of Edinburgh.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "End-Time Illusion", "body": "End-Time Illusion (E-TI) is a 21st century heavy metal band formed in 2002 who set out to perform sick sets filled with killer riffs, searing solos, and mass head banging. The E-TI sound encompasses thrash, grind, death, and speed laced with harmonies, breakdowns, and obscure scales.Founding members are Dave Sharpe (ex- Lachrymator, HellYouSinNation, :Blood Has Been Shed), Jay Warziniac (ex- Excoriate), and Sean Gaura (ex- End of Flesh). Jay Rodriquez was recruited for bass guitar shortly after. Starting out with a somewhat commercial metal sound the band quickly released a 3 song demo recorded by producer Zeus (Shadows Fall, Hatebreed, Agnostic Front). The demo fared well among reviewers and was well played on the :WAAF (FM) (Boston) show Harder-Faster. The band soon became tired of comparisons to metal-core bands and decided to go back to their roots and destroy via technical riff oriented metal. Close to completing enough new material to go into the studio at the end of 2003 Jay decided to move to Bulgaria. Realizing that finding a replacement on drums would be time consuming the band recorded the drum tracks before Jay’s departure. At this time Jayrod left the band. While continuing tracking at Zing studios in Westfield MA. Jay returned from his trip abroad to rejoin the band in early 2004.\\n\\nWith the addition of Scott Kadish (ex- End of Flesh) on second guitar and Gary Goudreau (ex- Excoriate) on bass the band released their first full length So Below through Spare Change Records in 2005. The CD received rave reviews. Popular metal magazine :Metal Maniacs reviewer Dave Brenner praised the E-TI sound, as well as Dave Schalek of Live4Metal.com, and Dan Berry of The Hartford Advocate. The band promoted the recording through relentless regional gigging throughout the northeast of the United States culminating in an east coast 2007 tour. thumb.\\n\\nRecording for a sophomore release began in the spring of 2007. Unfortunately towards the end of the year, Jay tiring of the metal circuit and the band in general became unsure of his commitment to the band. Under a mutual agreement Jay left to pursue other musical endeavors. The fall of 2007 saw many tryouts for a new drummer when Dave’s brother Matt (ex- Disenchanter, Brain Gauge, Vexation, Taxidermist) decided to come out of “retirement” and join the fold. The chemistry was immediate and E-TI proceeded to hit the road. Mastering for the new album was once again completed by the legendary Jim Morris of :Morrisound Recording. The band toured the entire east coast once more in the summer of 2008.On June 21, 2008 Eminent Profane was released on Spare Change Records. According to a review on CD Baby by Bob Howard, the band mixes \"many important genres of metal and does so by not conforming to the in thing\". thumb.In late 2008 the band struck up an endorsement with Monson Guitars. Dave's custom \"Conjurer\" model was released in 2009 which encompasses Dave’s personal design and specifications crafted by luthier Brent Monson. thumb.In August 2009 the band embarked on the successful “Profane Domains” Midwest headlining club tour.

{"title": "End Game (The X-Files)", "body": "End Game is a 1995 episode of The X-Files television series. It was the seventeenth episode broadcast in the show's second season. End Game continues from the previous episode \"Colony\", and includes Mulder's pursuit and confrontation with the Alien Bounty Hunter who has captured Scully.\\n\\nU.S.S. Allegiance, a nuclear submarine patrolling the Beaufort Sea off the coast of Alaska, comes across a craft below the ice that is emitting a radio signal. The Allegiance is ordered to fire upon the craft by Pacific Command. However, the craft manages to disable the sub, stranding it far below the ice. \\n\\nIn her hotel room in Maryland, Scully confronts \"Mulder\", who is really the Bounty Hunter in disguise. Scully pulls a gun on the Bounty Hunter, but he beats and kidnaps her. When Mulder and Samantha find the wrecked hotel room, she explains that the Bounty Hunter is using Scully as bait, and that he will set up a hostage exchange to swap Scully for her. She further explains that the Bounty Hunter can only be killed by piercing the back of his neck, and that his toxic alien blood is deadly to humans. Finally, Samantha reveals that the Gregors are the progeny of two original aliens, and worked at abortion clinics to gain access to fetal tissue. Their objective was to set up an extraterrestrial colony on Earth, an effort that has gone as far back as the 1940s. However, because the Gregors' experiments were not sanctioned and were considered to have tainted their alien race, the Bounty Hunter was sent to kill them.\\n\\nSkinner meets Mulder and Samantha at his apartment, telling them that the remaining Gregors are missing. Mulder is called by Scully, who tells him that the Bounty Hunter seeks an exchange for Samantha. Mulder and Samantha are sent to a bridge near Bethesda, while Skinner hides nearby with a sharpshooter. After the exchange takes place, Samantha attacks the Bounty Hunter. During the struggle, the sharpshooter fires upon the Bounty Hunter, and both he and Samantha fall into a river. An anguished Mulder tearfully apologizes to his father, Bill, for losing her again. Bill leaves a note by Samantha, which provides Mulder with a clinic address to head to if they are separated. Mulder hopes that she is alive, but soon in gets a call from Scully. She says him that Samantha's body has been found. After Scully ends the call, she discovers Samantha's body corroding into a green liquid.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Mulder steps into the clinic, where he finds multiple clones of Samantha working on fetuses in labs similar to that of the Gregors. They reveal that they manipulated Mulder by sending one of their own to pose as \"Samantha\", in an effort to have him protect her original clone. They also claim to know the real Samantha's location. Mulder, realizing he has been duped, initially refuses to help and attempts to leave. However, he is forced to face the Bounty Hunter when he arrives. The Bounty Hunter knocks Mulder unconscious, proceeding to kill the Samantha clones and burn down the clinic. When no trace of the clones are found, Mulder meets with X at the Kennedy Center, demanding to know the location of the Bounty Hunter. X says that the Bounty Hunter's craft below the Beaufort Sea has been found, and that a naval fleet has been sent to destroy it. Mulder heads there, but e-mails Scully to tell her not to follow him. \\n\\nScully goes to Skinner for help, but he initially refuses. Scully also brings X to Mulder's apartment, but he also refuses to provide her with information. On his way out, X is confronted by Skinner in an elevator. After the two men get into a vicious physical altercation, X divulges Mulder's whereabouts to Skinner. Scully heads out to find him. Meanwhile, Mulder finds the stranded Allegiance, with its sail broken through a patch of shallow ice. Inside, he finds that the sub's crew have all been killed. He comes across the apparent sole survivor, whom Mulder correctly guesses to be the disguised Bounty Hunter. He handcuffs him and places him at gunpoint, demanding to know where Samantha is. The two get into a struggle, during which he becomes exposed to the Bounty Hunter's blood. The Bounty Hunter claims that Samantha is still alive before dumping Mulder off the sail. He then submerges the Allegiance, nearly cutting Mulder in half with the sub's diving plane in the process. Mulder is rushed to the field hospital seen at the beginning of \"Colony\", where Scully -- having learned that the alien blood contains a retrovirus that dies in cold temperatures -- convinces the doctors to keep him in an ice tub, saving his life.\\n\\nAs Mulder's condition stabilizes, Scully writes a field report crediting science with detecting the retrovirus and saving Mulder's life. She contends that the retrovirus is of a mysterious origin, and reports that neither the Bounty Hunter nor the Allegiance have been found. When Mulder gains consciousness, he tells Scully that his experiences didn't give him the answers he had been searching for, but that they have given him renewed \"faith to keep looking\".\\n\\nThis was the first episode ever written by Frank Spotnitz. Spotnitz, who came up with the idea to bring back Samantha Mulder in the previous episode wrote this episode, his first credited work on the show. His original draft features two scenes cut out due to time, including Mulder having a confrontation with the federal marshal from the previous episode, and Mulder finding his sister on the road after the hostage trade only for her to end up being the Alien Bounty Hunter. According to Spotnitz, he along with Chris Carter were insanely ambitious when writing this episode. Since this was Spotnitz's debut as a television writer, he got significant help from Carter to put the script together. All of the scenes originally pitched by Spotnitz were kept with the exception of a car chase scene that ended with a \"crash\". After shooting and creating the episode, the production crew asked for a higher budget to support the series.\\n\\nIt turned out in this episode that the Samantha Mulder (Megan Leitch) who appeared was a clone. Carter didn't want it to be the real Samantha since that would have been \"straight science fiction\" and it was too \"ridiculous\" to give too many answers. Spotnitz further explained that the production crew never saw The X-Files as a \"science fiction show\", but more of a show that incorporated science fiction and that this and previous episode \"Colony\" were more of a \"suspense thriller\" than anything else.\\n\\nThe motel scene with the Alien Bounty Hunter and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) was shot on a sound stage in Vancouver, Canada in a simple motel room set. The scene featuring Scully being beaten up by the Alien Bounty Hunter wasn't acted by Anderson, but a stunt woman. That \"uh\" Scully utters when pushed to the ground was insisted on by Standards and Practices, giving the reasoning that the show needed to make it clear for the viewers that she was not dead. According to Spotnitz it was an \"arcane, bizarre logic that you have to deal with when you're putting a show on network television.\" \\n\\nOne hundred forty tons of snow and ice were trucked into a soundstage in order to create the scene with the submarine towards the end of the episode. A Canadian destroyer, the Her Majesty's Canadian Ship Mackenzie was used for the submarine interior, and was reused two episodes later for the episode \"Død Kalm\".\\n\\nThis episode earned a Neilsen rating of 11.2, with a 19 share and was viewed by 10.7 million households.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Endless Mountains", "body": "300pxThe Endless Mountains are a chain of mountains in northeastern Pennsylvania. The Endless Mountains region includes Bradford, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Northern Wayne, and Wyoming Counties. \\n\\nleftPart of the Appalachian Mountains chain, the region does not consist of true mountains, geologically speaking, but instead a dissected plateau that is part of the Allegheny Plateau. The Catskill Mountains are the highest expression of the plateau, located to the east of the Endless Mountains, and separated from them by the Delaware River. \\n\\nThe current geography was slightly modified during the last ice age by the Wisconsin Glacier about 15,000 years ago. Glacial striation can be found on the rocks of some of the high ridges, but the area was at the margin of the ice sheet, and the impact was much less than in New York just to the north.\\n\\nThe \"mountains\" are made up of sedimentary rock (mostly sandstone and shale, with a little conglomerate) that were part of a lowland that collected sediments eroded from mountains to the southeast in Mississippian and Pennsylvanian geologic time. The area has been uplifted and lowered several times. The highest points are all nearly the same elevation, establishing that the area had once been eroded into a nearly level peneplane, which has since been uplifted. The present Susquehanna River established its meander course during that time, when it was a mature stream on a topography of very low relief. When the area was uplifted, the river's bends were preserved as incised meander. The large river cut a deep valley and established a low baseline for its tributaries, which then cut the plateau into the rugged hills of the present day.\\n\\nNative American bands settled the area in prehistoric times. By the early colonial period, Susquehannock and Iroquois were the principal occupants of the region. The majority of the local place names were derived from the Native Americans. The native groups were driven out by the late colonial period and white settlement began. Many settlers came from Connecticut leading to armed conflict with settlers from Pennsylvania (See Pennamite Wars). During the American Revolution in 1778, a combined Native American and British force attacked the Wyoming Valley settlers on the eastern edge of this region, and killed many of the settlers. Washington sent general John Sullivan on a campaign to destroy the Native American threat by a \"scorched earth\" drive up the Susquehanna and Chemung River into central and western New York.\\n\\nThe region's economy was formerly based on mining, lumbering (especially of hemlock for tanning) and industry but is now largely agricultural with forestry and tourism contributing to the economic base. Much of the land is steep, but there are a few good farms on rolling hilltops or valley bottoms; many of these farms have been occupied by Mennonite and Amish people who have migrated northward as their traditional homelands became developed. \\n\\nQuarry remains an important local industry with the region's high quality Blue stone being particularly valuable. The area is on the edge of Pennsylvania's Coal Region, with some minor veins of coal extending into the area.\\n\\nSongwriter Stephen Foster lived in the area for a while, and Bradford County's Camptown is immortalized in his song Camptown Races. \\n\\n"}

They are different from energy drink, which contain caffeine, whereas bars provide food energy. These bars have varying names in different locations, including cereal bar, oat bar, snack bar, granola bar, muesli bar, and breakfast bar.\\n\\nThe first energy bar in the American marketplace was Space Food Sticks which Pillsbury Company created in the late 1960s to capitalize on the popularity of the space program. Space Food Sticks were developed by Robert Muller, the inventor of the HACCP standards used by the food industry to insure food safety. They are currently being made by Retrofuture Products in Port Washington, New York.\\n\\nEnergy bars, like all food, supply the body with physical energy, as measured in Calorie or joule. Energy drinks, by contrast, are intended to improve mental energy by stimulating the central nervous system, usually with moderate to large doses of caffeine or other stimulants, though many also supply physical energy in the form of sugar. Both energy bars and energy drinks may contain added vitamin.\\n\\nEnergy in food comes from three main sources: fat, protein, and carbohydrate. A typical energy bar will supply about , 3–9 g of fat, 7–15 g of protein, and 20–40 g of carbohydrates.\\n\\nDietary fiber is often added to energy bars to add bulk without calories and slow the absorption of glucose. Insoluble fiber, like that found in whole grain wheat, does not do this. Many companies have started using it in energy bars to give consumers the feeling of satiety.\\n\\nMany people over-indulge in carbohydrates, which can cause weight gain. When too many carbohydrates are eaten, the liver fills with glycogen and still has glucose entering it. The liver will then store the excess glucose as fat, for later use. This is one reason why energy bars work better for athletes and people with active lifestyles.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Energy policy of Russia", "body": "The Energy policy of Russia is contained in an Energy Strategy document, which sets out policy for the period up to 2020. In 2000 the Russian government approved the main provisions of the Russian energy strategy to 2020, and in 2003 the new Russian energy strategy was confirmed by the government. The Energy Strategy document outlines several main priorities: an increase in energy efficiency, reducing impact on the environment, sustainable development, energy development and technological development, as well as improved effectiveness and competitiveness.\\n\\nRussia, one of the world's two energy superpower, is rich in natural energy resources. It has the largest known natural gas reserves of any state on earth, along with the second largest coal reserves, and the eighth largest oil reserves. Russia is the world's fourth largest electricity producer after the USA, China, and Japan. Russia exports 70% of oil produced, making it the world's leading net energy exporter as well as a major supplier to the European Union.\\n\\nRenewable energy in Russia is largely undeveloped although there is considerable potential for renewable energy use. Geothermal energy, which is used for heating and electricity production in some regions of the Northern Caucasus and the Far East, is the most developed renewable energy source in Russia.\\n\\nOn July 2008 Russia's president signed a law allowing the government to allocate strategic oil and gas deposits on the continental shelf without an auction procedure.\\n\\nThe idea of a Russian national energy policy was approved by the government of Russia in 1992. At the same time government decided to develop the Energy Strategy of Russia. For this purpose the Interagency Commission was established.\\n\\nIn December 1994, the Energy Strategy of Russia (Major Provisions) was approved by the government, followed by the presidential decree from 7 May 1995 confirming the first post-Soviet Russian energy strategy On the Main Directions of Energy Policy and Restructuring of the Fuel and Energy Industry of the Russian Federation for the Period up to the Year 2010, and the governmental decision from the 13 October 1995 approving the Main provisions for the Energy Strategy of the Russian Federation.\\n\\nThe strategy was changed under the presidency of Vladimir Putin. On 23 November 2000, the Russian government approved main provisions of the Russian energy strategy to 2020. On 28 May 2002, the Russian Ministry of Energy gave an elaboration on the main provisions. Based on these documents, the new Russian energy strategy up to 2020 was approved on 23 May 2003 and confirmed by the government on 28 August 2003.\\n\\nThe main objective of Russian energy strategy is defined to be the determination of ways of reaching a better quality of fuel and energy mix and enhancing the competitive ability of Russian energy production and services in the world market. For this purpose the long-term energy policy should concentrate on energy safety, energy effectiveness, budget effectiveness and ecological energy security.\\n\\nThe energy strategy document defines the main priority of Russian energy strategy as an increase in energy efficiency (meaning decreasing of energy intensity in production and energy supply expenditures), reducing impact on the environment, sustainable development, energy development and technological development, as well as an improvement of effectiveness and competitiveness.\\n\\nRussia is rich in energy resources. Russia has the largest known natural gas reserves of any state on earth, along with the second largest coal reserves, and the eighth largest oil reserves. This is 32% of world proven natural gas reserves (23% of the probable reserves), 12% of the proven oil reserves (42% of the probable reserves), 10% of the explored coal reserves (14% of the estimated reserves) and 8% of the proven uranium reserves.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumbIn recent years Russia has identified the gas sector as being of key strategic importance. The share of natural gas as a primary energy source is remarkably high compared to the rest of world. Russia has the world biggest natural gas reserves, mainly owned and operated by the Russian monopoly Gazprom, which produces 94% of Russia's natural gas production. In global context Gazprom holds 25% of the world's known gas reserves and produces of 16% of global output. In 2006, Russia was the world's biggest natural gas producer with 22.0% of global natural gas production and also the biggest exporter with 22.9% of global natural gas export.\\n\\nGazprom has a monopoly for the natural gas pipelines and has exclusive right to export natural gas, granted by the Federal Law \"On Gas Export\", which came into force on 20 July 2006. Gazprom also has control over all gas pipelines leading out of Central Asia, and thus controls their access to the Europe market. Russia has used Central Asia's gas, primarily that from Turkmenistan, on occasions where it has found itself unable to meet all its delivery obligations from its own production. Such circumstances in 2000 led to Gazprom allowing Turkmenistan to use its pipelines to supply gas to the Russian domestic market leaving Gazprom free to fulfil its obligations towards European customers. Other main natural gas producers in Russia are gas companies Novatek, Itera, Northgas and Rospan, and vertically integrated oil companies Surgutneftegaz, TNK-BP, Rosneft and LUKOIL.\\n\\nThe main export markets of Russian natural gas are the European Union and the CIS. Russia supplies a quarter of the EU gas consumption, mainly via transit trough Ukraine (Soyuz, Brotherhood) and Belarus (Yamal-Europe pipeline). The main importers are Germany (where links were developed as a result of Germany's Ostpolitik during the 1970s, and also Ukraine, Belarus, Italy, Turkey, France and Hungary.\\n\\nIn September 2009, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Russia would try to liberalize the domestic gas market in the near future but would maintain Gazprom's export monopoly in the medium term.\\n\\nRussia is the largest oil producer in the non-OPEC countries, and second biggest in the world after Saudi Arabia, which it overtakes as the world's number one from time to time. In 2006, Russia contributed 12.1 % of global oil production and 11.6 % of global oil exports. In June 2006, Russian crude oil and condensate production reached the post-Soviet maximum of 9.7 million barrels per day (b/d), exceeding production in 2000 by 3.2 million b/d. Russian export consists more than 5 million b/d of oil and nearly 2 million b/d of refined products, which go mainly to the European market. The domestic demand in 2005 was 2.6 million b/d on average. Russia is also the main transit country for oil from Kazakhstan.\\n\\nThe biggest Russian oil company is Rosneft followed by Lukoil, TNK-BP, Surgutneftegaz, Gazprom Neft and Tatneft. All oil trunk pipelines (except the Caspian Pipeline Consortium) are owned and operated by the state-owned monopoly Transneft; oil products pipelines are owned and operated by its subsidiary Transnefteproduct. Currently, Transneft is constructing the Eastern Siberia – Pacific Ocean oil pipeline that would bring Russian oil to the Asian-Pacific markets (China, Japan, Korea).\\n\\nAs the Arctic ice cap shrinks due to global warming, the prospect of oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean is thought to be an increasing possibility. On December 20, 2001, Russia submitted documents to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf claiming expanded limits to Russian continental shelf beyond the previous 200 mile zone within the Russian Arctic sector. In 2002 the UN Commission recommended that Russia should carry out additional research, which commenced in 2007. It is thought that the area may contain 10bn tonnes of gas and oil deposits.\\n\\nRussia has the world’s second largest coal reserves, with 157 billion tonnes of reserves.\\n\\nRussian coal reserves are widely dispersed. The principal hard coal deposits are located in the Pechora and Kuznetsk basins. The Kansk-Achinsk basin contains huge deposits of brown coal. The Siberian Lena and Tunguska basins constitute largely unexplored resources, the commercial exploitation of which would probably be difficult.\\n\\nRussia owns the biggest oil shale reserves in Europe equal to 35.47 billion tonnes of shale oil. More than 80 oil shale deposits have been identified. Main deposits are located in the Volga-Petchyorsk province and the Baltic Basin. Extraction of the deposits in the Volga-Petchyorsk province began in the 1930s, but was abandoned due to environmental problems. Main oil shale industry was concentrated on the Baltic Basin in Slantsy, but at the end of the 1990s the Slantsy oil shale processing plant and oil shale-fired power station were converted to use traditional hydrocarbons and mining activities ceased before 2005. In Syzran a small processing plant continues to operate.\\n\\nSmall extra-heavy oil reserves have been identified in the Volga-Urals and North Caucasus-Mangyshlak basins. Large deposits of natural bitumen are located in Eastern Siberia in the Lena-Tunguska basin. Other bitumen deposits are located in the Timan-Pechora and Volga-Urals Basins, and in Tatarstan. In September 2007, Tatneft and Royal Dutch Shell announced a strategic partnership to develop heavy crude oil production in Tatarstan, where Tatneft already has pilot production of bitumen.\\n\\nUranium exploration and development activities have been largely concentrated on three east-of-Urals uranium districts (Transural, West Siberia and Vitim). The most important uranium producing area has been the Streltsovsky region near Krasnokamensk in the Chitinskaya Oblast. In 2005, the Russian Federation was the world’s fourth largest producer of uranium, accounting for 8.2% of global output.\\n\\nthumbRussia is the world's fourth largest electricity producer after the USA, China, and Japan. In 2005, Russia produced 951 TWh and exported 23 TWh of electricity. Roughly 63% of Russia's electricity is generated by thermal plants, 21% by hydropower and 16% comes from nuclear reactor. Russia exports electricity to the CIS countries, Latvia, Lithuania, China, Poland, Turkey and Finland.\\n\\nThe Russian energy market is dominated by the Unified Energy System. While production and sale will be opened up to competition, transmission and distribution remain under state control.\\n\\nIn recent years there were several blackouts, notably the 2005 Moscow power blackouts.\\n\\nGross theoretical potential of the Russian hydro resource base is 2,295 TWh per year, of which 852 TWh is regarded as economically feasible. Most of this potential is located in Siberia and the Far East. Hydro generation (including pumped-storage output) in 2005 was 175 TWh, which represents 5.8% of world hydroelectricity generation. Russia ranks as the fifth largest hydroelectricity producer in the world. At the end of 2005 installed hydroelectric generating capacity was 45.7 GW.\\n\\nIn 2005 nuclear energy supply in Russia amounted to 149 TWh, which is 15.7 % of total Russian electricity output and 5.4 % of global nuclear energy production. The total installed capacity of nuclear reactors is 21,244MW. There are plans to increase the number of commercial reactors from thirty one to fifty nine.\\n\\nFrom 2001 all Russian civil reactors were operated by Energoatom. On 19 January 2007 Russian Parliament adopted legislation which created Atomenergoprom - a holding company for all Russian civil nuclear industry, including Energoatom, the nuclear fuel producer and supplier TVEL, the uranium trader Tekhsnabexport (Tenex) and nuclear facilities constructor Atomstroyexport.\\n\\nRenewable energy in Russia is largely undeveloped although Russia has many potential renewable energy resources.\\n\\nGeothermal energy, which is used for heating and electricity production in some regions of the Northern Caucasus and the Far East, is the most developed renewable energy source in Russia. Geothermal resources have been identified in the Northern Caucasus, Western Siberia, Lake Baikal, and in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands. In 1966 a 4 MWe single-flash plant was commissioned at Pauzhetka (currently 11 MWe) followed by a 12 MWe geothermal power plant at Verkhne Mutnovsky, and 50 MWe Mutnovsky geothermal power plant. At the end of 2005 installed capacity for direct use amounted to more than 307 MWt.\\n\\nPrincipal peat deposits are located in the north-western parts of Russia, in West Siberia, near the western coast of Kamchatka and in several other far-eastern regions. The Siberian peatlands account for nearly 75 % of Russia's total reserves of 186 billion tonnes, second only to Canada’s. Approximately 5 % of exploitable peat (1.5 million tonnes per annum) is used for fuel production. Although peat was used as industrial fuel for power generation in Russia for a long period, its share has been in long-term decline, and since 1980 has amounted to less than 1 %.\\n\\nIt has been estimated that Russia's gross potential for solar energy is 2.3 trillion tce. The regions with the best solar radiation potential are the North Caucasus, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea areas, and southern parts of Siberia and the Far East. This potential is largely unused, although the possibilities for off-grid solar energy or hybrid applications in remote areas are huge. However, the construction of a single solar power plant Kislovodskaya SPP (1.5 MW) has been delayed.\\n\\nRussia has high quality wind resources on the Pacific and Arctic coasts and in vast steppe and mountain areas. Large-scale wind energy systems are suitable in Siberia and the Far East (east of Sakhalin Island, the south of Kamchatka, the Chukotka Peninsula, Vladivostok), the steppes along the Volga river, the northern Caucasus steppes and mountains and on the Kola Peninsula, where power infrastructure and major industrial consumers are in place. At the end of 2006, total installed wind capacity was 15 MW. Major wind power stations operate at Kalmytskaya (2 MW), Zapolyarnaya (1.5 MW), Kulikovskaya (5.1 MW), Tyupkildi (2.2 MW) and Observation Cape (2.5 MW). Feasibility studies are being carried out on the Kaliningradskaya (50 MW) and the Leningradskaya (75 MW) wind farms. There are about 100 MW of wind projects in Kalmykia and in Krasnodar Krai.\\n\\nA small pilot tidal power plant with a capacity of 400 kW was constructed at Kislaya Guba near Murmansk in 1968. In 2007, Gidro OGK, a subsidiary of the Unified Energy System (UES) began the installation of a 1.5 MW experimental orthogonal turbine at Kislaya Guba. If it proves successful, UES plans to continue with Mezen Bay (15,000 MW) and Tugur Bay (7,980 MW) projects.\\n\\nVladimir Putin approved the Kyoto Protocol on November 4, 2004 and Russia officially notified the United Nations of its ratification on November 18, 2004. The issue of Russian ratification was particularly closely watched in the international community, as the accord was brought into force 90 days after Russian ratification (February 16, 2005).\\n\\nPresident Putin had earlier decided in favour of the protocol in September 2004, along with the Russian cabinet, against the opinion of the Russian Academy of Sciences, of the Ministry for Industry and Energy and of the then president's economic advisor, Andrey Illarionov, and in exchange to EU's support for the Russia's admission in the WTO. As anticipated after this, ratification by the lower (October 22, 2004) and upper house of parliament did not encounter any obstacles.\\n\\nThe Kyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from their 1990 levels. Russia did not face mandatory cuts since its greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Because of this, despite its growing economy, by 2012 Russia will by no means exceed the level of emissions in 1990, which is the Kyoto Protocol's year of departure.\\n\\nIt is debatable whether Russia will benefit from selling emissions credits to other countries in the Kyoto Protocol, although Gazprom has already entered the market. \"Russia is the Saudi Arabia of carbon [carbon emissions credits],\" said its representative. \"There is a tremendous bank there\".\\n\\nIn terms of the Russian energy demand structure, domestic production greatly exceeds domestic demand, making Russia the world’s leading net energy exporter.\\n\\nRussia's energy superpower status has recently become a hot topic in the European Union. Russia's overwhelmingly large reserves of natural gas have helped give it the title without much debate.\\n\\nRussia has recently been accused in the West (i.e. Europe and the United States) of using its natural resources as a policy tool to be wielded against offending states like Georgia, Ukraine, and other states it perceives as hindrances to its power. According to one estimate, since 1991 there were more than 55 energy incidents, of which more than 30 had political underpinnings. Only 11 incidents had no political connections. On the other hand, Russian officials like to remind their Western partners that even at the height of the Cold War the Soviet Union never disrupted energy supplies to the West.\\n\\nRussia, in turn, accuses the West of applying double-standards relating to market principles, pointing out that it has been supplying gas to the states in question at prices that were significantly below world market levels, and in some cases remain so even after the increases. Russia argues that it is not obligated to effectively subsidize the economies of post-Soviet states by offering them resources at below-market prices.\\n\\nStarting January 1, 2007 Gazprom increased the price of natural gas for Azerbaijan to 235 USD per thousand cubic metre. Azerbaijan refused to pay this price and the gas export to Azerbaijan stopped. On its side, Azerbaijan stopped oil export to and via Russia. A year earlier, pro-Russian Armenia was hit with the same 100% price hike as Western-oriented Georgia, Vladimir Socor has observed.\\n\\nThe Russia-Belarus energy dispute began when Russia state-owned gas supplier Gazprom demanded an increase in gas prices paid by Belarus, which has been closely allied with Moscow and forms a loose union state with Russia. It escalated on January 8, 2007, when the Russian state-owned pipeline company Transneft stopped pumping oil into the Druzhba pipeline which runs through Belarus.Transneft has accused Belarus of forcing the shutdown by stealing oil from the pipeline and halted the oil transport.On January 10, Transneft resumed oil exports through the pipeline after Belarus ended the tariff that sparked the shutdown, despite differing messages from the parties on the state of negotiations.\\n\\nOn 9 July 2008, after signing an agreement between the United States and the Czech Republic to host a tracking radar for an antiballistic missile system, the flow of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline to the Czech Republic started to reduce. Although officially the linkage between reduction of oil supplies and the radar agreement was not claimed, it was suspected. Transneft denied any connections with radar agreement, saying that reduction was purely commercial as Tatneft and Bashneft started to refine more oil at their own refineries. Although Prime Minister Putin asked Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin to 'work with all partners to make sure there are no disruptions', in reality the supplies were reduced to 50%.\\n\\nIn the January 2006 alleged North Ossetia sabotage, two simultaneous explosions occurred on the main branch and a reserve branch of the Mozdok-Tbilisi pipeline in the Russian border region of North Ossetia. The electricity transmission line in Russia's southern region of Karachayevo-Cherkessiya near the Georgian border was brought down by an explosion just hours later. Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili blamed Russia for putting pressure on Georgia's energy system at the time of the coldest weather.\\n\\nOn November 1, 2006 Gazprom announced that it will construct a direct gas pipeline to Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia. The work on the pipeline started just before South Ossetia's November 12 referendum on separating from Georgia.Starting January 1, 2007 Gazprom increased natural gas prices to Georgia following an international incident in an alleged effort to strongly influence the Georgian leadership's defiance of Moscow. The current price is 235 USD per thousand cubic metre, which is the highest among the CIS countries.\\n\\nThe August 2008 military conflict between Georgia and Russia over the autonomous region of South Ossetia, which has been de-facto independent from Georgia since the early 1990s, is likely to shift the balance of power between the main players involved in the formation of the future of the Caspian and Central Asian energy sector, including:\\n\\n• Producer and transit countries: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Turkey and Iran;\\n\\n• Foreign corporations operating in the region's hydrocarbon sector;\\n\\n• Major external players: China, Russia, the European Union and the United States.\\n\\nThe volatility of these transit routes is likely to shape investment decisions of international oil companies involved in the development of Central Asian and Caspian hydrocarbons and their transportation to global markets. Governments of these resource rich countries are bound to have serious concerns about the safety of BTC, WREP and BTE pipelines, the railway networks and the oil terminals at the Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi, Kulevi and Poti, all of which were halted by the Georgian-Russian hostilities. Although, the pipelines were only temporarily shut down for security reasons and were not targeted or damaged in the conflict, their future expansion and the construction of related new pipeline projects, such as the Kazakh-Caspian Transportation System, the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline and Nabucco are now uncertain. In this situation, Central Asian and Caspian producers may opt for traditional exports via Russia (providing Moscow successfully expands the capacity of its oil and gas export routes) and the new export pipelines to China.\\n\\nOn July 29, 2006 Russia shut down oil export to Mažeikių oil refinery in Lithuania after an oil spill on the Druzhba pipeline system occurred in Russia’s Bryansk oblast, near the point where a line to Belarus and Lithuania branches off the main export pipeline. Transneft said it would need one year and nine months to repair the damaged section. Although Russia cited technical reasons for stopping oil deliveries to Lithuania, Lithuania claims that the oil supply was stopped because Lithuania sold the Mažeikių refinery to Polish company PKN Orlen in an effort to avoid the refinery and infrastructure being bought out by Russian interests. Russian crude oil is now being transshipped via the Būtingė Marine Terminal.\\n\\nThere has been rapprochement with Mr Tusk's government in Warsaw, after two years of tensions with the conservative government of Mr Kaczynski. The cooperation on the Yamal-Europe pipeline is continued without serious problems. Nevertheless, some disagreements concerning control of Yamal-Europe pipeline and transit pricing remain. Despite attempts to relive tensions, consecutive Polish governments strongly oppose the Nord Stream project bypassing Poland and favour further development of overland alternatives. It remains a contentious issue that as a result of Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute in 2009, Polish PGNIG gas company did not receive contracted supplies of Russian gas from Ukraine.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2006 Russia greatly increased the price of gas for Ukraine to bring it inline with market values. The dispute between Russian state-owned gas supplier Gazprom and Ukraine over natural gas prices started in March 2005 (over the price of natural gas and prices for the transition of Gazprom's gas to Europe). The two parties were unable to reach an agreement to resolve the dispute, and Russia cut gas exports to Ukraine on January 1, 2006 at 10:00 MSK. The supply was restored on January 4, when a preliminary agreement between two gas companies was settled. Other disputes arose in October 2007 and in January 2009, this dispute again resulted in 18 European countries reporting major falls or cut-offs of their gas supplies from Russia transported through Ukraine. Gas supplies restarted on 20 January 2009 and were fully restored on 21 January 2009.\\n\\nThe EU-Russia Energy Dialogue was launched at the EU-Russia Summit in Paris in October 2000. At the working level the Energy Dialogue consists three thematic working groups. The Energy Dialogue involves the EU Member States, energy industry and the international financial institutions.Projected gas pipelines originating in Russia and supplying Europe.\\n\\nRussia signed the Energy Charter Treaty in 1994, but flatly refused to ratify its current revision. Russia's main objections to the ratification revolve around the proviso about the third party access to the pipelines and transit fees. Notwithstanding the fact that Russia didn't ratify the treaty, Ivan Materov, State Secretary and Deputy Minister of Industry and Energy of the Russian Federation, serves as the vice-chairman of the Energy Charter Conference, and Andrei Konoplyanik as the Deputy Secretary General.\\n\\nRussia and the European Union have also failed to finalize the negotiations on the Energy Charter Protocol on Transit. The main issue remain open is how, and to what extent, the Protocol will include mechanisms for establishment long term transit arrangements. Also the third party access to its pipeline infrastructure has remained Russia's main objection to the Protocol.\\n\\nSwedish economist Anders Åslund, who has long experience in Russia, estimates that 50 percent of the state-owned Gazprom's investments are lost through corrupt practices. For instance, the Russian section of Blue Stream pipeline was three times more expensive to construct per kilometer than the Turkish section of the pipeline.\\n\\nExperts believe William Browder's \"visa problem\" is related to that he made questions about Gazprom's murky intermediates which receive money from Gazprom.\\n\\nThe Russian government and Russian energy companies were beneficiaries in the Oil-for-Food Programme.\\n\\nRussia\\n\\n"}

Previous to the model E8000ECC, Enfield developed a fiberglass and ABS plastic bodied electric passenger vehicle that was of unacceptable performance according to the Electricity Counsel. Following that, Enfield developed the model E8000ECC and subsequently was relocated to the Greek Island of Syros.\\n\\nThe Enfield 8000 was the predecessor to the E8000ECC. It was a 2 + 2 seater electric car with bucket seats in the front and bench seats in the back. The various versions of the E8000ECC were based on the Enfield's 8000 chasis, components and systems.\\n\\nBased on the Enfield 8000, the E8000ECC had passed all the necessary tests for production in the United Kingdom and was on its way to be produced in the United States of America. Then Governor of California Ronald Reagan sent a cargo plane to have three E8000ECCs moved to California in support of his Clean Air legislation. However, the E8000ECC was never produced in the United States. The unique aerodynamics of the E8000ECC were not based on traditional industry principles and ideas. They were based on designs made by Konstantine Adraktas the Chairman and Managing Technical Director of Enfield, who was a graduate of the Aerospace department at MIT and the creator of the mathematical equation for the trajectory of the Apollo flights to the moon.The car was eventually produced in Greece after the company was incorporated into Neorion (also owned by Mr. Goulandris) and renamed Enfield-Neorion.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Engineering, Science, and Management War Training", "body": "The Engineering, Science, and Management War Training program (ESMWT) was one of the largest and most productive educational activities in America's history. It was perhaps only second to the G.I. Bill (officially the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944) in its scope and productivity.\\n\\nSometimes referred to as an \"experiment in streamlined higher education\", this government-sponsored program provided, without charge, college-grade courses for large numbers of Americans to fill urgently needed technical and scientific civilian positions just prior to and during World War II. College-grade was officially defined as \"work of an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students.\"\\n\\nWith successive designations of Engineering Defense Training (EDT), Engineering, Science, and Management Defense Training (ESMDT), and ESMWT, the program was operated by the U.S. Office of Education from October 1940 through June 1945, with 215 colleges and universities providing about 60,000 courses for close to 2,500,000 students.\\n\\nIn mid-1940, before America officially entered World War II, it was brought to the attention of U.S. Congress that the civilian effort supporting the expected conflict would require far more engineers than were then available or could be produced through normal programs at colleges and universities. As part of the budget preparation, Congress tasked John W. Studebaker, then Commissioner of Education and heading the Office of Education (predecessor of the United States Department of Education), to develop a program to help alleviate this crisis.\\n\\nStudebaker asked Andrey A. Potter, Dean of Engineering at Purdue University, to assist in developing this program and in preparing a proposal to Congress. A National Advisory Committee – composed of academic leaders and industry officials – first met on September 20–21, 1940. On October 9, a bill authoring the Engineering Defense Training (EDT) program with initial funding of $9 million (equivalent to $138 million in 2008) was passed by Congress and quickly signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\n\\nThe bill authorized the Office of Education to contract with engineering schools throughout the U.S. to offer \"intensive courses of college grade, designed to meet the shortage of engineers in activities essential to national defense.\" Roy A. Seaton, Dean of Engineering at Kansas State College, was appointed to direct the program. Twenty-two regional advisors, each a prominent engineering educator, served without pay as coordinators. \\n\\nCourses under the EDT program began on December 9, 1940. During the remainder of the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1941, about 120,800 individuals enrolled in 2,260 courses offered by 144 institutions. \\n\\nIn July 1941, the Labor-Federal Security Appropriations Act, authorized the addition of chemistry, physics, and production-related courses to form an integrated ESMDT program. Funding was increased to $17.5 million ($270 million equivalent in 2008), and Dean George W. Case from the University of New Hampshire, replaced Seaton as the program director. During the next year, enrollment increased to nearly 450,000 men and women in about 7,800 courses offered by 196 colleges and universities. \\n\\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) and the entry of the U.S. into World War II, the War-Time Commission was formed within the Department of Education to be responsible for this and other special training activities. The program was again renamed, becoming ESMWT, and continued as such through June 1945. The annual enrollment in ESMWT averaged nearly 600,000 in some 13,000 courses. Ultimately, 215 colleges and universities participated, with the offerings given in more than 1,000 towns and cities.\\n\\nThe primary objective of the program was to prepare persons for professional positions in defense activities. The authorization required the courses to be of \"an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students\", distinguishing them from offerings of trade or technical schools. They were limited to engineering, physics, chemistry, and management subjects directly needed in defense activities\\n\\nIt is noted that many of the ESMWT courses, although of \"college grade\" at that time, might not be recognized as such in engineering and science programs today. At most colleges and universities in the early 1940s, engineering education greatly emphasized practical applications as opposed to theoretical analysis. It was somewhat the same in many undergraduate physics and chemistry programs.\\n\\nAlthough there might be progressively higher-level courses in a subject, each ESMWT course was to be complete in itself and designed to convey some stated, applicable knowledge set. While prerequisites were listed for courses, these were mainly to indicate the background needed to understand the subject matter, and the pursuit of a course was not limited to persons having these prerequisites.\\n\\nThe participating colleges and universities were fully responsible for determining the local needs and developing courses to meet these needs. The relationship of these courses to the regular courses in a degree program was also under the responsibility of the offering institution.\\n\\nRegular faculty members taught most of the courses. Although requiring considerable preparation, this was welcome work for most professors; between the draft and volunteering, college enrollment was a small fraction of normal. Some courses required instructors to have a highly specialized knowledge, and practitioners from industry were then used.\\n\\nThe matter of granting academic course credit for the special courses was an issue from the beginning. The Office of Education recommended against academic credit, reasioning that since the courses were paid by the government, this might \"constitute a Federal subsidy to the participating college\", a forbidden practice in that day. It was recommended, however, that knowledge of a subject gained through these courses be recognized, by examination or otherwise, for students in regular college programs, allowing them to excused from that subject, with or without credit. \\n\\nThe Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD), then the accrediting body for engineering programs and predecessor of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), also had reservations concerning academic credit. Following much debate, it was left to each school to make any credit-related decisions and, in the end, most decided against directly granting academic credit, primarily citing the imbalance of applications over theory in most ESMWT courses.\\n\\nAfter being prepared by the offering institution, course outlines, schedules, and other information were submitted to the ESMWT Washington staff for approval, and the cognizant school was required to permanently maintain the same type of records on presented courses as those kept in regular academic programs.\\n\\nBy law, admission to ESMWT courses was open to students without regard to age, sex, or race. With this, and without enforcement of prerequisites, there was a great diversity of students in the various offerings. It was not uncommon to find students in their early teens using the ESMWT program to accelerate their entry into engineering and science jobs. On the other end of the age spectrum, many of the students were in mid-life, preparing for a change of work field or refreshing their earlier education.\\n\\nPerhaps the greatest diversity was in the number of female students. Prior to the 1940s, there were few women working in industry science and even less in engineering. The entry of women into defense jobs is well known through \"Rosie the Riveter\", but those in wartime engineering and related work are not often recognized; however, thousands entered professional work after being prepared through this program.\\n\\nUnder the initial EDT, women constituted less than 1 percent. With the addition of science and management courses, there were about 9 percent under ESMDT. After the start of the war and ESMWT, the numbers participating in the program increased to 22 percent. Many engineering schools that had earlier been all-male, first accepted women when they began the program. Conversely, a number of previously female colleges – including Bryn Mawr College, Skidmore College, and Wellesley College – participated in the program and had their first male students. (Some of these schools later reverted to all-female).\\n\\nThroughout the program, about 75 percent of the enrollments were in engineering subjects. After a series of courses in a particular subject area, many of the students, especially those having an earlier background in science and/or mathematics, were placed in regular engineering positions with industry or government agencies. These were sometimes referred to as \"instant engineers.\" A 1950 survey of practicing engineers found that there were many more than the sum of those in 1940 plus those graduating from engineering colleges in the 1940-50 decade; much of this difference was attributed to persons who gained this classification through the ESMWT program.\\n\\nMany schools considered graduation from ESMWT courses to have great significance. As an example, at North Carolina State University the Chancellor often personally awarded certificates to the graduates. \\n\\nThe Office of Education requirements were that students of any race would be admitted to ESMDT courses. Unfortunately, African-Americans were not well represented either in the participating institutions or as students. Howard University did have a relatively large program for the District of Columbia area; this was led by Herman R. Branson of the Physics Department who had a distinguished post-war career in academia.\\n\\nFrom June 23 to August 29, 1941, electrical engineering student J. Presper Eckert assisted in teaching a 10-week ESMDT course in electronics at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering. The course had 30 students, 16 of whom held Ph.D. degrees. Among the students was John W. Mauchly. Eckert and Mauchly then teamed in developing the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), America's first large-scale digital computer.\\n\\nCourses in industrial chemistry and metallurgy were in great demand. Harry J. Sweeney, then Chief Metallurgist for the giant Republic Steel, stated, \"I don’t know what we would have done without the ESMDT courses; about 75 percent of our new professionals were trained through this program.\"\\n\\nAircraft played a vital role in World War II. During 1940, Cornell University started courses in aircraft structures and stress analysis at Buffalo, New York, for Bell Aircraft and Curtis Wright. One of these, starting December 9, was the first EDT-sponsored course in the U.S. By the end of the first year, more than 800 students were attending these classes.\\n\\nIn 1941, the University of Texas started a series of ESMDT courses in aeronautical engineering. These were so successful that the next year a full Department of Aeronautical Engineering was formed. For the aircraft industries of Los Angeles, Maurice J. Zucrow of University of California, Los Angeles, taught ESMWT courses on jet propulsion and gas turbines, introducing hundreds of aeronautical engineers to this critical technology of post-war propulsion.\\n\\nAcross the nation, some of the most attended courses were in electronics and radio communications. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Tufts College, Northeastern University, Boston University, and Boston College joined forces to offer the ESMDT/ESMWT program; Dean Edward L. Moreland of MIT served as the coordinator. Much of it was in support of the Radiation Laboratory at MIT where microwave radar was being developed and the electronics firms in the northeast area.\\n\\nRutgers University was one of the few participants that included labor-management courses in its ESMWT offerings. These brought workers to the Rutgers campus in unprecedented numbers. The coordinator, Norman C. Miller stated, \"The spirit of patriotism, sacrifice, and co-operation that imbued both labor and management in service to the war effort was clearly evident in these courses.\" This effort carried into the post-war era with the establishment of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Rutgers,\\n\\nEntering ESMWT in Google brings up over 10,000 entries of a great variety concerning this program, much from archives, histories, catalogs, and newspapers of the participating colleges and universities.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "England", "body": "England () is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west; the Irish Sea is to the north west, the Celtic Sea to the south west and the North Sea to the east, with the English Channel to the south separating it from continental Europe. Most of England comprises the central and southern part of the island of Great Britain in the North Atlantic. The country also includes over 100&nbsp;smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\nThe area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period, but it takes its name from the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in AD 927, and since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century, has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world. The English language, the Anglican Church, and English law—the basis for the common law legal system of many other countries around the world—developed in England, and the country's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations. The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation. England's Royal Society laid the foundations of modern experimental science.\\n\\nEngland's terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. However, there are uplands in the north (for example, the mountainous Lake District, Pennines, and Yorkshire Dales) and in the south west (for example, Dartmoor and the Cotswolds). London, England's capital, is the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom and the largest urban zone in the European Union by most measures.#tag:ref England's population is about 51 million, around 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, and is largely concentrated in London, the South East and conurbation in the Midlands, the North West, the North East and Yorkshire, which each developed as major industrial region during the 19th century. Meadowlands and pastures are found beyond the major cities.\\n\\nThe Kingdom of England—which after 1284 included Wales—was a sovereign state until 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1800, Great Britain was united with Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, the Irish Free State was established as a separate dominion, but the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act in 1927 reincorporated into the kingdom six Irish counties to officially create the current United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\n\\nThe name \"England\" is derived from the Old English name Engla land, which means \"land of the Angles\". The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages. The Angles came from the Angeln peninsula in the Bay of Kiel area of the Baltic Sea. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of \"England\" to refer to the southern part of the island of Great Britain occurs in 897, and its modern spelling was first used in 1538.\\n\\nThe earliest attested mention of the name occurs in the 1st century work by Tacitus, Germania, in which the Latin word Anglii is used. The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an angular shape. How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the Saxons, came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain Angli Saxones or English Saxons.\\n\\nAn alternative name for England is Albion. The name Albion originally referred to the entire island of Great Britain. The earliest record of the name appears in the Aristotelian Corpus, specifically the 4th century BC De Mundo: \"Beyond the Pillars of Hercules is the ocean that flows round the earth. In it are two very large islands called Britannia; these are Albion and Ierne\". The word Albion (Ἀλβίων) or insula Albionum has two possible origins. It either derives from the Latin albus meaning white, a reference to the white cliffs of Dover, which is the first view of Britain from the European Continent, or from the phrase in Massaliote Periplus, the \"island of the Albiones\". Albion is now applied to England in a more poetic capacity. Another romantic name for England is Loegria, related to the Welsh word for England, Lloegr, and made popular by its use in Arthurian legend.\\n\\nthumbThe earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of Homo antecessor, dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago. Modern humans are known to have first inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years.After the last ice age only large mammals such as mammoth, bison and woolly rhinoceros remained. Roughly 11,000 years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now, and Britain was connected by land to both Ireland and Eurasia.As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000 years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.\\n\\nBeaker culture arrived around 2500 BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores. It was during this time that major Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, both of which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people were able to make bronze, and later iron from iron ore. According to John T. Koch and others, England in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that included all of Britain and also Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal. In those areas, Celtic languages developed; Tartessian may have been the earliest written Celtic language.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nDuring the Iron Age, Celtic culture, deriving from the Hallstatt and La Tène culture, arrived from Central Europe. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better plough, advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic field), as well as the production of more effective weapons. Brythonic was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to Ptolemy's Geographia there were around 20 different tribes in the area. However, earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the Roman Republic attempted to invade twice in 55 BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a client king from the Trinovantes.\\n\\nThe Romans conquered Britain in AD 43 during the reign of Emperor Claudius, and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as Britannia province. The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the Catuvellauni led by Caratacus. Later, an uprising led by Boudica, queen of the Iceni, ended with Boudicas suicide following her defeat at the Battle of Watling Street. This era saw a Greco-Roman culture prevail with the introduction of Roman Law, Roman architecture, sewage systems, many agricultural items, and silk. In the 3rd century, Emperor Septimius Severus died at York, where Constantine was subsequently proclaimed emperor. Christianity was first introduced around this time, though there are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through Joseph of Arimathea, while others claim through Lucius of Britain. By 410, as the empire declined, Britain was left exposed by the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and take part in civil wars.\\n\\nthumbRoman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Angles, Saxons and Jutes who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province and now began to settle, initially in the eastern part of the country. Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brythonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age. The nature and progression of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Christianity had in general disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 onwards and by Irish missionaries led by Aidan around the same time. Disputes between the varying influences represented by these missions ended in victory for the Roman tradition.\\n\\nDuring the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued. The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence. In the early 9th century the Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Athelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea empire that also included Denmark and Norway. However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.\\n\\nthumbA dispute over the succession to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy. The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.\\n\\nThe House of Plantagenet from Anjou inherited the English throne under Henry II, adding England to the budding Angevin Empire of fiefs the family had inherited in France including Aquitaine. They reigned for three centuries, proving noted monarchs such as Richard I, Edward I, Edward III and Henry V. The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of the Magna Carta, an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic monasticism flourished, providing philosophers and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The Principality of Wales became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century and the Lordship of Ireland was gifted to the English monarchy by the Pope.\\n\\nDuring the 14th century, the Plantagenets and House of Valois both claimed to be legitimate claimants to House of Capet and with it France—the two powers clashed in the Hundred Years' War. The Black Death epidemic hit England, starting in 1348, it eventually killed up to half of England's inhabitants. From 1453 to 1487 civil war between two branches of the royal family occurred—the Yorkists and Lancastrians—known as the Wars of the Roses. Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors, a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed.\\n\\nthumbThe Tudor period would prove to be eventful. The Renaissance reached England through Italian courtiers, who reintroduced artistic, educational and scholary debate from classical antiquity. During this time England began to develop naval skills, and exploration to the West intensified.\\n\\nHenry VIII broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. Contrary to much of European Protestantism, the roots of the split were more political than theological.#tag:ref He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters; Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former attempted to bring the country back to Catholicism, while the later broke from it again more forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism.\\n\\nAn English fleet under Francis Drake defeated an invading Spanish Armada during the Elizabethan period. Competing with Spain, the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer Walter Raleigh in Virginia and named Roanoke. The Roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony after it was found abandoned on the return of the late arriving supply ship. With the East India Company, England also competed with the Dutch and French to the East. The nature of the island was changed, when the Stuart King of Scotland, from a kingdom which was previously a long time rival, inherited the throne of England—creating a personal union under James I in 1603. He styled himself King of Great Britain, despite having no basis in English law.\\n\\nrightBased on conflicting political, religious and social positions, there was an English Civil War between the supporters of Parliament and those of king Charles I, known as Roundhead and Cavalier respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifacited Wars of the Three Kingdoms, involving Scotland and Ireland. The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced with the Commonwealth. Leader of the Parliament forces, Oliver Cromwell declared himself Lord Protector in 1653, a period of personal rule followed. After Cromwell's death, and his son Richard's resignation as Lord Protector, Charles II was invited to return as monarch in 1660 with the Restoration. It was now constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the Bill of Rights in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament and could not be suspended by the King, and the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without prior approval by Parliament. With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.\\n\\nThe Great Fire of London in 1666 gutted the capital but it was rebuilt shortly after. In Parliament two factions had emerged—the Tories and Whigs. The former were royalists while the latter were classical liberals. Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king James II, some of them, along with the Whigs deposed him at the Revolution of 1688 and invited Dutch prince William III to become monarch. Some English people, especially in the north were Jacobites and continued to support James and his sons. After the parliaments of England and Scotland both agreed, the two countries joined in political union, to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national church of each remained separate.\\n\\nthumbUnder the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English initiatives combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering. This paved the way for the establishment of the British Empire. Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development. The opening of northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain. In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway—the Stockton and Darlington Railway—opened to the public.\\n\\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, many workers moved from England's countryside to new and expanding urban industrial areas to work in factories, for instance at Manchester and Birmingham, dubbed \"Warehouse City\" and \"Workshop of the World\" respectively. England maintained relative stability throughout the French Revolution; William Pitt the Younger was British Prime Minister for the reign of George III. During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon Bonaparte planned to invade from the south-east. However this failed to manifest and the Napoleonic forces were defeated by the British at sea by Lord Nelson and on land by the Duke of Wellington. The Napoleonic Wars fostered a concept of Britishness and a united national British people, shared with the Scots and Welsh.\\n\\nthumbLondon became the largest and most populous metropolitan area in the world during the Victorian era, and trade within the British Empire—as well as the standing of the British military and navy—was prestigious. Political agitation at home from radicals such as the Chartists and the suffragette enabled legislative reform and universal suffrage. Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Allies.#tag:ref Two decades later, in World War II, the United Kingdom again fought for the Allies. Winston Churchill was the wartime Prime Minister. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during The Blitz. Following the war the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation, as well as a series of technological innovations; automobile became the primary means of transport, and Frank Whittle's development of the jet engine led to wider air travel. Residential patterns were altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. England's NHS provided publicly funded health care to all UK permanent residents free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. Combined, these changes prompted the reform of local government in England in the mid-20th century.\\n\\nSince the 20th century there has been significant population movement to England, mostly from other parts of the British Isles, but also from the Commonwealth, particularly the Indian subcontinent. Since the 1970s there has been a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the service industry. As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a common market initiative called the European Economic Community which became the European Union. Since the late 20th century the administration of the United Kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England and Wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism. There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum.\\n\\nthumbAs part of the United Kingdom, the basic political system in England is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system. There has not been a Government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707, putting into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England. Today England is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments. In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster, there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom general election, 2010 the Conservative Party had won an absolute majority in England's 532 contested seats with 61 seats more than all other parties combined (the Speaker of the House not being counted as a Conservative). However, taking Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales into account this was not enough to secure an overall majority, resulting in a hung parliament. In order to achieve a majority the Conservative party, headed by David Cameron, entered into a coalition agreement with the third largest party, the Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg. Subsequently Gordon Brown announced he was stepping down as prime minister and leader of the Labour party, now led by Ed Milliband.\\n\\nthumbAs the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union, there are elections held regionally in England to decide who is sent as Members of the European Parliament. The 2009 European Parliament election saw the regions of England elect the following MEPs: twenty-three Conservatives, ten Labour, nine United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), nine Liberal Democrats, two Greens and two British National Party (BNP).\\n\\nSince devolution, in which other countries of the United Kingdom—Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various regions of England would be devolved, but following the proposal's rejection by the North East in a referendum, this has not been carried out.\\n\\nOne major issue is the West Lothian question, in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on legislation affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters. This when placed in the context of England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and free top-up university fees, has led to a steady rise in English nationalism. Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament, while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.\\n\\nthumbThe English law legal system, developed over the centuries, is the foundation of many legal systems throughout the Anglosphere. Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in court, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent—stare decisis—to the facts before them.\\n\\nThe court system is headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice for civil cases, and the Crown Court for criminal cases. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in England and Wales. It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the judicial functions of the House of Lords. A decision of the Supreme Court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions.\\n\\nCrime increased between 1981 and 1995, but fell by 42% in the period 1995–2006. The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000. Her Majesty's Prison Service, reporting to the Ministry of Justice, manages most prisons, housing over 80,000 convicts.\\n\\n}The subdivisions of England consist of up to four levels of subnational division controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of local government. The highest tier of local government are the nine regions of England: North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East, South East, South West, and London. These were created in 1994 as Government Office, used by the British Government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London. The same boundaries are used for electing Members of the European Parliament on a regional basis.\\n\\nAfter devolution began to take place in other parts of the United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected regional assemblies as a counterweight. London accepted in 1998: the London Assembly was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the northern England devolution referendums, 2004 in the North East, further referendums were cancelled. There are plans to abolish the remaining regional assemblies in 2010 and transfer their functions to respective Regional Development Agencies and a new system of Local Authority Leaders' Board.\\n\\nBelow the regional level, all of England is divided into 48 ceremonial counties. These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference and have developed gradually since the Middle Ages, with some established as recently as 1974. Each has a Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff; these posts are used to represent the British monarch locally. Outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly, England is also divided into 83 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties; these correspond to areas used for the purposes of local government and may consist of a single district or be divided into several.\\n\\nThere are six metropolitan counties based on the most heavily urbanised areas, which do not have county councils. In these areas the principal authorities are the councils of the subdivisions, the metropolitan borough. Elsewhere, 27 non-metropolitan \"shire\" counties have a county council and are divided into districts, each with a district council. They are typically, though not always, found in more rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties are of a single district and usually correspond to large towns or counties with low populations; they are known as unitary authorities. Greater London has a different system for local government, with 32 London borough, plus the City of London covering a small area at the core, governed by the City of London Corporation. At the most localised level, much of England is divided into civil parish with councils; they do not exist in Greater London.\\n\\nthumbGeographically England comprises the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly. It is bordered by two fellow countries of the United Kingdom—to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales. England is closer to the European Continent than any other part of mainland Britain. It is separated from France by a  sea gap, though the two countries are connected by the Channel Tunnel near Folkestone. As England is on an island, it is surrounded by the water of the Irish Sea, North Sea and Atlantic Ocean.\\n\\nThe major ports of London, Liverpool, and Newcastle, lie on the tidal rivers of the Thames, Mersey and Tyne respectively. The tides raise the level of water in their estuaries and enable ships to enter the ports. At , the Severn is the longest river flowing through England. It empties into the Bristol Channel and is notable for its Severn Bore tidal waves, which can reach  in height. However, the longest river entirely in England is the Thames, which is  in length. There are many lakes in England but the majority are in the aptly named Lake District; the largest of which is Windermere, \\n\\nthumbIn geological terms, the Pennine, known as the \"backbone of England\", are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the Paleozoic Era around 300 million years ago. The total length of the Pennines is , peaking at Cross Fell in Cumbria. The material of which they are composed is mostly sandstone and limestone, but also coal. There are karst landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire. The Pennine landscape is high moorland in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain three national parks, the Yorkshire Dales, Northumberland, and the Peak District. The highest point in England, at , is Scafell Pike in Cumbria. Straddling the border between England and Scotland are the Cheviot Hills.\\n\\nThe English Lowlands are to the south of the Pennines, consisting of green rolling hills, including the Cotswold Hills, Chiltern Hills, North and South Downs—where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the cliffs of Dover. The granitic Southwest Peninsula in the West Country provides upland moorland, such as Dartmoor and Exmoor, which flourish with a mild climate; both are national parks.\\n\\nEngland has a temperate maritime climate meaning that it is mild with temperatures not much lower than  in winter and not much higher than  in summer. The weather is damp relatively frequently and is subject to change. The coldest months are January and February, the latter particularly on the English coast, while July is normally the warmest month. Months with mild to warm weather with least rainfall are May, June, September and October.\\n\\nThe biggest influences on the climate of England comes from the proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, its northern latitude and warming of the waters around the Gulf Stream. England receives quite a significant proportion of rainfall during the year, with autumn and winter being the wettest time—geographically the Lake District receives more rain than anywhere else in the country. Since weather recording records began, the highest temperature received was  on 10 August 2003 at Brogdale in Kent, while the lowest was  on 10 January 1982 in Edgmond, Shropshire.\\n\\nThe Greater London Urban Area is by far the largest metropolitan area in England and one of the busiest cities in the world. It is considered a global city and has a population larger than other countries in the United Kingdom besides England itself. Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern England or the English Midlands. There are fifty settlements which have been designated city status in England, while the wider United Kingdom has sixty-six.\\n\\nWhile many cities in England are quite large in size, such as Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, Bradford, Nottingham and others, a large population is not necessarily a prerequisite for a settlement to be afforded city status. Traditionally the status was afforded to towns with diocesan cathedrals and so there are smaller cities like Wells, Ely, Ripon, Truro and Chichester. According to the Office for National Statistics the ten largest, continuous built-up urban areas are:\\n\\nthumbEngland's economy is one of the largest in the world, with an average GDP per capita of £22,907. Usually regarded as a mixed market economy, it has adopted many free market principles, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure. The official currency in England is the pound sterling, also known as the GBP. Taxation in England is quite competitive when compared to much of the rest of Europe—as of 2009 the basic rate of personal tax is 20% on taxable income up to £37,400, and 40% on any additional earnings above that amount.\\n\\nThe economy of England is the largest part of the UK's economy, which has the 18th highest GDP PPP per capita in the world. England is a leader in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors and in key technical industries, particularly aerospace, the arms industry, and the manufacturing side of the software industry. London, home to the London Stock Exchange, the United Kingdom's main stock exchange and the largest in Europe, is England's financial centre—100 of Europe's 500 largest corporations are based in London. London is the largest financial centre in Europe, and as of 2009 is also the largest in the world.\\n\\nthumbThe Bank of England, founded in 1694 by Scottish banker William Paterson, is the United Kingdom's central bank. Originally instituted to act as private banker to the Government of England, it carried on in this role as part of the United Kingdom—since 1946 it has been a state-owned institution. The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales, although not in other parts of the United Kingdom. Its Monetary Policy Committee has devolved responsibility for managing the monetary policy of the country and setting interest rates.\\n\\nEngland is highly industrialised, but since the 1970s there has been a decline in traditional heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, automobiles—although many English marque are now foreign-owned, such as Rolls-Royce, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley—crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea Oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engine and alcoholic beverage. Agriculture is intensive and highly mechanised, producing 60% of food needs with only 2% of the labour force. Two thirds of production is devoted to livestock, the other to arable crops.\\n\\nthumbThe Department for Transport is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. There are several motorways in England, one of the most important trunk roads is the A1 Great North Road, stretching across the country from London to Newcastle. The longest motorway in England is the M6, stretching from Rugby to the North West up to the Anglo-Scottish border. There are other major roads; the M1 from London to Leeds, the M25 which encircles London, the M60 which encircles Manchester, the M4 from London to South Wales, the M62 from Liverpool to Manchester and East Yorkshire and the M5 from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.\\n\\nBus transport across the country is common, major companies include National Express, Arriva and Go-Ahead Group. The red double-decker bus in London have become a symbol of England. There is a rapid rail network in two English cities; the London Underground and the Tyne and Wear Metro, the latter in Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland. There are tram networks, such as; Blackpool, Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram and Midland Metro.\\n\\nthumbRail transport in England is the oldest in the world, with the system originating there in 1825. Much of Britain's  of rail network lies in England, covering the country extensively. These lines are mostly single, double or quadruple track, though there are narrow gauge lines. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the Channel Tunnel which was completed in 1994.\\n\\nThere are air transport facilities in England connected the public to numerous international locations, the largest airport is London Heathrow Airport which in terms of passenger volume in the busiest in Europe and one of the busiest in the world. Other large airports include Manchester Airport, London Stansted Airport, Luton Airport and Birmingham International Airport. By sea there is ferry transport, both for internal and external trips, some of the most common links are to Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium. Travel by waterways such as river, canal, docks is common with around  of navigable waterways in England, half of which is owned by British Waterways (Waterscape). The Thames is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the Port of Tilbury, one of the United Kingdom's three major ports.\\n\\nthumbThe National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded healthcare system in England responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by economist and social reformer William Beveridge. The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments, it provides most services at no additional cost though there are extra charges associated with eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.\\n\\nThe government department responsible for the NHS is the Department of Health, headed by the Secretary of State for Health, who sits in the British Cabinet. Most of the expenditure of the Department of Health is spent on the NHS—£98.6 billion was spent in 2008–2009. In recent years the private sector has been increasingly used to provide more NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions. The average life expectancy of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom.\\n\\n160pxWith over 51 million inhabitants, England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom, accounting for 84% of the combined total. England taken as a unit and measured against international states has the fourth largest population in the European Union and would be the 25th largest country by population in the world. With a density of 395 people per square kilometre, it would be the second most densely populated country in the European Union after Malta.\\n\\nThe English people are a British people Genetic evidence suggests that 75–95% descend in the paternal line from prehistoric settlers who originally came from the Iberian Peninsula. There is a significant Norse element, as well as a 5% contribution from Angles and Saxons, though other geneticists place the Norse-Germanic estimate up to half. Over time, various cultures have been influential: Prehistoric, Brythonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse Viking, Gaelic cultures, as well as a large influence from Normans. There is an English diaspora in former parts of the British Empire; especially the United States, Canada, Australia, Chile, South Africa and New Zealand.#tag:ref Since the late 1990s, English people have migrated to Spain.\\n\\nleftAt the time of the Domesday Book, compiled in 1086, more than 90% of the English population of about two million lived in the countryside. By 1801 the population had grown to 8.3 million, and by 1901 had grown to 30.5 million. Due in particular to the economic prosperity of South East England, there are many economic migrants from the other parts of the United Kingdom. There has been significant Irish migration, with 24% of British people and 77% of Londoners claiming Irish ancestry. The European population totals at 89.90%, including Germans and Poles.\\n\\nOther people from much further afield in the former British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 5.30% of people living in England have migrated from the Indian subcontinent, mostly India and Pakistan. 2.30% of the population are black, mostly from the Caribbean. There is a significant number of Chinese and British Chinese. As of 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from ethnic minority families. About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration. Debate over immigration is politically prominent; according to a Home Office poll, 80% of people want to cap it. The ONS has projected that the population will grow by six million between 2004 and 2029.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nAs its name suggests, the English language, today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue today. It is an Indo-European language in the Anglo-Frisian branch of the Germanic family. After the Norman conquest, the Old English language was displaced and confined to the lower social classes as Norman French and Latin were used by the aristocracy.\\n\\nBy the 17th century, English came back into fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, when it comes to incorporating words from different languages. Thanks in large part to the British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.\\n\\nEnglish language learning and teaching is an important economic activity, and includes language schooling, tourism spending, and publishing. There is no legislation mandating an official language for England, but English is the only language used for official business. Despite the country's relatively small size, there are many distinct regional accents, and individuals with particularly strong accents may not be easily understood everywhere in the country.\\n\\nCornish, which died out as a community language in the 18th century, is being revived, and is now protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is spoken by 0.1% of people in Cornwall, and is taught to some degree in several primary and secondary schools. State schools teach students a second language, usually French, German or Spanish. Due to immigration, it was reported in 2007 that around 800,000 school students spoke a foreign language at home, the most common being Punjabi and Urdu.\\n\\nthumbChristianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has been since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier, in Gaelic and Roman times. It continued through Early Insular Christianity, and today about 71.6% of English people identify as Christians. The largest form practised in the present day is Anglicanism, dating from the 16th century Reformation period, with the 1536 split from Rome over Henry VIII wanting to divorce Catherine of Aragon, the religion regards itself as both Catholic and Reformed.\\n\\nThere are High Church and Low Church traditions, and some Anglicans regard themselves as Anglo-Catholics, after the Tractarian movement. The monarch of the United Kingdom is the head of the Church, acting as its Supreme Governor. It has the status of established church in England. There are around 26 million adherents to the Church of England and they form part of the Anglican Communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury acting as the symbolic worldwide head. Many cathedrals and parish churches are historic buildings of significant architectural importance, such as Westminster Abbey, York Minster, Durham Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral.\\n\\nthumbThe second largest Christian practice is the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, which traces its formal, corporate history in England to the 6th century with Augustine's mission and was the main religion on the entire island for around a thousand years. Since its reintroduction after the Catholic Emancipation, the Church has organised ecclesiastically on an England and Wales basis where there are 4.5 million members (most of whom are English).\\n\\nThere has been one Pope from England to date, Adrian IV; while saints Bede and Anselm are regarded as Doctors of the Church. A form of Protestantism known as Methodism is the third largest and grew out of Anglicanism through John Wesley. It gained popularity in the mill town of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and amongst tin miners in Cornwall. There are other non-conformist minorities, such as Baptists, Quakers, Congregationalists, Unitarians and the Salvation Army.\\n\\nThe patron saint of England is Saint George, he is represented in the national flag, as well as the Union Flag as part of a combination. There are many other English and associated saints, some of the best known include; Cuthbert, Alban, Wilfrid, Aidan, Edward the Confessor, John Fisher, Thomas More, Petroc, Piran, Margaret Clitherow and Thomas Becket. There are non-Christian religions practised. Jews have a history of a small minority on the island since 1070. They were expelled from England in 1290 following the Edict of Expulsion, only to be allowed back in 1656.\\n\\nEspecially since the 1950s Eastern religions from the former British colonies have began to appear, due to foreign immigration; Islam is the most common of these accounting for around 3.1% in England. Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism are next in number adding up to 2% combined, introduced from India and South East Asia. Around 14.6% claim to have no religion.\\n\\nthumbThe body responsible for state education in general up to the age of 19, in the United Kingdom is the Department for Children, Schools and Families—this body directly controls state schools in England. Funded through taxation state-run schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren. There is a minority of faith school, mostly Church of England or Catholic Church. Between three and four is nursery school, four and eleven is primary school, and eleven to sixteen is secondary school, with an option for a two-year extension to attend sixth form college.\\n\\nAlthough most English secondary schools are comprehensive, in some areas there are selective intake grammar school, to which entrance is subject to passing the eleven plus exam. Around 7.2% of English schoolchildren attend private schools, which are funded by private sources. Standards are monitored by regular inspections of state-funded schools by the Office for Standards in Education and of private schools by the Independent Schools Inspectorate.\\n\\nthumbAfter finishing compulsory education, pupils take a GCSE examination, following which they may decide to continue in further education and attend a further education college. Students normally enter universities in the United Kingdom from 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree. England has more than 90 state-funded universities, which are monitored by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. Students are generally entitled to student loan for maintenance.#tag:ref The first degree offered to undergraduates is the Bachelor's degree, which usually takes three years to complete. Students are then eligible for a postgraduate degree, a Master's degree, taking one year, or a Doctorate degree, which takes three.\\n\\nEngland has a history of promoting education, and its top institutions are internationally respected. The most acclaimed English universities are Oxford and Cambridge. These two \"ancient universities\" have many common features and are nowadays known as Oxbridge. The King's School, Canterbury and The King's School, Rochester are the oldest schools in the English-speaking world. Many of England's better-known schools, such as Winchester College, Eton College, St Paul's School, Rugby School, and Harrow School are fee-paying institutions.\\n\\nthumbProminent English figures from the field of science and mathematics include Sir Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle, Joseph Priestley, J. J. Thomson, Charles Babbage, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, Christopher Wren, Alan Turing, Francis Crick, Joseph Lister, Tim Berners-Lee, Andrew Wiles and Richard Dawkins. Some experts claim that the earliest concept of a metric system was invented by John Wilkins, first secretary of the Royal Society in 1668. As birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, England was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and early 19th century. Famous English engineers include Isambard Kingdom Brunel, best known for the creation of the Great Western Railway, a series of famous steamship, and numerous important bridges, hence revolutionising public transport and modern-day engineering. Thomas Newcomen's steam engine helped spawn the Industrial Revolution. The physician Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine is said to have \"saved more lives [...] than were lost in all the wars of mankind since the beginning of recorded history.\"\\n\\nInventions and discoveries of the English include; the jet engine, the first industrial spinning machine, the first computer and the first modern computer, the World Wide Web along with HTTP and HTML, the first successful human blood transfusion, the motorised vacuum cleaner, the lawnmower, the seat belt, the hovercraft, the electric motor, steam engine, and theories such as the Darwinian theory of evolution and atomic theory. Newton developed the ideas of universal gravitation, Newtonian mechanics, and infinitesimal calculus, and Robert Hooke his eponymously named law of elasticity. Other inventions include the iron plate railway, the thermosiphon, tarmac, the rubber band, the mousetrap, \"cat's eye\" road safety device, joint development of the light bulb, steam locomotive, the modern seed drill and many modern techniques and technologies used in precision engineering.\\n\\nthumbMany ancient standing stone monuments were erected during the prehistoric period, amongst the best known are Stonehenge, Devil's Arrows, Rudston Monolith and Castlerigg. With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture there was a development of basilicas, baths, amphitheaters, triumphal arch, villas, Roman temple, Roman road, Roman fort, stockade and aqueduct. It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best known example is Hadrian's Wall stretching right across northern England. Another well preserved example is the Roman Baths at Bath, Somerset.\\n\\nEarly Medieval architecture's secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of Hiberno—Saxon monasticism, to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best known medieval castles include the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle amongst others.\\n\\nthumbThroughout the Plantagenet era an English Gothic architecture flourished—the medieval cathedrals such as Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and York Minster are prime examples. Expanding on the Norman base there was also castle, palace, great houses, universities and parish church. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th century Tudor style; the four-centred arch, now known as the Tudor arch, was a defining feature as were wattle and daub houses domestically. In the aftermath of the Renaissance a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity, synthesised with Christianity appeared—the English Baroque style, architect Christopher Wren was particularly championed.\\n\\nGeorgian architecture followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched—in addition to this around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace. Since the 1930s various modernist forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.#tag:ref\\n\\nthumbEnglish folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include pixie, giants, elf, bogeymen, troll, goblin and dwarves. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, for instance the tales featuring Offa of Angeln and Weyland Smith, others date from after the Norman invasion; Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood and their battles with the Sheriff of Nottingham being, perhaps, the best known.\\n\\nDuring the High Middle Ages tales originating from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the Arthurian myth. These were derived from Anglo-Norman, French and Welsh sources, featuring King Arthur, Camelot, Excalibur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table such as Lancelot. These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae.#tag:ref Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, may have been based on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make up part of the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.\\n\\nthumbSome folk figures are based on semi or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries; Lady Godiva for instance was said to have ridden naked on horseback through Coventry, Hereward the Wake was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, Herne the Hunter is an equestrian ghost associated with Windsor Forest and Great Park and Mother Shipton is the archetypal witch. On 5 November people make bonfires, set off firework and eat toffee apple in commemoration of the foiling of the Gunpowder Plot centred around Guy Fawkes. The chivalrous bandit, such as Dick Turpin, is a recurring character, while Blackbeard is the archetypal pirate. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as Morris dancing, Maypole dancing, Rapper sword in the North East, Long Sword dance in Yorkshire, Mummers Play, bottle-kicking in Leicestershire, and cheese-rolling at Cooper's Hill. There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the Pearly Kings and Queens associated with cockneys, the Royal Guard, the Morris costume and Beefeater.\\n\\nthumbSince the Early Modern Period the food of England has historically been characterised by its simplicity of approach, honesty of flavour, and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce. During the Middle Ages and through the Renaissance period, English cuisine enjoyed an excellent reputation, though a decline began during the Industrial Revolution with the move away from the land and increasing urbanisation of the populace. The French sometimes referred to English people as les rosbifs, as a stereotype to suggest English food is unsophisticated or crude. The cuisine of England has, however, recently undergone a revival, which has been recognised by the food critics with some good ratings in Restaurant's best restaurant in the world charts. An early book of English recipes is the Forme of Cury from the royal court of Richard II.\\n\\nthumbTraditional examples of English food include the Sunday roast; featuring a roasted joint, usually beef, lamb or chicken, served with assorted boiled vegetables, Yorkshire pudding and gravy. Other prominent meals include fish and chips and the full English breakfast—consisting of bacon, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, black pudding, baked beans, fried mushrooms, sausages and eggs. Various meat pie are consumed such as steak and kidney pie, shepherd's pie, cottage pie, Cornish pasty and pork pie, the later of which is consumed cold.\\n\\nSausages are commonly eaten, either as bangers and mash or toad in the hole. Lancashire hotpot is a well known stew. Some of the most popular cheese are Cheddar and Wensleydale. Many Anglo-Indian hybrid dishes, curries, have been created such as chicken tikka masala and balti. Sweet English dishes include apple pie, mince pie, spotted dick, scones, Eccles cake, custard and sticky toffee pudding. Common drinks include tea, which became far more widely drunk due to Catherine of Braganza, while alcoholic drinks include wine and English beer such as bitter, mild, stout, and brown ale.\\n\\nthumbThe earliest known examples are the prehistoric rock and cave art pieces, most prominent in North Yorkshire, Northumberland and Cumbria, but also feature further south, for example at Creswell Crags. With the arrival of Roman culture in the 1st century, various forms of art utilising statues, busts, glasswork and mosaics were the norm. There are numerous surviving artefacts, such as those at Lullingstone and Aldborough. During the Early Middle Ages the style was sculpted crosses and ivories, manuscript painting, gold and enamel jewellery, demonstrating a love of intricate, interwoven designs such as in the Staffordshire Hoard discovered in 2009. Some of these blended Gaelic and Anglian styles, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and Vespasian Psalter. Later Gothic art was popular at Winchester and Canterbury, examples survive such as Benedictional of St. Æthelwold and Luttrell Psalter.\\n\\nThe Tudor era saw prominent artists as part of their court, portrait painting which would remain an enduring part of English art, was boosted by German Hans Holbein, natives such as Nicholas Hilliard built on this. Under the Stuarts, Continental artists were influential especially the Flemish, examples from the period include—Anthony van Dyck, Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller and William Dobson. The 18th century was a time of significance with the founding of the Royal Academy, a classicism based on the High Renaissance prevailed—Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds became two of England's most treasured artists.\\n\\nThe Norwich School continued the landscape tradition, while the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with their vivid and detailed style revived the Early Renaissance style—Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais were leaders. Prominent amongst twentieth century artists was Henry Moore, regarded as the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general. Contemporary painters include Lucian Freud, whose work Benefits Supervisor Sleeping in 2008 set a world record for sale value of a painting by a living artist.\\n\\nthumbEarly authors wrote in Latin such as Bede and Alcuin. The period of Old English literature provided the epic poem Beowulf, the secular prose the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, along with Christian writings such as Judith, Cædmon's Hymn and saintly hagiographies. Following the Norman conquest Latin continued amongst the educated classes, as well as an Anglo-Norman literature.\\n\\nMiddle English literature emerged with Geoffrey Chaucer author of The Canterbury Tales, along with Gower, the Pearl Poet and Langland. Franciscans, William of Ockham and Roger Bacon were major philosopher of the Middle Ages. Julian of Norwich with her Revelations of Divine Love was a prominent Christian mystic. With the English Renaissance literature in the Early Modern English style appeared. William Shakespeare, whose works include Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and A Midsummer Night's Dream, remains one of the most championed authors in English literature.\\n\\nMarlowe, Spenser, Sydney, Kyd, Donne, Jonson are other established authors of the Elizabethan age. Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes wrote on empiricism and materialism, including scientific method and social contract. Filmer wrote on the Divine Right of Kings. Marvell was the best known poet of the Commonwealth, while John Milton authored Paradise Lost during the Restoration.Some of the most prominent philosophers from the Enlightenment were Locke, Paine, Johnson and Benthem. More radical elements were later countered by Edmund Burke who is regarded as the founder of conservatism. The poet Alexander Pope with his satirical verse became well regarded. The English played a significant role in romanticism—Coleridge, Byron, Keats, M Shelley, PB Shelley, Blake and Wordsworth were major figures.\\n\\nIn response to the Industrial Revolution, agrarian writers looked to find a way between liberty and tradition; Cobbett, Chesterton and Belloc were main exponents, while founder of guild socialism, Penty and cooperative movement advocate Cole are somewhat related. Empiricism continued through Mill and Russell, while Williams was involved in analytics. Authors from around the time of the Victorian era include Dickens, the Brontë sisters, Austen, Eliot, Kipling, Hardy, H. G. Wells, Carroll and Underhill. Since then England has continued to produce novellists such as C. S. Lewis, Orwell, D. H. Lawrence, Woolf, Blyton, Huxley, Christie, Pratchett, J. R. R. Tolkien, and J. K. Rowling.\\n\\nThe traditional folk music of England is centuries old and has contributed to several genres prominently; mostly sea shanties, jig, hornpipe and dance music. It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities. Wynkyn de Worde printed ballads of Robin Hood from the 16th century are an important artefact, as are John Playford's The Dancing Master and Robert Harley's Roxburghe Ballads collections. Some of the best known songs are The Good Old Way, Pastime with Good Company, Maggie May and Spanish Ladies amongst others. Many nursery rhymes are of English origin such as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roses are red, Jack and Jill, Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush and Humpty Dumpty.\\n\\nEarly English composers in classical music include Renaissance artists Thomas Tallis and William Byrd, followed up by Henry Purcell from the Baroque period. German-born George Frideric Handel became a British subject and spent most of his composing life in London, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, The Messiah, Water Music, and Music for the Royal Fireworks. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Edward Elgar, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others. Present-day composers from England include Michael Nyman, best known for The Piano.\\n\\nIn the field of popular music many English bands and solo artists have been cited as the most influential and best-selling musicians of all time. Acts such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Elton John, Queen, Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones are among the highest selling recording artists in the world. Many musical genres have origins or strong associations with England, such as British invasion, hard rock, glam rock, heavy metal, mod, britpop, drum and bass, progressive rock, punk rock, indie rock, gothic rock, shoegazing, acid house, UK garage, trip hop and dubstep.\\n\\nLarge outdoor music festivals in the summer and autumn are popular, such as Glastonbury, V Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals. The most prominent opera house in England is the Royal Opera House at Covent Gardens. The Proms, a season of orchestral classical music concerts held at the Royal Albert Hall, is a major cultural event held annually. The Royal Ballet is one of the world's foremost classical ballet companies, its reputation built on two prominent figures of 20th century dance, prima ballerina Margot Fonteyn and choreographer Frederick Ashton.\\n\\nthumbEnglish Heritage is a governmental body with a broad remit of managing the historic sites, artefacts and environments of England. It is currently sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The charity National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty holds a contrasting role. Seventeen of the twenty-five United Kingdom UNESCO World Heritage Site fall within England. Some of the best known of these include; Hadrian's Wall, Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites, Tower of London, Jurassic Coast, Saltaire, Ironbridge Gorge, Studley Royal Park and various others.\\n\\nThere are many museums in England, but the most notable is London's British Museum. Its collection of more than seven million objects is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the world, sourced from every continent, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginning to the present. The British Library in London is the national library and is one of the world's largest research libraries, holding over 150 million items in all known languages and formats; including around 25 million books. The most senior art gallery is the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, which houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The Tate galleries house the national collections of British and international modern art; they also host the famously controversial Turner Prize.\\n\\nthumbEngland has a strong sporting heritage, and during the 19th century codified many sports that are now played around the world. Sports originating in England include association football, cricket, rugby union, rugby league, tennis, badminton, squash, rounders, hockey, boxing, snooker, billiards, darts, table tennis, bowls, netball, thoroughbred horseracing and fox hunting. It has helped the development of sailing and Formula One. Football is the most popular of these sports. The England national football team, whose home venue is Wembley Stadium, won the FIFA World Cup in 1966, the year the country hosted the competition.\\n\\nAt club level England is recognised by FIFA as the birth-place of club football, due to Sheffield FC founded in 1857 being the oldest club. The Football Association is the oldest of its kind, FA Cup and The Football League were the first cup and league competitions respectively. In the modern day the Premier League is the world's most lucrative football league and amongst the elite. The European Cup has been won by Liverpool, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa, while Arsenal, Chelsea and Leeds United have reached the final.\\n\\nthumbCricket is generally thought to have been developed in the early medieval period among the farming and metalworking communities of the Weald. The England cricket team is a composite England and Wales team. One of the game's top rivalries is The Ashes series between England and Australia, contested since 1882. The finale of the 2009 Ashes was watched by nearly 2 million people, although the climax of the 2005 Ashes was viewed by 7.4 million as it was available on terrestrial television. England are the current holders of the trophy and are fifth in both Test and One Day International cricket.\\n\\nEngland has hosted four Cricket World Cup (1975, 1979, 1983, 1999) and the ICC World Twenty20 in 2009. There are several domestic level competitions, including the County Championship in which Yorkshire are by far the most successful club having won the competition 31 times. Lord's Cricket Ground situated in London is sometimes referred to as the \"Mecca of Cricket\". William Penny Brookes was prominent in organising the format for the modern Olympic Games. London hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1908 and 1948, and will host them again in 2012. England competes in the Commonwealth Games, held every four years. Sport England is the governing body responsible for distributing funds and providing strategic guidance for sporting activity in England. A Grand Prix is held at Silverstone.\\n\\nthumbThe England rugby union team won the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the country was one of the host nations of the competition in the 1991 Rugby World Cup and is set to host the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The top level of club participation is the English Premiership. Leicester Tigers, London Wasps, Bath Rugby and Northampton Saints have had success in the Europe-wide Heineken Cup. In another form of the sport—rugby league which was born in Huddersfield in 1895, the England national rugby league team are ranked third in the world and first in Europe.\\n\\nSince 2008 England has been a full test nation in lieu of the Great Britain national rugby league team, which won three World Cups but is now retired. Club sides play in Super League, the present-day embodiment of the Rugby Football League Championship. Some of the most successful clubs include Wigan Warriors, St Helens, Leeds Rhinos and Huddersfield Giants; the former three have all won the World Club Challenge previously. The United Kingdom is to host the 2013 Rugby League World Cup. In tennis, the Wimbledon Championships are the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely considered the most prestigious.\\n\\nthumbThe national flag of England, known as St. George's Cross, has been the national flag since the 13th century. Originally the flag was used by the maritime state the Republic of Genoa. The English monarch paid a tribute to the Doge of Genoa from 1190 onwards, so that English ships could fly the flag as a means of protection when entering the Mediterranean.A red cross acted as a symbol for many Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries. It became associated with Saint George, along with countries and cities, which claimed him as their patron saint and used his cross as a banner. Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of the design of the Union Flag, a Pan-British flag designed by King James I.leftThere are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the Tudor rose, the nation's floral emblem, the White Dragon and the Three Lions featured on the Royal Arms of England. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England around the time of the Wars of the Roses as a symbol of peace. It is a syncretic symbol in that it merged the white rose of the Yorkists and the red rose of the Lancastrians—cadet branches of the Plantagenets who went to war over control of the royal house. It is also known as the Rose of England. The oak tree is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The term Royal Oak is used to denote the escape of King Charles II from the grasps of the parliamentarians after his father's execution; he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before making it safely into exile.\\n\\nThe Royal Arms of England, a national coat of arms featuring three lions, dates back to its adoption by Richard the Lionheart from 1198–1340. It is described as gules, three lions passant guardant or and provide one of the most prominent symbols of England; it is similar to the traditional arms of Normandy. England does not have an official designated national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has God Save the Queen. However, the following are often considered unofficial English national anthems:Jerusalem, Land of Hope and Glory (used for England during the 2002 Commonwealth Games), and I Vow to Thee, My Country. England's National Day is St George's Day, as Saint George is the patron saint of England, it is held annually on 23 April.\\n\\nace:Inggréhdsb:Engelskaext:Ingalaterraarz:انجلتراpnb:انگلستانkaa:Angliyastq:Ängloundszl:Yngland\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Engle Monumental Clock", "body": "thumb\\n\\nThe Engle Monumental Clock is a monumental clock designed by Stephen Decatur Engle. \\n\\nThe first known monumental clock made in the United States was the Engle Monumental Clock. The clock was made entirely by clock designer Stephen Decatur Engle in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. It took Engle 20 years to complete the construction of this clock which was finished in 1878. Wanting to display the clock rather than turning a profit, he turned the clock over to two Philadelphia entrepreneurs who marketed the clock as \"The Eighth Wonder of the World.\"  They toured the clock throughout the Eastern United States, charging 15–25 cents to view it. It continued to tour across the Eastern United States for 70 years before disappearing in 1951. The clock is currently at the National Clock and Watch Museum. \\n\\nThe Engle Monumental Clock measures 11' high, 8' wide, and 3' deep and contains three towers. \"Among its mechanical features are two organ movements, 48 moving figures, and a new type of tellurian (patented by Engle) that illustrates the positions of the moon, constellations, and zodiac relative to the rotating earth.\"  The clock also indicates the day of the week, current month, the phase of the moon, and even the current tides. The clock's first promoter was so convinced of its \"technical complexity\" that he offered a reward of $50,000 to anyone who found a clock that did \"more and worked better.\" \\n\\nThe clock used a number of moving figures including Jesus Christ, the twelve Apostles, the three Marys, Satan, Father Time, the three Ages of Man, Death, Justice, Orpheus, and Linus. Stephen Engle placed an image of himself representing \"Middle Age\" as his signature of the clock's maker. On the hour, a skeleton representing Death strikes a bone against a skull attached to the column of the clock. At 15, 30, and 45 minutes past the hour, Father Time strikes a bell with a scythe and turns his sandglass while the central figures of Youth, Middle Age, and Old Age revolve in the arch above the clock dial. At 40 minutes past the hour, a group of revolutionary soldiers appear from the clock while a barrel organ plays \"patriotic tunes\". At 55 minutes past the hour, the three Marys come out of the center tower as a procession of the Apostles takes place accompanied by religious hymns. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "English Council of State", "body": "The English Council of State, later also known as the Protector's Privy Council, was first appointed by the Rump Parliament on 14 February 1649 after the execution of King Charles I.\\n\\nCharles's execution on 30 January was delayed for several hours so that the House of Commons could pass an emergency bill to make it an offence to proclaim a new King and to declare the representatives of the people, the House of Commons, as the source of all just power. This in effect abolished the Monarchy and the House of Lords.\\n\\nThe Council of State was appointed by Parliament on 14 and 15 February 1649, with further annual elections. The Council's duties were to act as the Executive of the country's government in place of the King and the Privy Council. It was to direct domestic and foreign policy and to ensure the security of the English Commonwealth. Due to the disagreements between the New Model Army and the weakened Parliament it was dominated by the Army.\\n\\nThe Council held its first meeting on 17 February 1649 \"with [Oliver] Cromwell in the chair\". This meeting was quite rudimentary, \"some 14 members\" attending, barely more than the legal quorum of nine out of forty-one councillors elected by Parliament. The first elected president of the council, appointed on 12 March, was John Bradshaw who had been the President of the Court at the trial of Charles I and the first to sign the King's death warrant.\\n\\nThe members of the first council were the Earls of Denbigh, Mulgrave, Pembroke, Salisbury, Lords Grey and Fairfax, Lisle, Rolle, Oliver St. John, Wilde, Bradshaw, Cromwell, Skippon, Pickering, Masham, Haselrig, Harrington, Vane jun, Danvers, Armine, Mildmay, Constable, Pennington, Wilson, Whitelocke, Martin, Ludlow, Stapleton, Hevingham, Wallop, Hutchinson, Bond, Popham, Valentine Walton, Scot, Purefoy, Jones.\\n\\nAt the start of the Protectorate, ten days after the dissolution of the Rump Parliament on 20 April 1653, Cromwell told the Council that it no longer existed and together with the Council of Officers, instituted a new Council of State. With the failure of the Barebones Parliament, the Council was re-modelled with the Instrument of Government to become something much closer to the old Privy Council advising the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. Constitutionally between thirteen and twenty-one councillors were elected by Parliament to advise the Protector, who was also elected by Parliament. In reality Cromwell relied on the Army for support and chose his own councillors.\\n\\nThe replacement constitution of 1657, the pseudo-monarchical Humble Petition and Advice, authorised 'His Highness the Lord Protector'; to choose twenty-one Councillors and the power to nominate his successor. Cromwell recommended his eldest surviving son Richard Cromwell, who was proclaimed the successor on his father's death on 3 September 1658 and legally confirmed in the position by the newly elected Third Protectorate Parliament on 27 January 1659.\\n\\nAfter the reinstatement of the Rump Parliament (7 May 1659) and the subsequent abolition of the position of Lord Protector, the role of the Council of State along with other interregnum institutions becomes confused as the instruments of state started to implode. The Council of State was not dissolved until 28 May 1660, when King Charles II personally assumed the government in London.\\n\\nThe role of the President of the Council of State (usually addressed as \"Lord President\") was intended to simply preside over the Council of State.\\n\\nJohn Bradshaw, the first president, served in the office longer than any other person to do so (serving for two years and ten months total). The reason no other individual served in the position longer than Bradshaw was due to a resolution passed by the Parliament on 26 November 1651 stating that \"That no Person of any Committee of Parliament, or of the Council of State, shall be in the Chair of that Committee, or Council, for any longer Time, at once, than one Month\" (Commons Journal, 7:43-44). Even during the Protectorate of Oliver and Richard Cromwell, the position of Lord President of the Council of State, known during this period as the Protector's Privy Council, remained in existence until the re-establishment of the monarchy in 1660.\\n\\nThe following is a list of those who served as the Lord President of the Council of State.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "English Wars (Scandinavia)", "body": "The English Wars were a series of conflicts between Sweden and Denmark as part of the Napoleonic Wars. It is named after the most prominent region of its other main participant, the United Kingdom, which declared war on Denmark due to disagreements over the neutrality of Danish trade and to prevent the Danish fleet falling into the hands of the First French Empire. It began with the First Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 and its latter stage from 1807 onwards is also known as the Gunboat War.\\n\\nAfter the death of Denmark's foreign minister Andreas Peter Bernstorff in 1797, crown prince Frederick began exerting his will in all areas. This meant that the finance minister Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann ignored protests from the foreign minister Christian Bernstoff to finally grant the Dutch-born merchant Frédéric de Coninck's repeated requests for a naval convoy to accompany 40 merchantmen. This convoy transported mainly French and Dutch products from the Dutch East Indies to Copenhagen. This led to an 'armed neutrality' and though it gave mixed signals to the rest of the world as to that neutrality Denmark continued to insist on the inviolability of ships sailing under neutral flags. Several other such convoys set out the following day and these were given orders to resist if foreign naval ships attempted to examine the papers or cargoes in ships under the Danish flag, whatever the size of the force the convoy was faced with. This was a high-risk strategy since many non-Danish ships were sailing under the Danish flag to gain their neutrality benefits, and though the policy proved profitable in its first year it also drew diplomatic protests from the United Kingdom. In December 1799 an English sailor attempting to check a Danish-flagged ship at Gibraltar was killed. When in 1800 it appeared that Russia would head a new League of Armed Neutrality the United Kingdom reacted, in summer that year having a squadron of 130 guns try to board a Danish convoy escorted by the 40-gun frigate Freya at Ostend. In accordance with his orders the captain of the Freya refused and gave battle, but was forced to strike its flag after an hour. This led to Denmark asking Russia to join the Armed Neutrality, though in August a British fleet arrived off Copenhagen. Under threat of a British bombardment Christian Bernstorff promised to stop convoys temporarily while Denmark and the UK set up common rules on how and when convoys were to be used. The following month a Russian ambassador arrived in Denmark with a formal invitation for a country to join the League of Armed Neutrality of Sweden, Russia and Prussia (headed by the Russian tsar), which it did in December 1800. However, in 1801 the Tsar signed an alliance with France and Russia and France then forced through the closure of all European ports to British trade, leading the UK to demand that Denmark immediately leave the League. However, such a departure would make Denmark appear to ally itself with the UK and thus almost certainly lead to its being invaded by one of France or Russia's allies - Sweden had an eye to gaining Norway from Denmark and, if Prussia could conquer Jutland at the same time, British access to the Baltic Sea could be completely cut off. Denmark thus chose the lesser of two evils and refused all British proposals for negotiations. The UK thus sent a fleet against Denmark on 12 March 1801 to remove Denmark from the League by force.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nFrom 1807 to 1813 the war was characterised by high inflation, with wages increasing several hundred percent and grain prices even more. It was not cheap for Denmark to keep an army operating in Holstein and although in 1810 the Danish government introduced a progressive income tax to cover the deficit, it did not have the administrative machinery needed to get this new system to work but instead tried to make up the deficit by printing more and more banknotes. From 1806 to 1813 the currency's total face value increased sixfold but the notes' real value significantly decreased. Thus the state itself went bankrupt, trying to remedy the situation by rushing through a regulation on 5 January 1813 for a change in the monetary system. The regulation determined that a new foreign bank would replace the old banks and start minting new coins with values fixed against foreign banknotes. This made minor savers, people with their money tied up in government bonds, or people holding higher-value banknotes relatively poor.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "English football on television", "body": "English football on television has been broadcast since 1937, and since the establishment of the Premier League in 1992 it has become a very lucrative industry. As of the 2007-08 season, television rights for the 20-team Premier League are valued at close to £1bn each season. Based on July 2007 exchange rate, this is only marginally less than what American football's 32-team NFL receives from its TV contracts.\\n\\nThe BBC started its television service in 1936, although it was nearly a year before the very first televised match of football was screened – a specially-arranged friendly match between Arsenal and Arsenal Reserves at Highbury on 16 September 1937. This was followed by the first international match, between England and Scotland on 9 April 1938, and the first televised FA Cup final followed soon after, on 30 April the same year, between Huddersfield Town and Preston North End.\\n\\nHowever, coverage of football television did not expand and for the next two decades the only matches screened were FA Cup final and the odd England v. Scotland match. The first FA Cup tie other than the final to be shown was a fifth round match between Charlton Athletic and Blackburn Rovers on 8 February 1947, but matches were sparing and only games in London could be broadcast, for technical reasons.\\n\\nThe advent of floodlighting led to the creation of the European Cup, designed as a midweek cup competition for the champions of European nations, in 1955. The newly formed British television station ITV saw televised football as an ideal way of gaining a share of the audience from their only rival broadcaster, the BBC. The BBC meanwhile, started showing brief highlights of matches (with a maximum of five minutes) on its Saturday-night Sports Special programme from 10 September 1955, until its cancellation in 1963. The first games featured were both from Division One - Luton Town v Newcastle United and Charlton Athletic v Everton, Kenneth Wolstenholme and Cliff Michelmore were the commentators.\\n\\nThe BBC had a new highlights programme from 1964 - Match of the Day. Originally shown on BBC2 and intended to train BBC cameramen for the forthcoming 1966 World Cup the format was a success and has remained on British television in some form to this day. The first game saw Liverpool beat Arsenal at Anfield. \\n\\nAn early attempt at live league football was made in 1960-61, when ITV agreed a deal worth £150,000 with the Football League to screen 26 matches; the very first live league match was on Saturday 10 September 1960 between Blackpool and Bolton Wanderers at Bloomfield Road. The match kicked off at 6:50 pm with live coverage starting at 7:30 under the title The Big Game. A major blow to the TV moguls was the absence of big box office draw Stanley Matthews through injury, and the game ended 1-0 to Bolton in front of a half-empty stadium.\\n\\nHowever ITV withdrew from the deal after first Arsenal and then Tottenham Hotspur refused them permission to shoot at their matches against Newcastle United and Aston Villa respectively, and the Football League demanded a dramatic increase in player appearance payments. ITV showed the Nat King Cole Show instead, while ironically both matches received highlights coverage from the BBC on Sports Special.\\n\\nHowever ITV moved again into football, albeit tentatively, in 1962 when Anglia Television launched Match of the Week, which showed highlights of matches from around East Anglia. The first match shown was Ipswich Town's 3-2 defeat at the hands of Wolves at Portman Road on 22 September 1962. Tyne Tees Television in the North East of England began broadcasting local matches soon after under the title Shoot. League football was soon to gain a nationwide audience once more. In 1964, the BBC introduced Match of the Day - initially broadcast on the new BBC2. The first match was Liverpool's 3-2 victory over Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August, and the estimated audience of 20,000 was considerably less than the number of paying customers at the ground. At the time BBC2 could only be received in the London area, although by the end of Match Of The Day's first season it could be sampled in the Midlands. The programme transferred to BBC1 in the wake of England's 1966 World Cup win and at last could be received by television viewers across the UK.\\n\\nThere was live coverage of World Cup football on UK screens in 1954 and 1958 - however only selected matches were available. In 1954, Kenneth Wolstenholme provided commentary on the few televised matches for BBC from Switzerland - including the quarter-final between Hungary and Brazil. A thunderstorm over the Alps cut off the picture and many irate viewers wrote in to complain that the BBC had pulled the plug. The 1958 tournament in Sweden saw a greater range of matches thanks to the new Eurovision Network; the BBC and ITV both screened matches, although the networks had to overcome opposition to the coverage from the Scottish FA, who were worried that attendances at Junior football matches may be hit. The 1962 World Cup in Chile was covered in delayed form by the BBC with film having to be carried by air via the United States back to Britain. Matches were generally seen three days after they were played, though every match was covered by the BBC with commentary.\\n\\nWith intercontinental communications satellites in their infancy and videotape a new advance, the first tournament to gain widespread international live coverage was the 1966 tournament, which was held in England. The tournament, which England won, increased the popularity of the sport. With more football viewers than ever, Match of the Day thrived - switching from BBC Two to BBC One to reach a wider audience. ITV's regional coverage had also expanded during this period with London weekend company ATV launching Star Soccer in October 1965, Southern Television's Southern Soccer and ABC's World of Soccer also began to appear regularly in the TV Times Sunday schedules. London Weekend Television's The Big Match started in 1968, and eventually the entire ITV network's football coverage would be broadcast under its title.\\n\\nThe demand for football grew through the 1970s and early 1980s, and the decision to start screening live league matches was almost inevitable; a deal was struck for the start of the 1983-84 season and the first live league match since 1960 was screened on ITV, between Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest, on 2 October 1983. Spurs would also feature in the BBC's first live league match at Manchester United on a Friday night a few weeks later.\\n\\nBy the late 1980s the value of live TV coverage had rocketed; while a two-year contract for rights in 1983 had cost just £5.2m, the four-year contract exclusively landed by ITV in 1988 cost £44m, a fourfold increase per year. There was now a situation where live football was on TV almost every Sunday afternoon from about November onwards, as ITV screened top-flight football most weeks and the BBC had the rights to the FA Cup that occupied other weekends.\\n\\nWith top flight football proving particularly lucrative, in 1992 the clubs of the Football League First Division voted to quit the league en masse and set up their own league, the Premier League. They eventually opted to agree a deal with Sky Sports rather than ITV or the BBC, meaning leading live top flight football was no longer available on terrestrial television. ITV continued to show second tier matches on a regional basis for a time and also later on its unsuccessful ITV Digital platform.\\n\\nthumbCoverage of Premier League now dominates football on English television, especially in financial terms; the contracts agreed between the league and broadcasters BSkyB in 1992 and 1997 were worth £191.5m and £670m respectively. Sky were also able to show more live games than previously, with several games live on many matchdays (originally Sundays and Mondays). However, the European Union objected to what it saw as a monopoly on television rights and demanded the 2007 contract be split into separate packages of 23 games; eventually Sky won four of the six available packages, with the other two were taken by Setanta Sports. Setanta went bankrupt in 2009 with its packages taken over by ESPN. From 2010/11, Sky have five packages and ESPN one. The top tier still has a presence on terrestrial television in highlights form on Match of the Day.. \\n\\nFrom the 2009/10 season, live coverage of the Football League returned to British terrestrial television for the first time since 2001 with the BBC securing 10 live Championship (second tier) games per season, as well as Football League highlights after Match of the Day. Sky also showed live lower league football while Setanta also showed large numbers of Conference games before the channels demise. \\n\\nThere is also extensive coverage of numerous Cup competitions. Every match in the Champions League (formerly European Cup) is available either on ITV or Sky Sports while ITV is also the primary broadcaster of the FA Cup with two live games per round while Sky and the BBC show the League Cup. Five, ITV and ESPN show the Europa League with even the Football League Trophy getting live television exposure on Sky Sports.\\n\\nThe Premier League holds an exclusive contract with broadcasters British Sky Broadcasting. Some public house install foreign satellite television decoders hardware to enable customers to watch live Premier League games in their establishment.\\n\\nThe Premier League believes that this is illegal under copyright law. The European Court of Justice is currently looking into whether the EU law on the free movement of goods should be applied to the decoder cards.\\n\\nKaren Murphy, a publican who had been prosecuted for using a Greek satellite provider at a public house in Portsmouth said: \"The fact is 297 is to prevent fraud and nothing to do with territorial fragmentation, and does not seek to protect the interests of the Premier League,\".\\n\\nMs Murphy was charged under s297(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA), in that on two occasions she: ‘… dishonestly received a programme included in a broadcasting service provided from a place in the United Kingdom with intent to avoid payment of any charge applicable to the reception of the programme.’\\n\\nEach weekend as many as five Premier League games will be moved to be shown on Sky Sports or ESPN. The main kick-off times for TV games are 12:45 and 5:30 pm on Saturdays, 1:30 and 4:00 pm on Sundays, and 8:00 pm on Mondays. Other games may also be moved to Sunday if one of the teams involved played in a Europa League fixture on a Thursday. \\n\\nSky will almost always show a Sunday 4 pm game, typically following a 1.30 pm kick off as part of a Super Sunday. Sky aim to show their best game of the weekend in the 4 pm slot, but police restrictions on local derbies mean this is not always possible. Premier League games scheduled for midweek may also be picked for live broadcast by Sky on Tuesday or Wednesday nights.\\n\\nESPN typically broadcast live Premier League games at 5.30 pm on the Saturday and/or 8 pm on Monday, while Sky typically broadcast a live Football League game at the same time. From the 2010/11 season, Sky will regain the rights to live Monday Night Premier League football. \\n\\nEach broadcaster is subjected to restrictions on the number of times they can show a team live per season to ensure fair distribution of TV revenue, after 1995-2000 seen 90 percent of Saturday games involving Manchester United.\\n\\nNo games kicking off at 3 pm on a Saturday, the traditional British kick-off time, may be broadcast live on television in Britain, with the exceptions of the FA Cup Final and the Scottish Cup Final. This is to ensure attendances at lower league games taking place at the same time as Premier League fixtures that might otherwise be broadcast on television. To avoid this blackout, the last day of the Premier League, when all ten games must kick off simultaneously, is always played on a Sunday. \\n\\nLive radio broadcasts are permitted, both nationally and locally; these may be simulcast on the internet, depending on the broadcaster. Viewers outside the UK can still watch these games live on foreign broadcasters, thus creating somewhat of a grey market within the UK with viewers able to subscribe to or watch streams of foreign channels. \\n\\nThe Premier League and Sky maintain that, while grey market viewing of games is not illegal on the part of the viewer, it is illegal for anyone (such as a public house) to make such services openly available. This has in the past lead to heavy fines for public houses in the United Kingdom which have shown 3:00 games in their establishments. More recently, the legality of such fines has been disputed, and a number of Crown Court cases have been reported in which publicans successfully challenged the Premier League's position.\\n\\nIn recent years, Sky Sports has shown 3 pm games on tape delay on their Football First show, either in full or as extended highlights. \\n\\nIt has been suggested the majority of Premier League fixtures may take place on a Sunday in the future to increase the value of TV rights.\\n\\n*TelevisionFootballTelevisionTelevision\\n\\n"}

At age 14, he met René Goscinny and with his encouragement applied his talent to comics. He produced work for Goscinny's comics magazine Pilote in the 1970s, publishing his first story, Le Bol Maudit, in 1972.\\n\\nIn 1975, Bilal began working with script writer Pierre Christin on a series of dark and surreal tales, resulting in the body of work titled Légendes d'Aujourd'hui.\\n\\nHe is best known for the Nikopol trilogy (La Foire aux Immortels, La Femme Piège and Froid Équateur), which took more than a decade to complete. Bilal wrote the script and did the artwork. The final chapter, Froid Équateur, was chosen book of the year by the magazine Lire and is acknowledged by the inventor of chess boxing, Iepe Rubingh as the inspiration for the sport. \\n\\nBilal's most recent publication is Quatre?

{"title": "Enoki class destroyer", "body": "The  was a class of six destroyer of the Imperial Japanese Navy.  As with the previous ''Momo''-class, all were named after trees. As Enoki and Nara were both commissioned on the same day, the class is also referred to as the Nara-class.\\n\\nWith most of Japan’s destroyers deployed to the Mediterranean Sea as part of Japan’s contribution to the war effort against Imperial Germany under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the Imperial Japanese Navy approached the Diet of Japan for an emergency procurement budget, similar to that awarded during the Russo-Japanese War for the production of the ''Kamikaze'' class destroyers. The funding was awarded from the fiscal 1917 budget, but mindful of the fact that the Kamikaze-class destroyers had not actually been completed until after the end of the previous war, the government stipulated that the emergency budget be used up within a six month period. \\n\\nThe order for six vessels was split between the four major naval shipyards: one to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, two to Kure Naval Arsenal, two to Sasebo Naval Arsenal and one to Maizuru Naval Arsenal  \\n\\nWith such a limited time frame to use its budget, the Japanese Navy could not afford the time to design a new ship. Therefore, the blueprint for the previous Momo-class destroyers were distributed to each shipyard, with the instructions that identical ships be produced, except with sturdier armor and bow construction. Experience with extended overseas deployment in World War I had taught the Japanese Navy that the construction of its destroyers needed to be reinforced to handle heavy seas. The result was a ship which looked physically almost exactly like the Momo-class, but was roughly 15 tons heavier in displacement. \\n\\nInternally, all six vessels used Brown-Curtis geared steam turbine engines, which could use either heavy oil or coal for propulsion. Armament was identical to the Momo-class, with three QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I – IV guns, pedestal mounted along the centerline of the vessel, front, mid-ship and to the stern and two triple torpedo launchers. \\n\\nThe Enoki-class destroyers served in the very final stages of World War I, where they were deployed mostly in local waters near the Japanese home islands. Enoki and Nara were converted to minesweepers on June 1, 1930. The remaining four vessels were retired on April 1, 1934.\\n\\n"}

Villanueva (born June 23, 1980 in Pasay City, Philippines), better known simply as Enrico Villanueva, and by the nicknames Raging Bull and E-Vill, is a Filipino professional basketball player for the Barangay Ginebra Kings in the Philippine Basketball Association. He is a former Most Valuable Player in the UAAP for his alma mater the Ateneo de Manila University in 2002.\\n\\nVillanueva first played for the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the UAAP Juniors division leading them to numerous winning seasons and championships. He moved to the college ranks in 1998 and led the Ateneo Blue Eagles to several final four appearances and two UAAP Finals appearances, eventually winning the basketball crown in 2002 over their rivals, the De La Salle Green Archers.\\n\\nHe also had several chances to win the Most Valuable Player award but lost to Don Allado (1999) and teammate Rich Alvarez (2000 and 2001) before finally winning it in his final season in 2002.\\n\\nIn the Philippine Basketball League, Villanueva began with Blu Detergent in 1999 before leading the Ateneo sponsored Hapee-NENACO team to the PBL title in 2002 over his former team Blu.\\n\\nIn 2003, Villanueva applied for the PBA Rookie Draft, in one of the deepest drafts in PBA history. He was eventually selected seventh overall by Batang Red Bull Thunder.\\n\\nHe had a limited role in his rookie season in 2003 with Red Bull with veterans Davonn Harp and Mick Pennisi playing the bigger roles. This continued during the 2004 Fiesta Conference when Red Bull claimed runner-up honors to Barangay Ginebra in the Finals.\\n\\nHowever, after Harp and Pennisi were shelved for failing to further prove their Filipino lineage (Pennisi has since returned to the league), Villanueva saw his playing time increase along with his production. Despite a sorry performance in the 2004-05 Philippine Cup, he managed to lead Red Bull to a fourth-place finish in the 2005 Fiesta Conference. By season's end, he was named as the Most Improved Player by the league and became the new face of the franchise.\\n\\nIn the 2005-06 season, Villanueva became a two-time All-Star representing the North All-Stars.

His team, Purefoods, was then forced to look for a legit center and turned to Villanueva to fill the void. In a four-team trade, Purefoods acquired Villanueva, sending energetic forward Marc Pingris to San Miguel (known as Magnolia at that time).\\n\\nVillanueva was a member of the Team Pilipinas, the RP team coached by Chot Reyes. He played for the country in the FIBA Asia Champions Cup 2005 and the 2005 Brunei Cup. He is remembered during the Champions Cup for pulling the leg of Sagesse Lebanon's Stephen Howard after an altercation, resulting in his ejection. He also suited up for the team again in the FIBA Asia Champions Cup 2007 and the Southeast Asia Basketball Association Championship 2007.\\n\\nVillanueva is vividly remembered for his on and off the court feud with San Miguel's Joseph Yeo.\\n\\nTheir feud began during the PBA-sanctioned Ateneo-La Salle Dream Games in December 2005, pitting past and present Ateneo and La Salle players in an exhibition game. The incident saw Yeo elbowed Villanueva at the forehead, resulting in Yeo's ejection from the game. Villanueva eventually hit the game-winner in that contest. At that time, Yeo was still an amateur playing for Harbour Centre in the Philippine Basketball League and since it was a PBA-sanctioned game, commissioner Noli Eala gave Yeo a three-month probation after being selected by Coke in the 2006 PBA Draft.\\n\\nAnother incident happened during a 2006 PBA preseason game at the Emilio Aguinaldo College Sports Center in Manila when both players were reportedly involved in a physical and verbal exchange. However, the league did not sanction both players.\\n\\nThe most recent came in a 2006-07 Philippine Cup game between Red Bull and Coca-Cola at the Araneta Coliseum. A physical exchange happened during the waning moments of the first half between both players. But after the game, a parking lot incident broke between Yeo and Villanueva. They were both sanctioned with fines by the commissioner and both players have since promised to end the feud.\\n\\nBarangay Ginebra traded Paul Artadi, Rafi Reavis, and the rights to 2009 8th pick overall Chris Timberlake for Enrico Villanueva, Rich Alvarez, Celino Cruz, and Paolo Bugia of Purefoods.

{"title": "Enrique Angelelli", "body": "thumbEnrique Ángel Angelelli (17 June 19234 August 1976) was a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina, killed during the last military dictatorship for his involvement with social issues.\\n\\nAngelelli, the son of Italian immigrants, was born in Córdoba and entered the seminary of Our Lady of Loreto at 15 years of age. He was then sent to Rome to finish his studies. He was ordained priest on 9 October 1949 and returned to Córdoba.\\n\\nHe started working in a parish, founded youth movements and visited Córdoba's slum. He focused his pastoral work on the conditions of the poor. Pope John XXIII appointed him auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Córdoba on 12 December 1960. He got involved in labor union conflicts and worked with other priests looking for a renewal of the Church, which caused him to be resisted. In 1964 he was removed from his post. That same year he took part in the Second Vatican Council.\\n\\nAngelelli gave his tacit authorization to the May 1968 first Encounter of the Movement of Priests for the Third World, although he never joined the movement himself.\\n\\nAfter four years, on 3 July 1968, Pope Paul VI appointed Angelelli bishop of the Diocese of La Rioja, in northwestern Argentina. \\n\\nIn La Rioja, Angelelli encouraged the creation of unions of miners, rural workers and domestic workers, as well as cooperative to manufacture knitting works, bricks, clocks and bread, and to claim and work idle lands. One of these cooperatives asked for the expropriation of a latifundio (large estate) that had grown through the appropriation of smaller estates as their owners could not pay up their debts. Governor Carlos Menem, promised he would deliver the estate to the cooperative. On 13 June 1973, Angelelli went to Anillaco, Menem's birthtown, to preside over the patronal feasts. He was received by a mob led by merchants and landowners, among them Amado Menem, the governor's brother, and his sons César and Manuel. The mob entered the church by force, and when Angelelli suspended the celebrations and left, they threw stones at him. Governor Menem withdrew his support to the cooperative on the basis of \"social unrest\". Angelelli denounced conservative groups, called off religious celebrations in the diocese, and declared a temporary interdict over the Menems and their supporters.\\n\\nThe Superior General of the Jesuits, Pedro Arrupe, and the Archdiocese of Santa Fe, Vicente Faustino Zazpe, sent by the Holy See as an overseer, visited La Rioja and supported Angelelli, who had offered his resignation and asked the Pope to ratify or withdrew his trust. Before Zazpe, the interdicted demanded for Angelelli's removal, while military marches where broadcast through a loudspeaker. Almost all priests of the diocese met with Zazpe to support Angelelli and told him that \"the powerful manipulated the faith to preserve an unjust and oppressed situation of the people\" and to take advantage of the \"cheap, underpaid workforce\".\\n\\nOn the other hand, the president of the Argentine Episcopal Conference, Adolfo Tortolo, said that the Conference should not mediate, and the Nuncio Lino Zanini openly supported the interdicted, to whom he gave crucifix as gifts.\\n\\nZazpe concluded his inspection with a joint mass with Angelelli and expressing his full support for his pastoral work and with regards to doctrine.\\n\\nThe short presidency of Isabel Martínez de Perón (1974-76) was marked by the beginning of the Dirty War, which soon escalated into bombings, kidnappings, torture and assassinations, triggering a persecution of left-wing views.\\n\\nOn 12 February 1976, the vicar of the diocese of La Rioja and two members of a social activist movement were arrested by the military. On 24 March, a coup d'état ousted Isabel Perón and all the nation's governors, including Carlos Menem of La Rioja (to whom Angelleli had earlier been a confessor). Angelleli petitioned General Osvaldo Pérez Battaglia, the new military interventor of La Rioja, for information on the vicar's and the activists' whereabouts. Getting no response, he travelled to Córdoba to speak to Luciano Benjamín Menéndez, then Commander of the Third Army Corps. Menéndez threateningly warned Angelelli: \"It is you who have to be careful.\" \\n\\nAngelelli allegedly knew that he was being targeted for assassination by the military; people close to him had heard him many times say \"It's my turn next.\" On 4 August 1976, he was driving a truck together with Father Arturo Pinto, back from a mass celebrated in the town of El Chamical in homage of two murdered priests, Carlos de Dios Murias and Gabriel Longueville, and carrying three folders with notes about both cases. \\n\\nAccording to Father Pinto, a car started following them, then another one, and in the place called Punta de los Llanos they forced the truck between them until toppling it. After staying unconscious for a while, Pinto saw Angelelli dead in the road, with the back of his neck showing grave injuries \"as if they had beaten him\".\\n\\nThe area was quickly surrounded by police and military personnel. An ambulance was sent for. Angelelli's body was taken to the city of La Rioja. The autopsy revealed several broken rib and a star-shaped fracture in the occipital bone, consistent with a blow given using a blunt object. The truck's brakes and steering wheel were intact, and there were no bullet marks.\\n\\nThe police report stated that Pinto had been driving, momentarily lost control of the vehicle, and when trying to get back on the road a tire blew out; Angelelli was said to have been killed as the truck turned several times. Judge Rodolfo Vigo accepted the report. A few days afterwards, prosecutor Martha Guzmán Loza recommended closing the case, calling it \"a traffic event\".\\n\\nOther bishops (Jaime de Nevares, Jorge Novak and Miguel Hesayne) called the event a murder, even during the dictatorship, but the rest of the Church kept silent.\\n\\nOn 19 June 1986, already under democratic rule, La Rioja judge Aldo Morales sentenced that it had been \"a homicide, coldly premeditated, and expected by the victim\". When some military became involved in the accusation, the Armed Forces tried to block the investigation, but the judge rejected their claims. The case passed to the Supreme Court, which in turn derived it to the Federal Chamber of Córdoba. The Córdoba tribunal said it was possible that the orders had come from Commander Menéndez of the Third Corps.\\n\\nIn April 1990, the Ley de Punto Final (\"Full Stop Law\") ended the investigation against the three military accused of the murder (José Carlos González, Luis Manzanelli and Ricardo Román Oscar Otero). This law and the Law of Due Obedience were repealed in 2005, and in August of that year the case was re-opened. The Supreme Court split the case in two: the accusation against the military was sent to the tribunals in Córdoba, and the possible participation of civilians in the murder was sent to La Rioja. Former Commander Menéndez was called on by the La Rioja tribunal on 16 May 2006 but chose not to declare anything.\\n\\nAfter the murder of Angelelli, the Catholic Church officially accepted the car accident story, though some of its members (as mentioned above) spoke against it. L'Osservatore Romano reported his death as \"a strange accident\", and Juan Carlos Aramburu denied it was a crime.\\n\\nTen years later, even after the sentence passed by Judge Morales in La Rioja, the hierarchy of the Church continued to avoid any references to murder. In 2001, a declaration emitted by the Argentine Episcopal Conference stated that \"[d]eath found him while fulfilling a difficult mission, accompany[ing] the communities hurt by the murder of their shepherds.\"\\n\\nOn 2 August 2006, two days before the 30th anniversary of Angelelli's death, President Néstor Kirchner signed a decree declaring 4 August a national day of mourning, and gave a speech in the Casa Rosada \"commemorating the religious workers [who were] victims of state terrorism\". Alba Lanzillotto, a member of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo who used to attend mass sung by bishop Angelelli, spoke then regarding the belated homage of the Catholic hierarchy: \"I don't want Monsignor to be made into a stamp. He has to be alive in our memory.\"\\n\\nOn the day of the anniversary, Jorge Bergoglio conducted mass in the Cathedral of La Rioja in memory of Angelelli. In his homily he claimed that Angelelli \"got stones thrown at him because he preached the Gospel, and shed his blood for it\", though he did not explicitly mention the involvement of the dictatorship in the crime. Bergoglio also quoted Tertullian's sentence \"[the] blood of the martyrs [is the] seed of the Church\". This was the first official homage of the Church to Angelelli, and the first time that the word martyr was used with reference to his murder by Church authorities in this context. After the mass, about 2,000 people (including the governor of La Rioja Ángel Maza) paid homage to Angelelli in Punta de los Llanos, the site of his death.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Enrique Telémaco Susini", "body": "rightEnrique Telémaco Susini (January 31, 1891 - July 4, 1972) was an Argentine entrepreneur and media pioneer.\\n\\nIn 1920, Susini led the effort for the first radio broadcast in Argentina, and subsequently established one of the earliest regular radio stations in the world. During the 1920s and 1930s, he became a successful entrepreneur in the nascent radio and film industry.\\n\\nBesides his business interests, Susini was an accomplished artist. He worked as director for theaters in Argentina and Italy and directed several movies produced by his own company, Lumiton.\\n\\nEnrique T. Susini was born in Buenos Aires as son of Dr. Telémaco Susini, professor of pathological anatomy at the University of Buenos Aires and the country's first otolaryngologist.In 1906, his father assumed the position of Argentine consul in the Austro-Hungarian capital of Vienna.This allowed young Susini, who had received his high-school diploma one year earlier at the age of 14to attend the Vienna conservatory, where he received formal training in singing and playing the violin. After briefly studying physics and chemistry in Berlin and Paris,he returned to Buenos Aires in 1909 to begin his medical studies at the faculty where his father had taught. In 1913, at the age of 22, he received his degree of medical doctor having written an award-winning thesis.\\n\\nAfter his graduation, he briefly worked as a journalist, helping to found the Asociación de la Crítica (Association of [theater] critics) in 1915. One year later, he joined the Argentine military, where he conducted research about the influence of electric and acoustic stimuli on the human body and set up a laboratory for veterinary vaccines.\\n\\nIn 1910, Guglielmo Marconi, winner of the previous year's Nobel Prize in Physics, had come to Argentina for the centennial festivities of the country's independence. During his stay, he used the opportunity to set up a telegraphic radio station in Bernal, from where he successfully transmitted messages to Canada and Ireland.The publicity generated by Marconi's visit helped to create a group of mostly young radio enthusiasts. Among these young people were Susini and a group of his friends from medical school.\\n\\nIn 1915, the community had become large and sophisticated enough for a newspaper article to mention that the radio amateurs \"formed a sort of fraternity, exchanging news, talking with each other over long distances, and even transmitting little piano or violin concerts over their connections.\"\\n\\nSusini, along with his nephew Miguel Mugica and his friends Cesar Guerrico and Luis Romero Carranza formed part of this community and took part in these first tentative steps. Soon they acquired the nickname Locos de la Azotea (\"the crazy people from the roof\"), because their hobby involved activities - sometimes bordering on the acrobatic - on top of tall buildings, where they mounted the long wire antennas required by early-type radios. During this time, the group first played with the idea to use radio as a means for cultural dissemination, a fact that Susini himself later ascribed to their shared passion for theater and music.\\n\\nAt the outbreak of the World War in Europe, radio communication had become a technology of great military significance, and its development accelerated considerably during the following years. However, most of this development took place in secret, and so the stream of bibliographical material and hardware from Europe to Argentina gradually dried up.\\n\\nIn this situation, Susini was offered a great opportunity resulting from his military experience. After the end of the war in late 1918, he was sent to France to study the effect of chemical warfare on the respiratory system. While conducting his research, he was able to procure radio communications hardware from the formerly belligerent armies, which he later smuggled back to Argentina.\\n\\nright\\n\\nAfter returning to Argentina in 1919, Susini started working on the conversion of an old circus site into the Teatro Coliseo theater. Together with his friends, he started planning for a radio transmission from there, strongly supported by the two Italian owners, Faustino da Rossa and Walter Mocchi.\\n\\nDuring 1920, while the group was working on the project, news reached them of Marconi's successful broadcast of a concert in New York that had taken place on May 19. Even though it was somewhat of a disappointment that their broadcast would not be the world's first, the preparations continued at a rapid pace.\\n\\nOn August 27, they were finally ready. The theatre was showing the opera Parsifal by Richard Wagner. Susini and his coworkers had set up a 5W transmitter on the roof, along with a wire antenna connected to the dome on top of a neighboring building. To pick up the sound in the theater, they used a microphone originally designed to aid people with hearing loss.\\n\\nAround 8:30 pm, Susini himself took the microphone and inaugurated regular radio broadcast service in Argentina with the words:\\n\\nThe transmission continued for about three hours and was received as far as Santos in Brazil, where it was picked up by a ship's radio operator. The number of listeners was limited, since the crystal set radios used at the time were rare and difficult to operate, requiring tedious fine-tuning of a lead glass crystal and installation of a wire antenna several meters long. But the newspaper La Razón published a raving review, and even president Hipólito Yrigoyen commended Susini and his group for their accomplishment.\\n\\nright\\n\\nDuring the next 19 days, the group continued to broadcast from the theater, transmitting mostly Italian operas such as Verdi's Aida and Rigoletto. After the season at the Teatro Coliseo was over, they started creating productions under their own name. By now they officially called their station \"Radio Argentina\". Radio Argentina would continue broadcasting until its demise on December 31, 1997.\\n\\nAt first, it was run solely by the four friends. The polyglot Susini himself performed songs in Spanish, French, German, Italian and Russian, assuming a different stage name each time so the listeners would not notice.\\n\\nDuring the following years, radio broadcasting in Argentina saw a quick expansion. In 1921, Buenos Aires mayor Juan Barnetche introduced official broadcasting licenses. In the same year, Radio Club Argentina was founded, becoming the first such association on American soil. In October 1922, Radio Argentina broadcast live from the inauguration of president Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, an historic first. Two months later, the first competitors arrived - Italian-owned Corporación Argentina de Radio Sud América, Radio Brusa and Radio Cultura, all three founded within an interval of three days.\\n\\nIn 1924, the radio industry in Argentina went through a brief crisis, during which Radio Argentina had to be financially supported by an association of industrialists named Asociación Argentina de Broadcasting.While competitor Radio Sud América went into bankruptcy, and was taken over by Radio Argentina, Radio Argentina itself survived, even though it had to briefly adopt the name of its benefactors. The station now broadcast from the famous Teatro Colón opera as well as from the (Tango-) Club Abdullah, and other venues. Adding to the variety of the schedule was Argentina's first regular radio journal.\\n\\n1925 saw the introduction of mandatory callsigns for radio stations, and from now on the station was known as LOR Radio Argentina (changed 1934 into LR2 Radio Argentina, it being the second station on the dial from the left). It also entered a collaboration with the daily newspaper Crítica, remaining under the direction of Susini and his friends but adopting the name\"LOR Broadcasting de Crítica\". This arrangement lasted a little more than a year, before the station returned to its original name and ownership.\\n\\nBy now, Susini and his partners were focusing on another project. Immediately after reacquiring the station from Crítica, they sold it to Radio Prieto, using the money to create a radiotelegraphy company, Sociedad Anónima Radio Argentina, constituted on August 31, 1927.\\n\\nThe company soon entered the market of short-wave radio communication between South America and Europe, receiving a \"concession for an international radio telegraphy service allowing direct communication between Spain and Argentina\" from the Spanish government.\\n\\nWith its relay stations in Paraguay, New York and Madrid,the company, operating under the brand name \"Vía Radiar\", had considerable financial success. Moving aggressively against competitors by reducing prices, it soon managed to control the majority of radio traffic between Argentina and Europe, in close cooperation with the Spanish administration's telegraph service.\\n\\nIn 1930, the company was sold to ITT for the very substantial sum of 200 million US Dollar. Susini and his friends remained on the board of directors under the new ownership.\\n\\nOne year later, Susini, by now married to singer Alicia Arderius, and his three companions founded the film company Lumiton (from Spanish luminosidad and tono: \"light\" and \"sound\"), which would become one of the major players during the following decade, known as the \"Golden Age of Argentine Cinema\".\\n\\nWith equipment bought during a trip to the United States, the four partners set up the most modern film studio in the country at the time, which included its own laboratory.The studio released its first film, Tres Berretines, on May 19, 1933. It was the second sound film in Argentina, preceded only by competitor Sono Film's Tango, released about three weeks earlier on April 27.Though officially credited collectively to \"Equipo Lumiton\", it had actually been directed by Susini himself.\\n\\nIn total, 99 films were released by the company with its trademark gong. Among the most notable was 1938 Venice Film Festival entry La chismosa, starring Lola Membrives, also directed by Susini himself.Lumiton continued producing feature films until 1957.\\n\\nEven while leading his various companies, Susini remained active in the cultural domain. He was in charge of Teatro Coliseo during several seasons in the 1920s, and served as technical director of the famous Teatro Colón. After setting in scene the opera Oberon in 1938 at the Teatro Reale in Rome to great critical acclaim, he was called to work as director at the Scala in Milan.\\n\\nLater he also worked at the \"Teatro Argentino de La Plata\". During his life, Susini authored more than seventy theater plays, receiving the National Culture Award in 1951 for his comedy En un viejo patio porteño (\"In an old Buenos Aires back yard\"). Furthermore, he was known as an excellent concert pianist.\\n\\nAlso in 1951, Susini returned to his roots as broadcast pioneer, working as director of photography during Argentina's first television broadcast on October 17.\\n\\nFinally, in 1962, Susini founded the cooperative phone company TELPIN in Pinamar, opening the way for a series of popular local phone companies in Argentina. TELPIN is still in business today as a modern telecommunications company offering a broad range of phone and internet services.\\n\\nAlthough he definitely did not perform the world's first radio broadcast, an honor that belongs to Enrico Marconi, Susini is often credited, especially in Argentine publications, with the establishment of the world's first regular radio broadcast service.\\n\\nA final evaluation of this claim is not easy, since there were many experimental audio broadcasts in various countries at the time. However, what remains certain is that Susini established the first radio broadcast station in South America on his personal initiative, overcoming serious difficulties in the process. Even though Susini himself has remained relatively unknown, even in his home country, the significance of his pioneering feat was acknowledged in 1970 by the establishment of August 27 as National Broadcast Day (Día de la Radiodifusión) in Argentina, annually celebrated by the country's radio stations.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ensoniq AudioPCI", "body": "rightThe Ensoniq AudioPCI is a PCI-based sound card released in 1997. It was Ensoniq's last sound card product before they were acquired by Creative Technology. The card represented a shift in Ensoniq's market positioning. Whereas the Soundscape line had been made up primarily of low-volume high-end products full of features, the AudioPCI was designed to be very simple, low-cost product to appeal to system OEM and thus hopefully sell in mass quantities.\\n\\nthumbTowards the end of the 1990s, Ensoniq was struggling financially. Their cards were very popular with PC OEM, but their costs were too high and their musical instrument division was fading in revenue. Pressure from intense competition, especially with the dominant Creative Labs, was forcing audio card makers to try to keep their prices low.\\n\\nThe AudioPCI, released in July 1997, was designed primarily to be cheap. In comparison to the wide variety of chips on and sheer size of the older Soundscape boards, the highly integrated two chip design of the AudioPCI is an obvious shift in design philosophy. The board consists only of a very small software-driven audio chip (one of the following: S5016, ES1370, ES 1371) and a companion digital-to-analog converter (DAC). In another cost-cutting move, the previously typical ROM chip used for wavetable patch set storage was replaced with the facility to use system RAM as storage for this audio data. This was made possible by the move to the PCI bus, with its far greater bandwidth and more efficient bus mastering interface when compared to the older ISA bus standard.\\n\\nAudioPCI, while designed to be cheap, is still quite functional. It offers many of the audio capabilities of the Soundscape ELITE card and surpasses the other Soundscape cards. Notably, AudioPCI supports several digital effects (reverb, chorus, and spatial enhancement) when used with Microsoft Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.\\n\\nAudioPCI had some surprises for the market. It was one of the first cards to have Microsoft DirectSound3D 4-speaker playback support. The 4-speaker mode is only activated by software supporting the DirectSound3D quadraphonic mode. An oddity is that the rear channel was connected to the same output jack as line input. The jack switches modes if 4-speaker output became active.\\n\\nThe DOS and Windows drivers support wavetable-synthesis through Ensoniq's \".ecw\" patch set format. Several patch set choices are available, varying in size and instrument quality (2, 4, or 8 MB). \\n\\nThe \".ecw\" file format (Ensoniq Concert Wavetable) was never made open as had been hoped for by enthusiasts. Consequently, there are very few custom wave sets available, in contrast to the huge availability of home-made releases in E-mu's SoundFont format. It was particularly unfortunate because the AudioPCI used system RAM for patch set storage which in itself offers tremendous potential for new patch sets over the traditional ROM storage previously used. It is also disappointing considering the incredible popularity and longevity of the Ensoniq ES1370 chipset and its descendants, some of which were still in use six years after the original AudioPCI board, and the fact that DOS drivers for the far newer Sound Blaster Audigy still use \".ecw\" wave sets. These newer cards are unable to use SoundFonts in DOS, limiting them to the three official .ecw wavesets from the late '90s and one incomplete unofficial waveset.\\n\\nThe AudioPCI boasted excellent DOS support for a PCI sound card. The competing Monster Sound from Diamond Multimedia was limited to running DOS games in Windows 9x-based DOS command windows, meaning DOS compatibility was frequently only reliable through an additional ISA sound card. Creative was struggling with the challenge of legacy support as well, and had created the SBLink, an interconnect between the card and their special port design included on many of the first PCI motherboards, in order to achieve DOS compatibility for their Sound Blaster AWE64-variant PCI sound cards. However, Ensoniq's DOS driver successfully simulated having a real Sound Blaster-compatible ISA sound card in the computer. Compatibility was achieved through the clever use of the PC's NMI and a TSR program that together virtualized the Sound Blaster hardware. This was a tremendous step forward for the time. However, the DOS driver required a memory manager such as EMM386 to be loaded, potentially reducing compatibility with games. This is not a requirement exclusive to AudioPCI, however, as a number of ISA sound cards used it as well, including the Creative AWE ISA series. \\n\\nThe AudioPCI DOS driver included Ensoniq Soundscape 16-bit digital audio and wavetable support, along with support for Sound Blaster Pro, AdLib Gold, General MIDI, and MT-32. However, without actual hardware for FM synthesis, FM music was simulated using the Ensoniq wavetable, resulting in FM soundtracks sounding inauthentic. DOS MIDI utilizes the same .ecw patch set files as Windows MIDI.\\n\\nPart of the deal when Ensoniq was purchased by Creative Labs was to integrate the AudioPCI DOS driver into the upcoming Sound Blaster Live!. Creative added Sound Blaster 16 emulation to the driver and removed the Ensoniq SoundScape support. AudioPCI itself was re-branded as several Creative Labs sound cards, including the Sound Blaster PCI 64, PCI 128, Vibra PCI, and others. The Ensoniq ES1370 audio chip was revised into AC'97-compliant variants, the ES1371 and ES1373, and used for several more years on card and as integrated motherboard audio.\\n\\nrightThe AudioPCI ES1370 sound chip was the next-generation in sound technology from the now defunct technology company Ensoniq. One of the more important innovations found within was the move from ISA to the PCI bus. It was one of the first sound card solutions to offer full MS-DOS legacy compatibility. When paired with a capable codec, such as the AK4531 (pre-AC'97), the ES1370 supported the then-latest in 3D audio positioning through 4-speaker surround sound. The chip was also a PCI bus master device that was designed to provide high-speed access to system RAM and resources, for wavetable data and effect processing. Depending on the drivers, it may also be called the Sound Blaster 64/128 in the device manager.\\n\\nES1370 was one of the first audio chips to support the Microsoft DirectSound3D audio API. When programs took full advantage of the API's capabilities, the ES1370 was capable of both global spatial and localized 3D sound effects, in both 2 and 4-speaker mode. The chip was capable of spatializing all audio automatically, but still required DirectSound3D usage for specific localization of sounds.\\n\\nThe ES1370 is also emulated as a piece of virtual hardware in Qemu and VMware.\\n\\nright/Creative ES1371 and ES1373 (AudioPCI 97) are AC'97-compatible versions.\\n\\n"}

The Symphypleona are very round animals, almost spherical. The Poduromorpha are also very plump but have a more oval shape. Entomobryomorpha, by contrast, contain the slimmest springtails. They either have short legs and antenna but their long body sets them apart, or long legs and antennae as well as a well-developed furcula; these are the most characteristic members of the order.\\n\\nThe Entomobryomorpha were, as Entomobryoidea, united with the Poduromorpha (then called Poduroidea) in a group called \"Arthropleona\", but this has more recently turned out to be paraphyletic. Actually the Entomobryomorpha, the Poduromorpha, and the third springtaill lineage – the Symphypleona – are equally distinct from each other. Their treatment at equal taxonomic rank reflects this.

{"title": "Environmental design", "body": "Environmental design is the process of addressing surrounding environmental parameters when devising plans, programs, policies, buildings, or products. Classical prudent design may have always considered environmental factors; however, the environmental movement beginning in the 1940s has made the concept more explicit.\\n\\nEnvironmental design can also refer to the applied arts and sciences dealing with creating the human-designed environment. These fields include architecture, city planning (or urban planning), landscape architecture, and interior design. Environmental design can also encompass interdisciplinary areas such as historical preservation and lighting design. In terms of a larger scope, environmental design has implications for the industrial design of products: innovative automobiles, wind-electricity generators, solar-electric equipment, and other kinds of equipment could serve as examples. Currently, the term has expanded to apply to ecological and sustainability issues.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe first traceable concepts of environmental designs focused primarily on solar heating, which began in Ancient Greece around 500 BCE. At the time, most of Greece had exhausted its supply of wood for fuel, leading architects to design houses that would capture the solar energy of the sun. The Greeks understood that the position of the sun varies throughout the year. For a latitude of 40 degrees in summer the sun is high in the south, at an angle of 70 degrees at the zenith, while in winter, the sun travels a lower trajectory, with a zenith of 26 degrees. Greek houses were built with south-facing façades which received little to no sun in the summer but would receive full sun in the winter, warming the house. Additionally, the southern orientation also protected the house from the colder northern winds. This clever arrangement of buildings influenced the use of the grid pattern of ancient cities. With the North-South orientation of the houses, the streets of Greek cities mainly ran East-West.\\n\\nThe practice of solar architecture continued with the Romans, who similarly had deforested much of their native Italian Peninsula by the first century BCE. The Roman heliocaminus, literally 'solar furnace', functioned with the same aspects of the earlier Greek houses. The numerous public baths were oriented to the south. Roman architects added glass to windows to allow for the passage of light and to conserve interior heat as it could not escape. The Romans also used greenhouses to grow crops all year long and to cultivate the exotic plants coming from the far corners of the Empire. Pliny the Elder wrote of greenhouses that supplied the kitchen of the Emperor Tiberius during the year.\\n\\nAlong with the solar orientation of buildings and the use of glass as a solar heat collector, the ancients knew other ways of harnessing solar energy. The Greeks, Romans and Chinese developed curved mirrors that could concentrate the sun's rays on an object with enough intensity to make it burn in seconds. The solar reflectors were often made of silver, copper or polished brass.\\n\\nEarly roots of modern environmental design began in the late 19th Century with writer/designer William Morris, who rejected the use of industrialized materials and processes in wallpaper, fabrics and books his studio produced. He and others, such as John Ruskin felt that the industrial revolution would lead to harm done to nature and workers.\\n\\nThe narrative of Phil Cousineau's documentary film Ecological Design: Inventing the Future asserts that in the decades after World War II, \"The world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry.\" From the middle of the twentieth century, thinkers like Buckminster Fuller have acted as catalysts for a broadening and deepening of the concerns of environmental designers. Nowadays, energy efficiency, appropriate technology, organic horticulture and agriculture, land restoration, New Urbanism, and ecologically sustainable energy and waste systems are recognized considerations or options and may each find application.\\n\\nBy integrating renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, and even geothermal energy into structures, it is possible to create zero emission buildings, where energy consumption is self-generating and non-polluting. It is also possible to construct \"energy-plus buildings\" which generate more energy than they consume, and the excess could then be sold to the grid. In the United States, the LEED Green Building Rating System rates structures on their environmental sustainability.\\n\\nExamples of the environmental design process include use of roadway noise computer models in design of noise barriers and use of roadway air dispersion models in analyzing and designing urban highways. Designers consciously working within this more recent framework of philosophy and practice seek a blending of nature and technology, regarding ecology as the basis for design. Some believe that strategies of conservation, stewardship, and regeneration can be applied at all levels of scale from the individual building to the community, with benefit to the human individual and local and planetary ecosystems.\\n\\nSpecific examples of large scale environmental design projects include:\\n\\nEnergy-efficient Buildings & Design:\\n\\nEnergy Usage (Commercial, Residential, Societal):\\n\\nLand Use & Community Planning\\n\\nOrganizations\\n\\nUrban Ecology\\n\\nPrevention of Crime\\n\\nWaste Treatment Innovation:\\n\\nOther related topics\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Environmental journalism", "body": "Environmental journalism is the collection, verification, production, distribution and exhibition of information regarding current events, trends, issues and people that are associated with the non-human world with which humans necessarily interact. To be an environmental journalist, one must have an understanding of scientific language and practice, knowledge of historical environmental events, the ability to keep abreast of environmental policy decisions and the work of environmental organizations, a general understanding of current environmental concerns, and the ability to communicate all of that information to the public in such a way that it can be easily understood, despite its complexity.\\n\\nEnvironmental journalism falls within the scope of environmental communication, and its roots can be traced to nature writing. One key controversy in environmental journalism is a continuing disagreement over how to distinguish it from its allied genres and disciplines.\\n\\nWhile the practice of nature writing has a rich history that dates back at least as far as the exploration narratives of Christopher Columbus, and follows tradition up through prominent nature writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau in the late 19th century, John Burroughs and John Muir in the early 20th century, and Aldo Leopold in the 1940s, the field of environmental journalism did not begin to take shape until the 1960s and 1970s.\\n\\nThe growth of environmental journalism as a profession roughly parallels that of the environmental movement, which became a mainstream cultural movement with the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962 and was further legitimized by the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964. Grassroots environmental organizations made a booming appearance on the political scene in the 1960s and 1970s, raising public awareness of what many considered to be the “environmental crisis,” and working to influence environmental policy decisions. The mass media has followed and generated public interest on environmental issues ever since.\\n\\nThe field of environmental journalism was further legitimized by the creation of the Society of Environmental Journalists  in 1990, whose mission “is to advance public understanding of environmental issues by improving the quality, accuracy, and visibility of environmental reporting.” Today, academic programs are offered at a number of institutions to train budding journalists in the rigors, complexity and sheer breadth of environmental journalism.\\n\\nThere exists a minor rift in the community of environmental journalists. Some, including those in the Society of Environmental Journalists, believe in objectively reporting environmental news, while others, like Michael Frome, a prominent figure in the field, believe that journalists should only enter the environmental side of the field if saving the planet is a personal passion, and that environmental journalists should not shy away from environmental advocacy, though not at the expense of clearly relating facts and opinions on all sides of an issue. This debate is not likely to be settled soon, but with changes in the field of journalism filtering up from new media being used by the general public to produce news, it seems likely that the field of environmental journalism will lend itself more and more toward reporting points of view akin to environmental advocacy.\\n\\nEnvironmental communication is all of the forms of communication that are engaged with the social debate about environmental issues and problems.\\n\\nAlso within the scope of environmental communication are the genres of nature writing, science writing, environmental literature, environmental interpretation and environmental advocacy. While there is a great deal of overlap among the various genres within environmental communication, they are each deserving of their own definition.\\n\\nNature writing is the genre with the longest history in environmental communication. In his book, This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing, Thomas J. Lyon attempts to use a “taxonomy of nature writing” in order to define the genre. He suggests that his classifications, too, suffer a great deal of overlap and intergrading. “The literature of nature has three main dimensions to it: natural history information, personal responses to nature, and philosophical interpretation of nature” (Lyon 20). In the natural history essay, “the main burden of the writing is to convey pointed instruction in the facts of nature,” such as with the ramble-type nature writing of John Burroughs (Lyon 21). “In essays of experience, the author’s firsthand contact with nature is the frame for the writing,” as with Edward Abbey’s contemplation of a desert sunset (Lyon 23). In the philosophical interpretation of nature, the content is similar to that of the natural history and personal experience essays, “but the mode of presentation tends to be more abstract and scholarly” (Lyon 25). The Norton Book of Nature Writing adds a few new dimensions to the genre of nature writing, including animal narratives, garden essays, farming essays, ecofeminist works, writing on environmental justice, and works advocating environmental preservation, sustainability and biological diversity. Environmental journalism pulls from the tradition and scope of nature writing.\\n\\nScience writing is writing that focuses specifically on topics of scientific study, generally translating jargon that is difficult for those outside a particular scientific field to understand into language that is easily digestible. This genre can be narrative or informative. Not all science writing falls within the bounds of environmental communication, only science writing that takes on topics relevant to the environment. Environmental journalism also pulls from the tradition and scope of science writing.\\n\\nEnvironmental interpretation is a particular format for the communication of relevant information. It “involves translating the technical language of a natural science or related field into terms and ideas that people who aren’t scientists can readily understand. And it involves doing it in a way that’s entertaining and interesting to these people” (Ham 3). Environmental interpretation is pleasurable (to engage an audience in the topic and inspire them to learn more about it), relevant (meaningful and personal to the audience so that they have an intrinsic reason to learn more about the topic), organized (easy to follow and structured so that main points are likely to be remembered) and thematic (the information is related to a specific, repetitious message) (Ham 8–28). While environmental journalism is not derived from environmental interpretation, it can employ interpretive techniques to explain difficult concepts to its audience.\\n\\nEnvironmental literature is writing that comments intelligently on environmental themes, particularly as applied to the relationships between man, society and the environment. Most nature writing and some science writing falls within the scope of environmental literature. Often, environmental literature is understood to espouse care and concern for the environment, thus advocating a more thoughtful and ecologically sensitive relationship of man to nature. Environmental journalism is partially derived from environmental literature\\n\\nEnvironmental advocacy is presenting information on nature and environmental issues that is decidedly opinionated and encourages its audience to adopt more environmentally sensitive attitudes, often more biocentric worldviews. Environmental advocacy can be present in any of the aforementioned genres of environmental communication. It is currently debated whether environmental journalism should employ techniques of environmental advocacy.\\n\\nThe field of environmental journalism covers a wide variety of topics. According to The Reporter’s Environmental Handbook, environmental journalists perceive water concerns as the most important environmental issue, followed by atmospheric air pollution concerns, endocrine disruptors, and waste management issues. The journalists surveyed were more likely to prioritize specific, local environmental issues than global environmental concerns.\\n\\nEnvironmental journalism can include, but is not limited to, some of the following topics:\\n\\nFrom The Reporter’s Environmental Handbook:\\n\\nFrom EnviroLink:\\n\\nJournalism\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ephebophilia", "body": "thumb\\n\\nEphebophilia is the sexual preference of adults for mid-to-late adolescents, generally ages 15 to 19. The term was originally used in the late 19th to mid 20th century, and has been more recently revisited by Ray Blanchard. It is one of a number of sexual preferences across age groups subsumed under the technical term \"chronophilia\". Ephebophilia strictly denotes the preference for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners, not the mere presence of some level of sexual attraction. In sexual ethics, it may be defined as a sexual preference for girls generally 14–16 years old, and boys generally 14–19 years old. Some authors define ephebophilia as a sexual preference of pubescent and adolescent boys.\\n\\nIn research environments, specific terms are used for chronophilias: for instance, ephebophilia to refer to the sexual preference for mid-to-late adolescents, hebephilia to refer to the sexual preference for earlier pubescent individuals, and pedophilia to refer to the sexual preference for prepubescent child. However, the term pedophilia is commonly used to refer to any sexual interest in minors below the legal age of consent, regardless of their level of physical, mental, or psychological development. Acting upon ephebophilic preference can be illegal, for example, when the adolescent is below the legal age of consent (e.g. statutory rape).\\n\\nThe term comes from the  (ephebos) variously defined as \"one arrived at puberty\", \"a youth of eighteen who underwent his dokimasia and was registered as a citizen (Athens)\", and \"arriving at man's estate;\" and φιλία (-philia) \"love\". It has been used by Dutch psychologist Frits Bernard as far back as 1950, reprinted in 1960 in the gay support magazine Vriendschap under the pseudonym Victor Servatius, also crediting it to Hirschfeld though giving no exact date. \\n\\nThe term has been described by Frenchman Félix Buffière in 1980 and Pakistan scholar Tariq Rahman, who argued that \"ephebophilia\" should be used in preference to \"homosexuality\" when describing the aesthetic and erotic interest of adult men in adolescent boys in classical Persian, Turkish or Urdu literature.\\n\\nBecause most late adolescents have physical characteristics near (or in other cases, identical) to that of full-grown adults, some level of sexual attraction to persons in the age group is common among adults of all sexual orientation. The term ephebophilia is used only to describe the preference for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners, not the mere presence of some level of sexual attraction. Such a distinct preference for individuals in mid or late adolescence is not generally regarded by psychologist as a pathology when it does not interfere with other major areas of one's life. Ephebophilia is not listed by name as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), or the ICD-10, nor is it listed as a paraphilia. This is as opposed to pedophilia, which is categorized as a specific disorder in those systems with its own diagnostic criteria. However, ephebophilia can sometimes be diagnosed as a disorder if it results in dysfunction or exploitative behavior, either under the DSM specification 309.2, \"Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified\", or under the ICD-10 F65.8 \"Other disorders of sexual preference\".\\n\\nResearchers state that hebephilia, erotic interest which centers on pubescents, has not come into widespread use, even among professionals who work with sex offenders, and may have been confused with the term ephebophilia, \"which denotes men who prefer adolescents around 15–19 years of age\". It is concluded that \"few would want to label erotic interest in late or even mid adolescents as a psychopathology, so the term hebephilia may have been ignored along with ephebophilia\".\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Epicenter", "body": "240px\\n\\nThe epicenter or epicentre is the point on the Earth's surface that is directly above the hypocenter or focus, the point where an earthquake or underground explosion originates. The word derives from the New Latin noun epicentrum the romanization of the Greek adjective ἐπίκεντρος (epikentros), \"occupying a cardinal point, situated on a centre\", from ἐπί (epi) \"on, upon, at\" and κέντρον (kentron) \"centre\".\\n\\nIn the case of earthquakes, the epicenter is directly above the point where the fault begins to rupture, and in most cases, it is the area of greatest damage. However, in larger events, the length of the fault rupture is much longer, and damage can be spread across the rupture zone. For example, in the magnitude 7.9, 2002 Denali earthquake in Alaska, the epicenter was at the western end of the rupture, but the greatest damage occurred about 330 km away at the eastern end of the rupture zone.\\n\\nDuring an earthquake seismic wave propagate spherically out from the hypocenter. Seismic shadowing occurs on the opposite side of the Earth from the earthquake epicenter because the liquid outer core refracts the longitudinal or compressional (P-wave) while it absorbs the transverse or shear waves (S-wave). Outside of the seismic shadow zone both types of wave can be detected but, due to their different paths through the Earth, they arrive at different times. By measuring the time difference on any seismograph as well as the distance on a travel-time graph at which the P-wave and S-wave have the same separation, geologists can calculate the distance to the earthquake's epicenter. This distance is called the epicentral distance, commonly measured in &deg; (degrees) and denoted as Δ (delta) in seismology.\\n\\nOnce epicentral distances have been calculated from at least three seismographic measuring stations, it is a simple matter to find out where the epicenter was located using trilateration.\\n\\nEpicentral distance is also used in calculating seismic magnitudes developed by Richter and Gutenberg.\\n\\n"}

From the late eighth century BC, there were three archons, the archon eponymous, the polemarch (replaced in 501 BC by ten strategoi), and the archon basileus (the ceremonial remnant of the Athenian monarchy). These positions were filled from the aristocracy (the Eupatridae) by elections every ten years. During this period Archon Eponymous was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements. \\n\\nAfter 508 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the archon eponymous. The archon eponymous was the chief archon, and presided over meetings of the Boule and Ecclesia, the ancient Athenian assemblies. The archon eponymous remained the titular head of state even under the democracy, though with much reduced political importance. Under the reforms of Solon, himself archon eponymous in 594 BC, there was a brief period during which the number of archons rose to ten. After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the Areopagus, though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time. \\n\\nOne of the archons oversaw the procedure for ostracism after 487 BC. An archon's court was in charge of epikleroi. Other duties of the archons included supervising the Panathenaea and Dionysia.\\n\\nIn the following list of Archons, years where the name of the archon is unknown are identified as such. Years listed as \"anarchy\" mean that there was literally \"no archon\". There are various conflicting reconstructions of lists; sources for this list are given at the end. Note that the term of an archon covered two of our years, beginning in the spring or summer and continuing into the next spring or summer. The polemarch or strategoi, basileus, and thesmothetai (the six assistants to the archons) are also listed, where known.\\n\\nThe later Athenian tradition varies on the exact position of this line; they held archonship for life, and exercised the sacral powers of kingship, as did the archon basileus later. The historicity of any of this list may be reasonably doubted. \\n\\nIn 753 BC the perpetual archonship (essentially a kingship, see Kings of Athens) was limited to 10 years (the \"decennial archons\"):\\n\\nAfter 683 BC the archonship was limited to one year.

After graduating from the New Baltimore Academy, he taught school for three years, then studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1843, commencing practice in Brentsville, Virginia. He became prominent as a colonel, and later brigadier general, in the Virginia militia and as a Commonwealth attorney for Prince William County (1849–1861). \\n\\nIn 1848, Hunton was married to Lucy Caroline Weir (February 20, 1825 – September 4, 1899), daughter of Robert and Clara Boothe Weir. They had two children:\\n\\nTheir second child, Eppa Hunton III, went on to co-found the notable Richmond law firm Hunton & Williams in 1901. In 1977, the firm established the Eppa Hunton IV Memorial Book Award at the University of Virginia's School of Law, in honor of Hunton's grandson, who lived from July 31, 1904 to November 23, 1976. According to the University, the award is \"presented annually to a third-year student who has demonstrated unusual aptitude in litigation courses and shown a keen awareness and understanding of the lawyer's ethical and professional responsibility.\"\\n\\nHunton also appears to have had a child with a female slave, Henrietta. This child, John, was born on November 5, 1854.\\n\\nIn February 1861, Hunton was a delegate to the Virginia Secession Convention, and advocated secession. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, he was commissioned a colonel of the 8th Virginia Infantry of the Confederate Army, participating in the First Battle of Bull Run in July. In October his regiment was part of Nathan G. Evans' brigade near Leesburg, Virginia, where he led his command against a Union force at Ball's Bluff, driving it into the Potomac River. \\n\\nAfterward, Hunton held brigade command in Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's corps, Maj. Gen. George Pickett's division, and the Department of Richmond, being promoted to brigadier general in August 1863, after the Battle of Gettysburg. During Pickett's Charge, Hunton was wounded in the leg. After service in the defenses of Richmond, he rejoined Pickett's division and fought at Cold Harbor and in the Richmond and Petersburg siege lines. In March 1865 his command fought a delaying action at Five Forks and again the following month at Battle of Sayler's Creek, where he was captured on April 6, 1865. He was paroled at Fort Warren, Massachusetts, on July 24.\\n\\nAfter the war Hunton resumed his former law practice and became involved in politics. He was elected as a Democrat from Virginia to the 43rd and the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1873 – March 3, 1881). During his years as a Representative, Hunton was chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions (44th Congress), and of the Committee on the District of Columbia (46th Congress). He was appointed to the 15-member Electoral Commission created by an act of Congress in 1877 to decide the contests in various States in the presidential election of 1876.\\n\\nHunton was not a candidate for renomination in 1880, instead resuming the practice of law. He was appointed and subsequently elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John S. Barbour, and served from May 28, 1892, to March 3, 1895. Hunton served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee to Establish a University of the United States from 1893-1895.\\n\\nOn or about April 1, 1894, Hunton became indirectly involved in voting bribery attempts. Charles W. Buttz, a lobbyist and claim agent originally from North Dakota, but living in Washington, D.C. at the time, went to Hunton's house in Warrenton, Virginia, during the Senator's absence. Buttz told Hunton's son, Eppa III, that he would pay him a contingent fee of $25,000 if he would, by presenting arguments as to the pending tariff bill, induce his father to vote against it.

{"title": "Equivalent width", "body": "thumb\\n\\nThe equivalent width of a spectral line is a measure of the area of the line on a plot of intensity versus wavelength. It is found by forming a rectangle with a height equal to that of continuum emission, and finding the width such that the area of the rectangle is equal to the area in the spectral line. It is a measure of the strength of spectral features that is primarily used in astronomy.\\n\\nFormally, the equivalent width is given by the equation\\n\\n.\\n\\nHere,  represents the continuum intensity on either side of the absorption (or emission) feature, while  represents the intensity across the entire wavelength range of interest. Then  represents the width of a hypothetical line which drops to an intensity of zero and has the \"same integrated flux deficit from the continuum as the true one.\" This equation can be applied to either emission or absorption, but when applied to emission, the value of  is negative, and so the absolute value is used.\\n\\nThe equivalent width is used as a quantitative measure of the strength of spectral features. The equivalent width is a convenient choice because the shapes of spectral features can vary depending upon the configuration of the system which is producing the lines. For instance, the line may experience Doppler broadening due to motions of the gas emitting the photons. The photons will be shifted away from the line center, thus rendering the height of the emission line a poor measure of its overall strength. The equivalent width, on the other hand, \"measures the fraction of energy removed from the spectrum by the line,\" regardless of the broadening intrinsic to the line or a detector with poor resolution. Thus the equivalent width can in many conditions yield the number of absorbing or emitting atoms.\\n\\nFor example, measurements of the equivalent width of the Balmer alpha transition in T Tauri star are used in order to classify individual T Tauri stars as being classical or weak-lined. The equivalent width is also be used in studying star formation in Lyman alpha galaxies, as the equivalent width of the Lyman alpha line is related to the star formation rate in the galaxy. The equivalent width is also used in many other situations where a quantitative comparison between line strengths is needed. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Erhu", "body": "The erhu (), also called nanhu (南胡, \"southern fiddle\"), and sometimes known in the West as the \"Chinese violin\" or \"Chinese two-string fiddle,\" is a two-stringed bowed musical instrument, used as a solo instrument as well as in small ensembles and large orchestras. It is the most popular instrument in the huqin family of Chinese bowed string instruments, together with the zhonghu, gaohu, banhu, jinghu, sihu, and numerous others. Used in both traditional and contemporary pieces, it is a versatile instrument.\\n\\nThe erhu can be traced back to instruments introduced into China more than a thousand years ago. It is believed to have evolved from the xiqin (奚琴), which was described as a foreign, two-stringed lute in Yue Shu (樂書, yuèshū, lit. book of music), an encyclopedic work on music written by music theorist Chen Yang in the Northern Song Dynasty. The xiqin is believed to have originated from the Xi people of Central Asia, and have come to China in the 10th century.thumb\\n\\nThe first Chinese character of the name of the instrument (二, èr, two) is believed to come from the fact that it has two strings. An alternate explanation states that it comes from the fact that it is the second highest huqin in pitch to the gaohu in the modern Chinese orchestra. The second character (胡, hú) indicates that it is a member of the huqin family. The name huqin literally means \"barbarian instrument,\" showing that the instrument likely originated from regions to the north or west of China inhabited by non-Han peoples.\\n\\nHistoric bowed zither of China, including the xiqin, yazheng, and yaqin, and also the Korean ajaeng, were originally played by bowing with a rosin stick, which created friction against the strings. As soon as the horsehair bow was invented, it spread very widely. This is a high pitched instrument. The Central Asian horse peoples occupied a territory that included the Silk Road, along which goods and innovations were transported rapidly for thousands of miles across Eurasia.\\n\\nThe erhu consists of a long vertical stick-like neck, at the top of which are two large tuning peg, and at the bottom is a small resonator body (sound box) which is covered with python skin on the front (playing) end. Two strings are attached from the pegs to the base, and a small loop of string (qian jin) placed around the neck and strings acting as a nut pulls the strings towards the skin, holding a small wooden bridge in place.\\n\\nthumb erhu has some unusual features. First is that its characteristic sound is produced through the vibration of the python skin by bowing. Second, there is no fingerboard; the player stops the strings by pressing their fingertips onto the strings without the strings touching the neck. Third, the horse hair bow is never separated from the strings (which were formerly of twisted silk but which today are usually made of metal); it passes between them as opposed to over them (the latter being the case with western bowed stringed instruments). Lastly, although there are two strings, they are very close to each other and the player's left hand in effect plays as if on one string.The inside string (nearest to player) is generally tuned to D4 and the outside string to A4, a fifth higher. The maximum range of the instrument is three and a half octaves, from D4 up to A7, before a stopping finger reaches the part of the string in contact with the bow hair. The usual playing range is about two and a half octaves. \\n\\nVarious dense and heavy hardwoods are used in making the erhu. According to Chinese references the woods include zi tan (紫檀 red sandalwood and other woods of the genus Pterocarpus such as padauk), lao hong mu (老红木 aged red wood), wu mu (乌木 black wood), and hong mu (红木 red wood). Particularly fine erhus are often made from pieces of old furniture. A typical erhu measures 81 cm from top to bottom, the length of the bow also being 81 cm.thumb\\n\\nThe parts of the erhu:\\n\\nMost erhu are mass produced in factories. The three most esteemed centres of erhu making are Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou. In the collectivist period after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, these factories were formed by merging what had been previously private workshops. Although most erhu were machine-made in production lines, the highest quality instruments were hand made by specialist craftsmen. \\n\\nIn the 20th century, there have been attempts to standardize and improve the erhu, with the aim of producing a louder and better sounding instrument. One major change was the use of steel strings instead of silk. The move to steel strings was made gradually. By 1950, the thinner A string had been replaced by a violin E string with the thicker D string remaining silk. By 1958, professional players were using purpose made D and A steel erhu strings as standard.thumb\\n\\nIn 1988, China passed its Law on the Protection of Endangered Species after ratifying the UN Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), making it illegal to use and trade unlicensed pythons. To regulate the use of python skins, China's State Forestry Administration introduced a certification scheme between python skin sellers in Southeast Asia and musical instrument makers in China. From January 1, 2005, new regulations also require erhus to have a certificate from the State Forestry Administration, which certify that the erhu python skin is not made with wild pythons, but from farm-raised pythons. Individuals are allowed to take up to two erhus out of China when traveling; commercial buyers need additional export certificates.\\n\\nOutside China, manufacturers of erhu are able to issue their own CITES licenses with approval by governments of their respective countries. Such exports are legal as they have been made from legal skin sources.\\n\\nSome erhus are made of recycled products.\\n\\nA notable composer for the erhu was Liu Tianhua (刘天华/劉天華; Liú Tiānhuá) (1895-1932), a Chinese musician who studied Western music as well. He composed 47 exercises and 10 solo pieces (1918-32) which were central to the development of the erhu as a solo instrument. His works for the instrument include Yue Ye (月夜; Yuè yè, Moon Night) and Zhu ying Yao hong (烛影摇红; Zhú yǐng yáo hóng, Shadows of Candles Flickering Red).\\n\\nOther solo pieces include Er Quan Ying Yue (1950, Moon Reflected on Second Spring) by A Bing, Sai Ma (Horse Race) by Huang Haihuai, Henan Xiaoqu (Henan folk tune) by Liu Mingyuan, and Sanmenxia Changxiangqu (1961, Sanmen Gorge Capriccio) by Liu Wenjin. Most solo works are commonly performed with yangqin accompaniment, although pieces such as the ten solos by Liu Tianhua and Er Quan Ying Yue originally did not have accompaniment. \\n\\nIn addition to the solo repertoire, the erhu is also one of the main instruments in regional music ensembles such as Jiangnan sizhu, Chinese opera ensembles, and the modern large Chinese orchestra.\\n\\nThe erhu is also used in the music of the Cirque du Soleil show O. Even fusion progressive rock groups like The Hsu-nami have incorporated the erhu into their music and it is their lead instrument. It is also incorporated in the Taiwanese black metal band ChthoniC. The Erhu is also used in the song Field Below by Regina Spektor.\\n\\nAn Erhu instrumental album Along the River During the Qingming Festival (清明上河图;Qingming Shanghe tu) was issued at Nov 22nd 2006,Performed by a famous youth erhu artist Song Fei (宋飞; Song Fei),to express a picture draw in the Song Dynasty by Zhang Zeduan (张择端; Zhang Zeduan),the play was performed by Erhu,Jinghu,Banhu,Gaohu etc. to show the Livelihood,Trade,Festival of the Song Dynasty,the album contains 18 parts.The album represented the greatest achievement of Chinese classical music and it made the China's modern national landmark music works.\\n\\nThe erhu (played by George Gao) is also featured prominently in the soundtrack for the TV series Earth: Final Conflict.\\n\\nIn 2009's Star Trek soundtrack by Michael Giacchino, an erhu solo is featured in the soundtrack \"That New Car Smell.\"\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe erhu is almost always tuned to the interval of a fifth. The inside string (nearest to player) is generally tuned to D4 and the outside string to A4. This is the same as the two middle strings of the violin.\\n\\nThe erhu is played sitting down, with the sound box placed on the top of the left thigh and the neck held vertically.\\n\\nThe bow is held with an underhand grip. The bow hair is adjusted so it is slightly loose. Tension is provided by the fingers of the right hand. The bow hair is placed in between the two strings and both sides of the bow hair are used to produce sound, the player pushes the bow away from the body when bowing the A string (the outside string), and pulls it inwards when bowing the \"inside\" D string. \\n\\nAside from the usual bowing technique used for most pieces, the erhu can also be plucked, usually using the second finger of the right hand. This produces a dry, muted tone (if either of the open strings is plucked, the sound is somewhat more resonant) which is sometimes desired in contemporary pieces.\\n\\nThe left hand alters the tone of the strings by pressing on the string at the normal harmonic points. As the instrument has no frets, the tone is slightly muddled, but resonant.Techniques include hua yin (slides), rou xian (vibrato), huan ba (changing positions), etc.\\n\\nthumbPrior to the 20th century, most huqin instruments were used primarily to accompany various forms of Chinese opera and narrative. The use of the erhu as a solo instrument began in the early 20th century along with the development of guoyue (literally \"national music\"), a modernized form of Chinese traditional music written or adapted for the professional concert stage. Active in the early 20th century were Zhou Shaomei (周少梅, 1885-1938) and Liu Tianhua (刘天华, 1895-1932). Liu laid the foundations of modern erhu playing with his ten unaccompanied solos and 47 studies composed in the 1920s and 1930s. Liu Beimao (刘北茂, 1903-1981) was born in Jiangyin, Jiangsu. His compositions include Xiao hua gu (1943) (Little flower drum). Jiang Fengzhi (蔣风之) (1908-1986) and Chen Zhenduo (陈振铎) were students of Liu Tianhua, the piece Hangong Qiuyue (Autumn Moon Han Palace) was adapted and arranged by Jiang. Hua Yanjun (A Bing) (华彥君-阿炳, c. 1893-1950) was a blind street musician. Shortly before his death in 1950, two Chinese musicologists recorded him playing a few erhu and pipa solo pieces, the best known being Erquan Yingyue.\\n\\nWith the founding of the PRC and the expansion of the conservatory system, the solo erhu tradition continued to develop. Important performers during this time include Lu Xiutang (陆修堂, 1911-1966), Zhang Rui (张锐, 1920- ) Sun Wenming (孙文明, 1928-1962), Huang Haihuai (黄海怀), Liu Mingyuan (刘明源, 1931-1996), Tang Liangde (汤良德, 1938-2010), Zhang Shao (张韶), and Song Guosheng(宋国生).\\n\\nLiu Mingyuan (刘明源) (1931-1996) was born in Tianjin. He was known for his virtuosity on many instruments of the huqin family, in particular the banhu. His compositions and arrangements include Henan Xiaoqu (Henan folk tune), and Cao Yuan Shang (On Grassland) for zhonghu. For many years he taught at the China Conservatory of Music in Beijing.\\n\\nTang Liangde (Tong Leung Tak, 汤良德, 1938-2010) was born in Shanghai into a famous Shanghainese musical family. He won the \"Shanghai's Spring\" erhu competition and continued to be the soloist for the Chinese Film Orchestra in Beijing, his composition and solos can be heard throughout the Nixon to China documentary movie. Tang was the soloist and performed at the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra, then went onto music broadcasting and education for the Hong Kong Government's Music Office making worldwide tours, and was named Art Educator of the Year in 1991 by the Hong Kong Artist Guild.\\n\\nWang Guotong (王国潼, b. 1939) was born in Dalian, Liaoning. He studied with Jiang Fengzhi, Lan Yusong and Chen Zhenduo, and in 1960 graduated from the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. He performed the premiere of Sanmenxia Changxiangqu (Sanmen Gorge Rhapsody) composed by Liu Wenjin. In 1972 Wang became the erhu soloist, and later art director, with the China Broadcasting Traditional Orchestra. He returned to the Central Conservatory of Music in 1983 as head of the Chinese music department. He has written many books and articles on erhu playing and has performed in many countries. Wang also worked with the Beijing National Instruments Factory to further develop erhu design.\\n\\nMin Huifen (閔惠芬, 1945- ) was born in Yixing, Jiangsu. Min first became known as the winner of the 1964 fourth Shanghai Spring national erhu competition. She studied with Lu Xiutang and Wang Yi, and graduated from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in 1968, and became the erhu soloist with the Shanghai minzu yuetuan (Shanghai Folk Orchestra).\\n\\nYang Ying (杨英, b. 1959) was the featured soloist for the Chinese National Song and Dance Ensemble (中央歌舞团) of Beijing from 1978-1996. She was a national erhu champion, frequently recorded for the Chinese film and record industry, and is listed in famous persons of China. \\n\\nThe erhu is featured along with other traditional Chinese instruments such as the pipa in the contemporary Chinese instrumental music group, Twelve Girls Band. They perform traditional Chinese music as well as Western classical and popular music.\\n\\nA few groups have utilized the erhu in a rock context. The Taiwanese black metal band Chthonic uses the erhu; they are the only black metal band to do so. The New Jersey-based progressive rock band The Hsu-nami plays a variety of rock sub-styles including metal, psychedelic, prog rock, and funk. An amplified erhu takes the place of lead vocals. Chie Mukai of the Japanese improv unit Ché-SHIZU also plays the erhu.\\n\\nAnother group which falls more under Electronica/Drum & Bass is a musical duo from Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The group, known as USS or Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker, uses an erhu in a different context. The USS sound is a mixture of drum and bass beats, grunge-like guitar riffs and 2-step rhythms. The erhu is one of their notable instruments they use in the course of their two released CDs, \"Wielding the C:/\" and \"Questamation\".\\n\\n"}

Because of a foot surgery, Decker sat out the Broncos Rookie Mini Camp and OTA's. Broncos Head Coach Josh McDaniels said he hopes he'll be ready for the season opener, “At this point we’re going to err on the side of being real careful and not put them in a situation where (it’s) the last day of minicamp on June 13th and all of a sudden we have a foot injury,\" said McDaniels.\"hopefully everybody will be ready by August.” On July 27, 2010, the Denver Broncos signed Decker to a 4 year contract.  In preseason, Decker led all NFL rookies in receptions, but due to the Broncos depth at receiver, Decker didn't see much action in the offense until late in the regular season. He did contribute on special teams however, recording seven special teams tackles while returning 17 kickoffs for 429 yards giving him a 25.2 yards per return average. That average would have been even higher had the refs not called back his 98-yard opening kickoff return against the Cardinals in week 13 with a holding penalty. Toward the end of the 2010 season the Broncos did start to mix Decker into the offense more, after fellow rookie Demaryius Thomas--a first round draft pick--went down with an ankle injury.

He is affectionately referred to as \"Admiral Aybar\" by Angels fans, named after the beloved Star Wars character Admiral Ackbar.\\n\\nAybar hit his first career major league home run on September 25, 2007, in a game against the Texas Rangers.\\n\\nOn September 5, 2009, Aybar tied a franchise record for most triples in a game, 2, against the Kansas City Royals.\\n\\nSeptember 8, 2009, Aybar had his first career walk-off hit, against the Seattle Mariners.\\n\\nIn game 4 of the 2009 ALCS, Aybar made a single non-glove hand catch to get a double play.\\n\\nHe used to have long dreads, but before Game 6 of the 2009 ALCS he shaved his head.\\n\\nIn game 3 of the 2009 ALDS against the Boston Red Sox, his hit against Jonathan Papelbon in the 9th inning with 2 outs and 2 strikes kept the Angels alive in Game \\n\\nOn September 30, 2010, Aybar swung and missed on a pitch from Texas Rangers pitcher Darren O'Day. The pitch struck him in his testicles and he became an overnight sensation on Youtube\\n\\nIn 2009, Aybar hit .312 (eight in the AL) and posted the fourth-best OPS (.776) of all AL shortstops.\\n\\nIn 2009, Aybar was included in a rumored list of players that the Blue Jays' would accept in a deal for ace Roy Halladay, but broke down when the Angels refused to send Aybar to Toronto as part of the deal. Some speculation had it that Aybar was Angels' owner Arte Moreno's favorite player. His name was raised again as a potential trade piece in a move for Halladay during the 2009 Winter Meetings. General Manager Tony Reagins commented that, \"It would take a significant package to move some players. Erick is very talented. We haven't seen the best of him yet. He's still improving, and there's a real good chance we'll see that in an Angels uniform.\" Scioscia confirmed that much of the discussions turned on Aybar, saying, \"It just didn't turn out to be a match. But I do know Toronto was asking for our shortstop.\"\\n\\nDuring the MLB offseason, Aybar plays in the Caribbean Series alongside many other fellow MLB players from the countries involved. It is a way for them to prepare for the upcoming MLB season by playing in live games and it is a way for them to represent their country. The most talked about series was probably in 2006 when Venezuela and the Dominican Republic squared off. Both of these countries are no strangers to each other and have developed a very heated rivalry over the years. \\n\\nDown, 4-3, in the ninth, Baltimore catcher Ramon Hernandez, named the Caribbean Series MVP, led off the bottom of the frame with a single and was immediately replaced by pinch runner William Bergolla. The moved proved to be a wise one because Bergolla advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt and tied the game at 4 when he rambled home on Gonzalez's single to right field. He would not stay at first long.\\n\\nCubs catcher Henry Blanco followed with a high popup to shallow left field between Dominican shortstop Erick Aybar and left fielder Napoleón Calzado. Backpedaling and seemingly confused, the ball hit Aybar's head and rolled away. Gonzalez sped around the bases to send Venezuela's Caracas Baseball Club into the record books with a 5-4 victory to secure the title.\\n\\nAybar is the youngest brother (by 10 months) of Tampa Bay Rays infielder Willy Aybar. He is also the cousin of Wil Aybar, who coaches Central Mass Diving and the diving team at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ericofon", "body": "thumbthumb\\n\\nThe Ericofon, or Cobra Phone is a plastic one-piece telephone created by the Ericsson Company and marketed throughout the second half of the 20th century. It was the first commercially marketed telephone design to incorporate the dial and headset into a single unit. Because of its styling, and influence on future telephone design, the Ericofon is considered one of the most significant industrial designs of the 20th century and is in the collection of Museum of Modern Art.\\n\\nThe Ericofon is a Swedish telephone handset created by Ericsson. It was designed in the late 1940s by a design team including Gösta Thames, Ralph Lysell and Hugo Blomberg. A specific feature of the telephone is that the two major components—the handset and the dial—are combined in a single unit. This one-piece design anticipated the evolution of the typical cordless phone and cell phone by several decades. The Ericofon is considered a landmark in plastic industrial design, and is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Serial production began in 1954. The earlier models were only sold to institutions, but in 1956 production for the open market begun in Europe and Australia. In Sweden it is known as the cobra telephone, due to its similarity with the serpent.\\n\\nBell Telephone Laboratories would initially not allow the introduction of the Ericofon to USA, but it soon became a best selling model.\\n\\nProduction of the Ericofon in the USA took place at North Electric's facility in Ohio.\\n\\nThe original phone was produced in two slightly different designs. The earliest version is slightly taller, with the earpiece at nearly a 90 degree angle to the base. A later version has a shorter handle, with the earpiece angled slightly downward. Both versions were produced in all 18 colors. Ericofons were produced using the three-prong plug standard in the USA at the time.\\n\\nA third version, the Model 700, was produced beginning in 1976 and is easily distinguished from earlier Ericofons by its squarish design, as well as changes to the handle and plug.\\n\\nWhen it was introduced on the USA market, it was available in 18 different colors, but after subsequent transfer of the production to North Electric the number of colors was reduced to eight. A small number of clear and metallic finish phones were also produced for special promotions. The most popular and most produced colors were bright red and bright white. Other colors were various pastel shades of blue, green, and pink. The phone was never produced in black.\\n\\nMost of the Ericofons made had mechanical rotary dial, typical of all phones made in that era. While Ericofons produced by Ericsson used miniature buzzers as their ringers, North Electric introduced the electronic \"Ericotone\" ringer in its Ericofons. The Ericotone ringer used a simple, 1-transistor oscillator circuit to produce a distinctive \"chirping\" sound to serve as the phone's ringer. This was one of the earliest applications of a transistor in a telephone, as telephones with mechanical bell ringers and rotary dial did not need transistors.\\n\\nNorth Electric also introduced a touch-tone version of the Ericofon in the United States in 1967, but this variant was not produced in the numbers that the rotary dial version was. The touch-tone version has also become rarer over time as a design flaw in the hookswitch mechanism can cause the phone to become unusable if it is set down too forcibly. North Electric ceased production of the Ericofon for North America in 1972.\\n\\nEricsson also introduced a push-button version of the Ericofon, the model 700, for the company's 100th anniversary in 1976. The model 700 had a squarer design but it was not touch-tone. Instead, its electronics transmitted electrical pulses as its buttons were pressed, mimicking the pulses produced by a rotary dial. Ericsson also continued to produce rotary-dial Ericofons until about 1980.\\n\\nThe design is produced today by Wild and Wolf. It is produced in red and metallic silver touch-tone versions and can be bought from internet stores. This version has touch tone buttons and plugs into a normal land line socket with a cord.\\n\\nAn electrical engineer and designer \"sqnewton\" (link below) commercializes original Ericofons that connect via Bluetooth to any cellular phone. The designer created a tiny, microcontroller based board that resides inside the Ericofon and enables special features, such as providing dial tone, dialing numbers using its rotary dial, providing busy tone when the current call drops, receiving calls, mimicking the original Ericotone ringer, redial, speed dial, voice recognition dial, direct inward dialing using dtmf tones to reach and select phone menus, text message notifications and other features, making this type of phone unique. Most of these features are part of the cell phone, so not all of them may work on all cell phones.\\n\\nThe Ericofon has been featured in several feature films and TV shows, mostly from the 1960s.\\n\\n"}

His father was a sea-captain in the merchant navy, and his mother a graduate of the Royal College of Music. In his youth, Enby studied the Classics, natural-science subjects and music. In 1962, he began to study medicine in Heidelberg. In 1967, Enby returned to Sweden and continued his medical education. In 1973 he was authorized as a licensed physician by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, but his license was revoked in 2007.\\n\\nFrom 1973 to 1974 Enby worked at a dermatology clinic in Gothenburg. In 1974 he began clinical studies, and he then became interested in alternative medicine. He gathered more knowledge and information in this field through specialist literature and on study tours in the United States and Germany.\\n\\nIn 1977 Enby opened a private medical practice to explore new forms of therapy. As it turned out, there were many opportunities to help patients who could not find a remedy for their illnesses in the established medical care, and his grew. In addition, he had his work at the University Clinic for Geriatrics at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, where he was in charge of a ward with various policlinical duties. In 1980 he became a specialist in the field of geriatrics including internal medicine. Eventually, he also became a general practitioner. He retired from 27536.aspx Sahlgrenska University Hospital in 2004.\\n\\nIn 1979-1980 Enby became interested in the definitions of “health”, “illness” and “death”. His idea is that an illness must be a special condition arising in the tissues. These ideas made it impossible for him to participate whole-heartedly in the research work at the clinic where he was employed, because he found that the research he was interested in lay in a different direction. After a while he developed his method of research, and for decades spent all his leisure time working on his theory. He explains what he means by \"health\", \"illness\" and \"death\" with the aid of microbe-like formations he has found in patients' blood. His analyses are based on blood microscopy work carried out by the professor in zoology, Günther Enderlein, towards the end of his life. In addition to his own research, Enby managed to continue his work at the hospital.\\n\\nIn 2007 Enby's medical license was revoked because of his pseudoscientificic methods of treating cancer patients, as it is illegal in Sweden to treat certain serious illnesses using methods that have no scientific basis.\\n\\nEnby is primarily known for his work with blood and his theories about the origins of diseases.Since the late 1970s, Enby has carried out independent research on the nature of illness and the phenomenon of chronic illness. His research is based on the idea that illness is caused by pleomorphic microbiological growth. Could the symptom picture of different illnesses be traced back to a common denominator? He claims that his work confirms that most of the chronically ill have growing structures in blood and solid tissues, not described earlier in modern medical research. The medical community has not accepted his results since he has not been able to provide evidence for his case.\\n\\nThe Ethical Committee of the University of Gothenburg approved Enby's research in 1983, and he is officially allowed to take blood tests to go ahead with his research.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ernst Rexer", "body": "Ernst Rexer (2 April 1902 in Stuttgart – 14 May 1983 in Dresden) was a German nuclear physicist. He worked on the German nuclear energy program during World War II. After the war, he was sent to Laboratory V, in Obninsk, to work on the Soviet atomic bomb project. In 1956, he was sent to East Germany, where he was a professor and director of the Institute for the Application of Radioactive Isotopes at the Technische Hochschule Dresden.\\n\\nIn 1923, Rexer began studies in chemistry and physics at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg. In 1926 he completed the Chemikerverbandsexamen (Chemist Federation exam). From 1926 to 1929, he worked in the Osram Werke (Osram Works), in Weisswasser and Berlin. In 1929, he received his doctorate from the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität (today, the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin).\\n\\nAfter receipt of his doctorate in 1929, Rexer became an associate assistant (außerplanmäßiger Assistant) at the Institut für Theoretische Physik (Institute for Theoretical Physics) at the Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg. In 1936, he completed his Habilitation there, with an Habilitationsschrift on the physics of crystals. In 1937, he joined the faculty at Halle as a Dozent (lecturer).\\n\\nIn 1938, Rexer took a position in the armaments industry where he investigated plastics.\\n\\nThe German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club), was initiated in 1939, shortly after the discovery of nuclear fission. By September, the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) squeezed out the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) of the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Ministry of Education) and began its control over the project, under the direction of Kurt Diebner. Rexer was brought into the project. By 1942 it was apparent that the nuclear energy project would not make a decisive contribution to ending the war effort in the near term and HWA control of the project was transferred to the RFR. At that time, Rexer and his colleagues, including Heinz Pose, were transferred to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR). Abraham Esau was President of the PTR, and he took control of the Uranverein in December, when he was appointed Plenipotentiary (Bevollmächtiger) for Nuclear Physics.\\n\\nWhile Rexer was at the PTR, some of the research was carried out at the Versuchsstelle (testing station) of the HWA in Gottow; Kurt Diebner, was director of the facility. The testing station is where Rexer, F. Berkei, W. Borrmann, W. Czulius, Kurt Diebner, Georg Hartwig, Karl-Heinz Höcker, Walter Herrmann, and Heinz Pose, compared the effectiveness of neutron production in a paraffin-moderated reactor using uranium plates, rods, and cubes. Internal reports (See section below: Internal Reports.) on their activities were classified Top Secret and had limited distribution. The G-1 experiment performed at the HWA testing station had lattices of 6,800 uranium oxide cubes (about 25 tons) in the neutron moderator paraffin. Their work verified Höcker’s calculations that cubes were better than rods, and rods were better than plates.\\n\\nIn 1944, Rexer was appointed professor at the Physikalischen Institut (Physics Institute) at the Universität Leipzig.\\n\\nNear the close of World War II, the Soviet Union sent special search teams into Germany to locate and deport German nuclear scientists or any others who could be of use to the Soviet atomic bomb project. The Russian Alsos teams were headed by NKVD Colonel General A. P. Zavenyagin and staffed with numerous scientists, from their only nuclear laboratory, attired in NKVD officer’s uniforms. In the autumn of 1945, Pose was offered the opportunity to work in the Soviet Union, which he accepted. He arrived in the Soviet Union, with his family, in February 1946. He was to establish and head Laboratory V (also known by the code name Malojaroslavets-10, after the nearby town by the same name) in Obninsk. The scientific staff at Laboratory V was to be both Russian and German, the former being mostly political prisoners from the Gulag or exiles; this type of facility is known as a Sharashka. (Laboratory B in Sungul’ was also a sharashka and its personnel worked on the Soviet atomic bomb project. Notable Germans at Laboratory B were Hans-Joachim Born, Alexander Catsch, Nikolaus Riehl, and Karl Zimmer. Notable Russians from the Gulag were N. V. Timofeev-Resovskij and S. A. Voznesenskij.) \\n\\nOn 5 March 1946, in order to staff his laboratory, Pose and NKVD General Kravchenko, along with two other officers, went to Germany for six months to hire scientists. Additionally, Pose procured equipment from the companies AEG, Zeiss, Schott Jena, and Mansfeld, which were in the Russian occupation zone.\\n\\nPose planned 16 laboratories for his institute, which was to include a chemistry laboratory and eight laboratories. Three heads of laboratories, Czulius, Herrmann, and Rexer, were Pose’s colleagues who worked with him at the German Army’s testing station in Gottow, under the Uranverein project. (See below: Internal Reports.) Eight laboratories in the institute were: \\n\\nIn preparation for release from the Soviet Union, it was standard practice to put personnel into quarantine for a few years if they worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project, which Rexer did. After quarantine, he was sent to the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, German Democratic Republic) in 1956. He was appointed extraordinarius professor and Director of the Institutes für die Anwendung radioaktiver Isotope (Institute for the Application of Radioactive Isotopes) at the Technische Hochschule Dresden (today, Technische Universität Dresden). Other notable German scientists, who worked on the Soviet atomic bomb project and joined Rexer at the Technische Hochschule Dresden were Heinz Pose and two other physicists, Werner Hartmann and Heinz Barwich, who had been at Gustav Hertz’s Institute G, in Agudseri (Agudzery).\\n\\nThe following reports were published in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics), an internal publication of the German Uranverein. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Erosion prediction", "body": "There are dozens of erosion prediction models. Most have been developed for agricultural areas and are design to compare predicted annual rates of soil loss from broad areas under various cropland and rangeland management techniques. Some are purely statistical models, others mechanistic. Two of the more widely used methods in North America are the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Water Erosion Prediction Project erosion model (WEPP). Much of the research on erosion rates is directed towards supporting or fitting these competing models. In particular much of the mineland erosion literature is solely focused on fitting or improving RUSLE parameters. Aside from a few new deterministic gully erosion models, these models do not consider gully erosion – mostly due to difficulties in modelling, and partly because gullies are often repaired in agricultural, forestry, or mining environments.\\n\\nBecause there is a wide discrepancy between predicted and observed erosion rates, models are better as research tools than as public policy and regulatory instruments or for prescriptive design measures for constructed landforms. But some models may provide useful guidance for the design engineer if adequately calibrated and verified for local conditions and if the design accounts for the uncertainty. \\n\\nMost erosion modelling is applied to existing sites of known topography and material properties to guide land management activities. Designers of constructed landforms, however, have considerable control over the topography, cover soil placement, initial revegetation, and to a lesser extent the substrate properties – flexibility that is generally uneconomical for farmers and ranchers and most users of erosion models. On the other hand, miners have little input into post-closure land use practices and management. \\n\\nMethods to estimate erosion rates include:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Erotic hypnosis", "body": "Erotic hypnosis is the sexual interest in hypnosis and similar forms of mental persuasion or mind control. Reducing inhibitions and increasing arousal are the most common goals of erotic hypnosis.\\n\\nErotic hypnosis may be used within a Dominance and submission (or D/s) relationship as a form of erotic power exchange, with the submissive person willingly surrendering his or her will to the dominant in exchange for sexual pleasure and/or an emotional bond. Hypnosis enhances the feelings of submission to the point where a submissive can actually feel a dominant's control moving their body or influencing their thoughts. This creates an intense feeling of belonging and intimacy.\\n\\nPersonality transformation is another common fantasy. People who identify with the submissive side of erotic hypnosis often fantasize about being freed from responsibilities or inhibitions and transformed into someone who can freely enjoy the sexual pleasures they imagine or read about. Such sexually submissive personae include the slave, female stereotypes like the \"bimbo,\" \"slut,\" and stripper, and fictional characters from popular media.\\n\\nErotic hypnosis has a long history, stretching as far back as the ancient world. Western culture (along with many others around the globe) is filled with early myths of seduction by some form of mind control. The Sirens of Greek mythology are famously depicted in Homer's ''Odyssey'' as having a \"bewitching\" song that lures sailors to their deaths. The witches of the Middle Ages also had a hypnotic aspect in their sexuality.\\n\\nIn medieval legend, an incubus (plural incubi; from Latin incubare, \"to lie upon\") was a demon in male form supposed to lie upon sleepers, especially women, in order to have sexual intercourse with them. A succubus (plural succubi; from Latin succubare, \"to lie under\"), on the other hand, was a female demon who came to men, especially monks, in their dreams to seduce them, drawing energy from the men to sustain themselves, often until the point of the victim's exhaustion or death. The succubus legend was an explanation for the phenomena of wet dreams and sleep paralysis. Examples of succubi are found in various mythologies and fantasies, such as Lilith and the Lilin (Jewish), Lilitu (Sumerian) and Rusalka (Slavic).\\n\\nThe Erotic Nature of Hypnosis\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eruera Tirikatene", "body": "Sir Eruera Tihema Te Aika Tirikatene, KCMG (5 January 1895 – 11 January 1967) was a New Zealand Māori politician of the Ngai Tahu tribe. Known in early life as Edward James Te Aika Tregerthen, he was the first Ratana Member of Parliament and was elected in a by-election for Southern Maori in June 1932 after the death of Tuiti Makitanara.\\n\\nHe remained the MP until his death in 1967, when his daughter Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan succeeded to the seat, also in a by-election.\\n\\nthumbAfter education at St Stephen's Anglican Church, Tirikatene worked on farms before enlisting in 1914 for the First World War. He served three years with the New Zealand Māori (Pioneer) Battalion, reaching the rank of sergeant and commended for carrying a wounded soldier while under fire.\\n\\nIn 1919, he was married to Ruti Matekino Solomon and the couple went on to have twelve children. In the same year, he settled on a small farm near Kaiapoi, where he also set up a dairy farm, a saw mill, a fishing fleet and a ferry service.\\n\\nBy 1921 he visited Ratana pā, and T. W. Ratana, the spiritual leader or Te Mangai of Ratana predicted an important role for him. Te Mangai persuaded him to stay, and with his practical skills, served the movement by taking charge of harvesting of the Ratana lands.\\n\\nAs the Ratana movement developed into a political movement, Eruera Tirikatene became a leader in the internal political council and stood for parliament in the 1928 and 1931 elections, being defeated narrowly in both. In 1928 he and most of his extended family spent the election at Ratana Pa helping with the wheat harvest. At this time there were few provisions for absentee voting, and unable to even vote for himself, Tirikatene lost the election by one vote.\\n\\nIn June 1932, the sitting MP for Southern Maori, Tuiti Makitanara died suddenly and Eruera won the by-election to become the first Ratana MP. Tirikatene contained to represent his electorate until his death in January 1967.\\n\\nFrom his maiden speech, Tirikatene made recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi one of his major aims, presenting a petition with over 30,000 signatures. The petition from the Ratana morehu was held over for thirteen years before being virtually ignored, but Tirikatane continued to raise the Treaty issue in debates.\\n\\nDuring the depression of that time, Māori were expected to subsist from their land, and were not given equal access to unemployment payments and relief work. Proving entitlement to the old age pension was also more difficult for Māori, as Māori did not have to register births until 1919. Tirikatene spoke out against this discrimination in social welfare which caused poverty to Māori and the removal of this inequality by the Labour Government strengthened the Labour and Ratana bond.\\n\\nFollowing the Ratana-Labour alliance, Tirikatene became the First President of the Labour Party Māori Advisory Council, a committee to set Māori policy for the party. During the Second World War, Tirikatene set up and led the Māori War Effort Organisation. The experience of Māori running their own affairs led him to introduce the Māori Social and Economic Advancement Act of 1945, but it did not give the independence for iwi he had hoped for.\\n\\nBetween 1946 and 1949, Tirikatene was involved in land claim settlements for Waikato—Maniapoto and Taranaki. He persuaded the Ngai Tahu to accept the Ngaitahu Claim Settlement Act of 1944 and became president of the Ngaitahu Trust Board.\\n\\nAfter a period in opposition, he was appointed Minister of Forests, and Minister in charge of Printing and Stationery. Tirikatene was expecting Māori Affairs, which was taken by Prime Minister Walter Nash. The two often clashed, with Tirikatene wanting greater autonomy for Māori. One achievement of this period was the official recognition of Waitangi Day through the Waitangi Day Act 1960, commemorating the signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.\\n\\nTirikatene continued committee work while in opposition after 1960, and remained an MP until his death. He was succeeded in the seat by his daughter, Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan.\\n\\nSir Eruera Tihemia Tirikatene was knighted in June 1960 as a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.

{"title": "Erythrosuchus", "body": "Erythrosuchus (red crocodile) is an extinct genus of archosauriform reptile from the Triassic of South Africa and Namibia. Remains have been found from the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group in the Karoo of South Africa as well as the Omingonde Formation in Namibia.\\n\\nErythrosuchus was the largest predator of its time, at around  long, and  tall. It walked on all fours and had limbs which were positioned semi-vertically under its body, unlike the more sprawling gait of most earlier reptiles. Its head was huge and dinosaur-like, reaching a length of , and had sharp, conical teeth.\\n\\nIn the Late Triassic, the ecological niche left by Erythrosuchus was filled by creatures like Saurosuchus and Postosuchus.\\n\\nErythrosuchus was the largest erythrosuchid, but apart from its size, it was similar in appearance to other related genera. It had a large head and comparatively short neck. One of the only distinguishing features of Erythrosuchus other than its size is the smoothness of the margin of the squamosal, a bone at the rear of the skull. In other erythrosuchids, the margin of this bone projects backward from the skull, giving it a hook-like appearance. In Erythrosuchus, the margin is convex and lacks a hook.\\n\\nthumb Erythrosuchus is known from many specimens, most of which are fragmentary. The holotype, described by Robert Broom in 1905 and known as SAM 905, is poorly preserved. Only small pieces of the limbs, pectoral and pelvic girdle, skull, and a few vertebrae present in this specimen. A thorough description of the genus was given by German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene in 1911. The fossil material that served as the basis for the description is now housed in the Natural History Museum in London, England. Like the holotype, it is very fragmentary, and some specimens may even belong to the same individual as SAM 905. One specimen, known as BMNH R 3592, is relatively more complete, with much of the postcranial skeleton intact. \\n\\nEarly restorations of the skull of Erythrosuchus depicted it as being tall, similar in appearance to Tyrannosaurus. However, a complete skull that was later described in 1963 revealed that the true shape was less tall than previously thought. This skull, known as BPI 5207 and currently part of the collection of the Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research in South Africa, has a somewhat pointed snout. Earlier restorations may have shown a deeper snout because it was not known at the time how the bones of the skull articulated with one another.\\n\\nThe braincase has also been studied, and possesses features that are shared with other early archosauriforms. Many of these characteristics are considered plesiomorphic, or ancestral, in archosaur. While Erythrosuchus is not considered an archosaur, it is thought to be closely related to the last common ancestor of all archosaurs.\\n\\nThe hypothetical last common ancestor of archosaurs is thought to have shared many features with Erythrosuchus, many of which are found in the braincase. For example, the inner part of the otic capsule (the skeletal structure surrounding the inner ear) is not entirely ossified, or completely formed of bone. Neither is the channel for the perilymphatic duct, which is a tube that leaves the lagena. The lagena is the portion of the inner ear responsible for hearing, and is known as the cochlea in mammals (although in mammals it is coiled rather than straight). Erythrosuchus has a short lagena, which is also expected in the last common ancestor of all archosaurs.\\n\\nSome features of the ankle of Erythrosuchus suggest that it was beginning to adapt toward digitigrady, or walking on toes rather than having the entire foot placed on the ground. The ankle is similar to that of Euparkeria; the ankles of both of these animals are more advanced than those of other archosauriformes.\\n\\n"}

The second single \"Viento Loco\" would have the same name as the band formed by Esmi, Ray, Ramona, Maria, and Adam. Esmi's debut album caused a chain reaction of events such as a nomination for Rising Female Star, Most Promising Band, by the Tejano music industry, and was also invited by the Tejano Music Awards to present Male Vocalist Award for 1996. Moreover, Esmi was recognized as 1996 Best New Artist at the Hispanic Music Awards held in El Paso, Texas and also became spokesperson for Toys for Tots in that region.\\n\\nHer second album Si Supieras, released in 1996, is a compilation of songs inspired by the love that she shared with Adam Vargas, with songs such as \"Todo Mi Amor\" which samples Led Zeppelin's \"All of my Love.\" Later that year, Esmi was invited by the American GI Forum to perform in the Cinco de Mayo Festival in San Diego, California.

{"title": "Esther Cailingold", "body": "Esther Cailingold (1925–1948) was a British-born schoolteacher of Polish extraction, who fought with the Jewish forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and died of wounds received in the battle for the Old City of Jerusalem. She is commemorated, in Israel, by the Esther Cailingold memorial forest at Kibbutz Lavi in the Lower Galilee, by a scholarship fund at Yeshivat HaKotel in Jerusalem, and on various war memorials including that of the Israeli Armored Corps at Latrun. Several libraries and other rooms in children's homes in Israel are named after her. In England she is remembered through the Esther Cailingold society in North London, part of Emunah UK\\n\\nEsther Cailingold was born in Whitechapel, London, on 28 June 1925, eldest child of Moshe Cailingold and Anne, née Fenechel. Moshe had immigrated from Warsaw in 1920, and had opened up a London branch of his family's bookselling and publishing business. After the family moved to Stamford Hill, North London, in 1936, Esther attended the North London Collegiate School for girls, eventually winning a scholarship to Goldsmiths College, University of London (temporarily based in Nottingham), to study English. She graduated with first-class honours in 1946.\\n\\nEsther's Zionism derived principally from her strict Orthodox Jewish background. Her father, one of the founders of Poland's Young Mizrachi movement, maintained a fervent Zionism in the family home, such that \"Esther was a Zionist...before she knew of any formal movement or heard her first Zionist speech\". Her youthful convictions were strengthened by awareness of international events such as the rise of Hitler, the growth of European (and British) anti-semitism and later, during and immediately after the war, the emerging details of the Holocaust. Until then her Zionism had expressed itself mainly in religious and youth-related activities, such as her involvement with Bachad, which ran training farms in Britain and Europe to prepare young people for future life on a kibbutz. Thereafter her belief strengthened that her future lay with the Jewish community in Palestine, and in the autumn of 1946 she successfully applied for a post as an English teacher at the Evelina de Rothschild school in Jerusalem.\\n\\nEsther arrived in Jerusalem on 1 December 1946 to take up her teaching post. In the ensuing months, whilst immersing herself in the local culture, she witnessed the growing street violence, the imposition of curfews and other restrictions on movement, attacks on Jewish property and personnel, and specific events such as the trial, conviction and execution of Irgun activist Dov Gruner, and the drawn out saga of the refugee ships such as the ''Exodus''. As a result, her perspective changed; her letters home reflect a harder attitude and an increasingly sharp anti-British sentiment. By October 1947 she had joined Haganah, and while continuing with her teaching job for the time being, she began attending training camps to prepare for possible combat duty. In January 1948 she left Evelina de Rothschild and became a full-time Haganah soldier. In addition to military duties and continuing training she acted as a continuity announcer for Haganah's English-language broadcasting service, whilst seeking a posting to the garrison defending the Jewish Quarter in the Old City, the most vulnerable of all the Jewish sectors within Jerusalem.\\n\\nThere are two distinct narratives relating to the 1948 battle for the Jewish Quarter. The Arab narrative tells of a well-planned and executed military victory against a fanatical and determined foe. The Jewish narrative recounts a struggle against hopeless odds by a tiny force that by its bravery and determination held out for two weeks before being overwhelmed. There is truth in each version.\\n\\nIn 1948 the Jewish Quarter covered a smaller area than it had once and does now. It then housed around 1700 civilians, mainly women, children and elderly, and was defended by a small garrison of mixed Haganah, Irgun and Lehi troops under a Haganah commander. The Quarter was entirely cut off from the rest of Jewish Jerusalem, surrounded by hostile Arab districts and effectively indefensible in the face of attack. It had no strategic military value but was of great symbolic importance. However, its garrison was severely undermanned and undersupplied, dependent for food and other necessities on a weekly convoy escorted by British troops, through which arms and additional combat troops had to be smuggled.\\n\\nEsther entered the Old City, ostensibly as a teacher, in the last of such convoys, on 7 May 1948 and reported to the Haganah commander. Her assigned task was a mobile role - supplying the needs (arms, ammunition, food, drink, etc.) of the various outposts throughout the quarter. When she arrived, a tenuous truce was operating and things were relatively quiet, but a full-scale onslaught on the Quarter was anticipated, after the anticipated British troops withdrawal on 14 May. This duly occurred. Sections of the civilian population wanted to negotiate a cease fire. They had to be forcibly restrained. On 16 May, during the first sustained attack on the Quarter, Esther was wounded, though not disabled - she quickly returned to her duties after a field-dressing, often using the exposed rooftops as her means of access between posts.On 19 May a small Palmach unit broke through the Zion Gate and reached the beleaguered garrison. Esther was there to receive them and for a moment it seemed that fortunes might have turned, but the force swiftly withdrew. On that same day, King Abdullah's Arab Legion arrived at the Mount of Olives and began shelling the Jewish Quarter, which was contracting daily as Arab ground troops advanced. It became a house-to-house battle, and Esther's mobile role became impossible, so she joined one of the defending groups as a Sten gunner. On 26 May she was seriously injured when a building she had just entered exploded, shattering her spine. She was carried to the Quarter's hospital, but lack of supplies meant that little medical treatment was available. When the hospital came under shell-fire the next day Esther and the other wounded were moved to a safer area. Here, she remained conscious and able to talk, read her bible and say her prayers. Meanwhile, with the destruction of the Hurva synagogue, resistance in the Jewish Quarter effectively ended, with less than forty defenders still holding out. Surrender followed shortly afterwards.\\n\\nAfter the surrender on 28 May, Esther and the other wounded were moved once again, this time to the nearby Armenian School, just outside the Jewish Quarter. Early on the following morning Esther, after refusing a cigarette (it was Shabbat), fell into a coma and did not regain consciousness. She died some time around 5.00am on Saturday 29 May. Her last letter to her parents had been written six days earlier and handed to fellow-soldier Chaveh Leurer, who passed it to Harry Levin after the surrender. Levin in turn gave it to Moshe Cailingold when the latter came to Jerusalem in July.\\n\\nAfter the surrender of the Jewish Quarter garrison to the Arab Legion under Abdullah al Tel, the remaining buildings in the quarter were systematically destroyed, including 58 of the 59 Synagogues in the Old City. The quarter's Jewish residents were removed to Israeli lines, and lost all their property. The Arab victory in the Old City was one of their few successes in the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict, which they termed their al Nakba or \"catastrophe\". In the Six-Day War of June 1967 Jewish forces captured the entire Old City, and thereafter the Jewish Quarter was rebuilt.\\n\\nNone of the men or women who fought for the Jewish Quarter in 1948 received citations for bravery, although Moshe Roussak singled Esther out as deserving. Along with the 38 other Old City fighters who died, Esther was posthumously enlisted in the IDF Israeli Defence Forces and, after temporary burial in a west Jerusalem quarry, her body was re-interred in Mount Hertzl military cemetery in September 1950.\\n\\n"}

However, during the early years, Estudiantes had to use a red shirt with a white stripe in the chest, because league authorities decided the uniform was too similar to Alumni's.\\n\\nthumbEstudiantes's first pitch was located at the intersection of 19th and 53th streets in La Plata (now Plaza Islas Malvinas), with the first match being played on November 7, 1905, when Estudiantes faced Nacional Juniors from Buenos Aires. A year later, Estudiantes enrolled in the Argentine Amateur Association.\\n\\nThe stadium on 1st Avenue opened on 25 December 1907.\\n\\nBefore the advent of professionalism, Estudiantes won the 1913 league title .\\n\\nWhen professionalism was adopted in Argentine football in 1931, Estudiantes had a famous offensive lineup: Miguel Ángel Lauri, Alejandro Scopelli, Alberto Zozaya, Manuel Ferreira and Enrique Guaita, known as Los Profesores (\"The Professors\"), and still regarded as one of Argentina's all-time finest . Alberto Zozaya scored the first goal of professional football in Argentina and was the top goalscorer of the first professional tournament. Ferreira played for the national team in the 1928 Olympic Games and the 1930 World Cup; Guaita and Scopelli played for Italian national team that won the 1934 FIFA World Cup. Saúl Calandra, the Sbarra brothers (Raúl and Roberto) and Armando Nery were feared defensive players.\\n\\nIn 1937, a pioneering lighting system was installed in the stadium, allowing to play night games.\\n\\nThe 1950s saw the rise of goalkeeper Gabriel Ogando, and players such as Walter Garcerón, Alberto Bouché, Juan Eulogio Urriolabeitía, Ricardo Infante, Héctor Antonio, as well as the final seasons of striker Manuel Pelegrina, who remains Estudiantes' all-time top scorer with 221 goals. Following a confrontation with the Peronist government of Buenos Aires Province, the club's management was removed by authorities (allegedly for refusing to distribute copies of Eva Perón's book to club members) The government-appointed management disbanded the team: top scorers Infante and Pelegrina signed with Huracán. The decimated team was relegated in 1953, but after the return of Pelegrina (who tricked Huracán by becoming a free agent without the club's consent) , Estudiantes was promoted the following year. The club was allowed to govern itself soon thereafter.\\n\\nIn the 1960s, Miguel Ignomiriello coached the Estudiantes under-19 team known as La Tercera que Mata (\"The Killer Juveniles\"), which would evolve, with a few acquisitions, into the team coached by Osvaldo Zubeldía that won the 1967 ''Metropolitano'' championship. With this title, Estudiantes became the first club outside of the \"big five\" (Boca Juniors, River Plate, Racing Club, Independiente and San Lorenzo) to obtain a professional title. This opened the floodgates, and soon other \"small\" clubs would do likewise (Vélez Sársfield in 1968, Chacarita Juniors one year later, and soon other teams joined as well).thumbEstudiantes went on to win the Copa Libertadores three years in a row (1968, 1969 and 1970), and the 1968 Intercontinental Cup against Manchester United. The latter game is still remembered for the violent behaviour of Estudiantes' players. They lost the Intercontinental title against A.C. Milan (1969) and Feyenoord (1970). Estudiantes won the maiden edition of the Copa Interamericana in a three-legged final against the reigning CONCACAF title-holders, Mexican club Toluca (the games were played in 1969, but official references call it the 1968 edition).\\n\\nThe last part of the Zubeldía era was marred by the antics of some players. Following a violent Intercontinental match against Milan, the entire team was arrested on orders from Argentine President Juan Carlos Onganía. In an unprecedented step, goalkeeper Alberto Poletti was suspended for life (he was later pardoned) and did time in jail, together with teammates Ramón Aguirre Suárez and Raúl Madero. Because of these events, it became a cliché to refer to Zubeldía's football as el antifútbol (\"the anti-football\"), not only because of its physical violence, but also due to its frequent resort to timewasting tactics . The Times went so far as to call Estudiantes \"one of the most despicable teams ever to emerge from South America.\"\\n\\nZubeldía hired former referees to lecture the team on regulations, so that his players would be able to exploit every loophole in the book. Also, he incorporated tactics that were unheard of at the time, such as playbook drills for free-kicks and corner kicks, the offside trap, and double-marking opponents .\\n\\nThe Zubeldía team counted two physicians among its stars: Carlos Bilardo and Raúl Madero graduated from the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Medicine during their playing days. Juan Ramón Verón was a gifted player who could play left wing, but would also join the midfielders or attack from the right. He profited from the no-nonsense playing of Marcos Conigliaro, Juan Miguel Echecopar and Madero, and the tactical guidance provided by Bilardo. Right-back Eduardo Luján Manera was a very talented player, but suffered from repeated injuries and did not reach his full potential. Fullback Aguirre Suárez was noted for his often violent play, and so was Luis Medina.thumbAfter the 1970 season, Carlos Bilardo retired from play and got involved in his family's furniture business. As the team's fortunes were declining and relegation seemed a possibility, he was called by management in mid-1971 to coach the team. Under his guidance, Estudiantes lost the 1975 Nacional title in the last day of play and made it to the 1976 Copa Libertadores.\\n\\nIn the ensuing years, Bilardo alternated between coaching Estudiantes and Colombia teams. He was briefly the coach of the Colombian national team, but was called again by Estudiantes in 1982. Soon after, the team won the 1982 ''Metropolitano'' championship. Under his successor Eduardo Luján Manera, also a member of the Zubeldía's team, Estudiantes won the 1983 ''Nacional'' tournament as well. Both wins were at the expense of a star-studded Independiente.\\n\\nThose championship teams were anchored by a solid defense (Julián Camino on the right and Abel Ernesto Herrera on the left were also fearsome attackers, and José Luis Brown provided security as a sweeper), and also had three creative midfielders (José Daniel Ponce, Alejandro Sabella and Marcelo Trobbiani, with Miguel Ángel Russo to guard their backs) and two top-notch strikers (Hugo Gottardi and Guillermo Trama).\\n\\nBilardo went on to coach the Argentine national team, that won the 1986 FIFA World Cup. The captain of Estudiantes' 1982 champions, José Luis Brown, scored the opening goal in the final match against West Germany. Four years later, Bilardo's Argentina reached the final of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Madero was team physician for both events, and Ricardo Echevarría, also from Estudiantes, was fitness coach.\\n\\nEstudiantes was relegated for the second time after the 1993–94 season, and again returned to the first division the very next season, which was the breakout year for Juan Sebastián Verón (son of former player Juan Ramón). In the ensuing years, the club had irregular results, and became known mostly as the breeding ground for strikers such as Martín Palermo, Luciano Galletti, Bernardo Romeo, Ernesto Farías and Mariano Pavone, as well as other quality players such as José Ernesto Sosa and Pablo Piatti.\\n\\nBilardo returned as coach in 2003, with new management bent on rebuilding the club in his winning ways. Some young players were promoted, such as Marcos Angeleri and José Ernesto Sosa. When Bilardo departed, the team remained a contender under coaches Reinaldo Merlo and Jorge Burruchaga. The team made history when it came from behind (0–3 in midtime) to win 4–3 against Peru Sporting Cristal in a Libertadores match played on 21 February 2006.\\n\\nOn May 18, 2006, Burruchaga was replaced with another former Argentine international, Diego Simeone, who built the team around Juan Sebastián Verón, who returned to Estudiantes after 11 years. Simeone's team was eliminated by São Paulo in a penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals of the 2006 Copa Libertadores, but went on to an impressive campaign in the local league during the 2006 Apertura. It amassed ten straight wins (tying the club record), including an unprecedented 7–0 win against Gimnasia in the La Plata derby, played 15 October 2006. Estudiantes finished the regular season tied for first place with Boca Juniors (per Argentine league rules, goal difference is not used to define the champion). A winner-take-all final match was played on December 13, 2006. Estudiantes came from behind to defeat Boca Juniors 2–1, thus securing its first first division title in 23 years. During this campaign, Estudiantes defeated all the \"big five\", allowed the least goals, and three of their players (Pavone, Verón and Braña) were ranked as the league's top three by sports diary Olé.\\n\\nSimeone left the team after the 2007 Apertura, and was replaced by former S.S. Lazio teammate Roberto Sensini. After a weak finish in the 2008 Clausura, Sensini was replaced with Leonardo Astrada. Under his guidance, Estudiantes reached the final of the 2008 Copa Sudamericana, which it lost to Brazilian side SC Internacional. Shortly thereafter, a string of bad results caused Astrada's departure.\\n\\nOn March 2009, former player Alejandro Sabella became head coach, his first such engagement (his coaching experience was limited to being an assistant to Daniel Passarella). The team improved their standing in the local league and advanced to the final of the 2009 Copa Libertadores, winning 2–1 on aggregate over Cruzeiro after a goal-less draw in La Plata and an away win on 15 July 2009. Verón was chosen as the competition's most valuable player, and Mauro Boselli was its top goalscorer, with a decisive header in the final match. Thus, Estudiantes earned the right to play the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi.\\n\\nIn that event, Estudiantes won their semifinal match against Pohang Steelers 2–1, and lost the final against FC Barcelona 2–1 in extra time, after a 1-1 tie in regulation time.\\n\\nAfter the Club World Cup participation, Estudiantes finished second in the 2010 Clausura (with local favorite José Sosa playing on loan), and won the 2010 Apertura after a protracted battle against Vélez Sarsfield. The team was in transition following the departure of Sosa and the sales of Boselli, right back Marcos Angeleri, and other key players.\\n\\nthumbJorge Luis Hirschi Stadium is located on 1st Avenue, between 55th and 57th Streets, in La Plata. In its previous incarnation, it had room for 23,000. The wooden stands behind the goal-lines were standing-room only. The stands next to the avenue were sitting-room, and were separated from the avenue by a row of tile trees. The opposite side was roofed and had the best seating arrangements. The noisiest fans used to occupy the 55th Street popular, while visiting fans were often directed to the 57th St. popular, opposite a technical high school (whose inconvenient location was responsible for the relatively small size of the pitch, at 105 x 68 m).\\n\\nFor many international games in the Zubeldía era, Estudiantes played in Boca Juniors' La Bombonera, noted for its intimidating acoustics.\\n\\nWith the erection of Estadio Ciudad de La Plata in the 1990s, both Estudiantes and Gimnasia decided initially against relocating their home games. However, Estudiantes's field was closed down in September 2005 because of new safety regulations which forbid standing-only wooden stands. This began a sequence of political infighting between the club and City Hall.\\n\\nDuring the 2005 Apertura tournament, Estudiantes played its home games in the nearby Gimnasia stadium, and after that in Quilmes Atlético Club's Centenario field. There, Estudiantes made history with a come-from-behind 4-3 Libertadores win against Sporting Cristal.\\n\\nOn April 2006 a court decree allowed the re-opening of 1 y 57, but mayor Julio Alak intervened again to prevent this from happening. In August 2006, an agreement was reached  to build sitting room for 20,000 (later amended to 23,000) and using the city stadium for games exceeding that capacity. Renovation work on the stadium started in 2007, and has met with opposition from several groups, notably the \"Hoja de Tilo\" NGO, who claims that the works would damage the environmental balance of the park behind the stadium.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Estudiantes settled in the city stadium, where it earned five consecutive derby wins, and had a streak of 37 games undefeated in the local league (2007–2009). When roofing work began in August 2009 to install a new roof in the city stadium, Estudiantes moved once again to Quilmes. As the city stadium will host the 2011 Copa América, it is expected to reopen in time for the 2011 Clausura.\\n\\nEstudiantes' training grounds are located in the Country Club premises in City Bell, north of La Plata. Many facilities were paid for by Juan Sebastián Verón while he played in Europe. Verón was also instrumental in the negotiations over the stadium, meeting then president Néstor Kirchner to unlock the process that was being stalled by mayor Alak.\\n\\nWithin the La Plata area, Estudiantes was traditionally regarded as the club of the middle class, while rival side Gimnasia y Esgrima was identified with the working class. This characterization seems to be outdated. While the two clubs have roughly the same pull in and around La Plata, Estudiantes has more of a nation-wide following, especially after its international successes in the 1960s. There used to be much discussion about which club has the larger following, but Estudiantes seems to have pulled forward.\\n\\nFor several periods in the club's history, a cadre of fans from Buenos Aires (los porteños) were a powerful element within the base. A famous fan since the 1960s is Raúl Bernechea, known as el pelapapas (the \"potato peeler\") after his job as a kitchen hand, famous for lighting bonfires during games, juggling and performing other stunts .\\n\\nAuthor Ernesto Sabato is an Estudiantes sympathizer, and was honored with a ceremony where he was given a No. 10 jersey. Arturo Jauretche mentioned Estudiantes in one of his books .\\n\\nOther noted fans include tennis player Juan Mónaco, actor Jorge D'Elía, filmmaker and politician Fernando Solanas, and journalist Osvaldo Príncipi.\\n\\nIn the 1983 presidential election, Estudiantes fans were, together with their peers from Vélez Sársfield, the first to voice their support for eventual winner Raúl Alfonsín in his bid against the Peronistas. The friendship with Vélez supporters has since vanished, especially after an Estudiantes win denied Vélez the 2003 championship.\\n\\nEstudiantes is on friendly terms with several clubs from the South side of Greater Buenos Aires; especially Quilmes and Témperley. Platense, from the North side of Greater Buenos Aires, held a special place in the hearts of Estudiantes fans, as it cemented Gimnasia's relegation in 1979 (Platense currently plays in the lower divisions).\\n\\nEstudiantes is also friendly with the Uruguay fan base of Peñarol, once their classic Libertadores rivals.\\n\\nEstudiantes shares colors with Spanish side Athletic Bilbao, and during a period in the 1950s, both institutions shared a reputation for confronting the government (Bilbao as a Basque nationalist side against the Franco regime, and Estudiantes against Peronism). During these times, Bilbao donated a set of jerseys to Estudiantes. The relationship has been rekindled in the 2000s through Argentine expatriates and partisan blogs .\\n\\nThe nickname pincharratas (rat stabbers), often shortened to pinchas, comes from the nickname of Felipe Montedónica, who spent much time chasing after rats in the La Plata market in the 1910s and 1920s, and hence was known as \"el pincharratas\". Pictures exist of Montedónica with some of the players, where his nickname is mentioned . Traditionally, the nickname is also associated with the laboratory work done by the many Medicine students among the club's early members.\\n\\nThis nickname extends to the fans. It is common to hear fans say \"soy del pincha\" (\"I am pincha\").\\n\\nFans also call the team el león (the lion), el orgullo de la ciudad (the pride of the city), and los capos de La Plata (the bosses of La Plata).\\n\\nFor several years, many chants incorporated the word Tricampeón (three-time champion) because of the Libertadores three-peat. After the 2009 Libertadores final, some of the newer lyrics use the word Tetracampeón (four-time champion).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nsee also \\n\\n"}

In July 2007, Sporting de Braga announced a three-year sponsorship deal with French insurance company AXA, which included the change of the name by which the club refers to the stadium to Estádio AXA (AXA Stadium). However, the municipality, as landlord, clarified that the stadium had not been officially renamed as this was a deal involving its tenant only.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe stadium was carved from a quarry (Monte Castro) that overlooks the city of Braga. Stands run only along both sides of the pitch. Behind the goal at one end are the rock walls of the quarry and at the other is an open view over the city sprawling in the distance.

{"title": "Ethanol", "body": "Ethanol, also called ethyl alcohol, pure alcohol, grain alcohol, or drinking alcohol, is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid. It is a powerful psychoactive drug and one of the oldest recreational drugs. It is best known as the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages and thermometers. In common usage, it is often referred to simply as alcohol or spirits.\\n\\nEthanol is a straight-chain alcohol, and its molecular formula is CHOH. Its empirical formula is CHO. An alternative notation is CH–CH–OH, which indicates that the carbon of a methyl group (CH–) is attached to the carbon of a methylene group (–CH–), which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group (–OH). It is a constitutional isomer of dimethyl ether. Ethanol is often abbreviated as EtOH, using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group (CH) with Et.\\n\\nThe fermentation of sugar into ethanol is one of the earliest organic reaction employed by humanity. The intoxicating effects of ethanol consumption have been known since ancient times. In modern times, ethanol intended for industrial use is also produced from by-products of petroleum refining.\\n\\nEthanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. In chemistry, it is both an essential solvent and a feedstock for the synthesis of other products. It has a long history as a fuel for heat and light, and more recently as a fuel for internal combustion engine.\\n\\nEthanol has been used by humans since prehistory as the intoxicating ingredient of alcoholic beverage. Dried residue on 9,000-year-old pottery found in China imply that Neolithic people consumed alcoholic beverages.\\n\\nAlthough distillation was well known by the early Greeks and Arabs, the first recorded production of alcohol from distilled wine was by the School of Salerno alchemists in the 12th century. The first to mention absolute alcohol, in contrast with alcohol-water mixtures, was Raymond Lull.\\n\\nIn 1796, Johann Tobias Lowitz obtained pure ethanol by filtering distilled ethanol through activated charcoal. Antoine Lavoisier described ethanol as a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and in 1808 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure determined ethanol’s chemical formula. Fifty years later, Archibald Scott Couper published ethanol's structural formula. It is one of the first structural formulas determined.\\n\\nEthanol was first prepared synthetically in 1826 through the independent efforts of Henry Hennel in Great Britain and S.G. Sérullas inFrance. In 1828, Michael Faraday prepared ethanol by acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene, a process similar to current industrial ethanol synthesis.\\n\\nEthanol was used as lamp fuel in the United States as early as 1840, but a tax levied on industrial alcohol during the Civil War made this use uneconomical. The tax was repealed in 1906. Original Ford Model T automobiles ran on ethanol until 1908 With the advent of Prohibition in 1920, ethanol fuel sellers were accused of being allied with moonshine, and ethanol fuel fell into disuse until late in the 20th century.\\n\\nthumbEthanol is a volatile, colorless liquid that has a strong characteristic odor. It burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light.\\n\\nThe physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its hydroxyl group and the shortness of its carbon chain. Ethanol’s hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding, rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight.\\n\\nEthanol is a versatile solvent, miscible with water and with many organic solvents, including acetic acid, acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol, glycerol, nitromethane, pyridine, and toluene. It is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane and hexane, and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene.\\n\\nEthanol’s miscibility with water contrasts with that of longer-chain alcohols (five or more carbon atoms), whose water miscibility decreases sharply as the number of carbons increases. The miscibility of ethanol with alkane is limited to alkanes up to undecane, mixtures with dodecane and higher alkanes show a miscibility gap below a certain temperature (about 13 °C for dodecane). The miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes and the temperature for complete miscibility increases.\\n\\nEthanol-water mixtures have less volume than the sum of their individual components at the given fractions. Mixing equal volumes of ethanol and water results in only 1.92 volumes of mixture. Mixing ethanol and water is exothermic. At 298 K, up to 777 J/mol are set free.\\n\\nMixtures of ethanol and water form an azeotrope at about 89 mole-% ethanol and 11 mole-% water or a mixture of about 96 volume percent ethanol and 4% water at normal pressure and T = 351 K. This azeotropic composition is strongly temperature- and pressure-dependent and vanishes at temperatures below 303 K/\\n\\nthumbHydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be hygroscopic to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably sodium and potassium hydroxide, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, and sodium bromide. Sodium and potassium chloride are slightly soluble in ethanol. Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most essential oil and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.\\n\\nThe addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the surface tension of water. This property partially explains the “tears of wine” phenomenon. When wine is swirled in a glass, ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass. As the wine’s ethanol content decreases, its surface tension increases and the thin film “beads up” and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet.\\n\\nMixtures of ethanol and water that contain more than about 50% ethanol are flammable and easily ignited. Alcoholic proof is a widely used measure of how much ethanol (i.e., alcohol) such a mixture contains. In the 18th century, proof was determined by adding a liquor (such as rum) to gunpowder. If the gunpowder still burned, that was considered to be “100 degrees proof” that it was “good” liquor — hence it was called “100 degrees proof”.\\n\\nEthanol-water solutions that contain less than 50% ethanol may also be flammable if the solution is first heated. Some cooking methods call for wine to be added to a hot pan, causing it to flash boil into a vapor, which is then ignited to burn off excess alcohol.\\n\\nEthanol is slightly more refractive than water, having a refractive index of 1.36242 (at λ=589.3 nm and 18.35 °C).\\n\\nthumbEthanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Which process is more economical depends on prevailing prices of petroleum and grain feed stocks.\\n\\nEthanol for use as an industrial feedstock or solvent (sometimes referred to as synthetic ethanol) is often made from petrochemical feed stocks, primarily by the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene, represented by the chemical equation\\n\\nThe catalyst is most commonly phosphoric acid, adsorbed onto a porous support such as silica gel or earth. This catalyst was first used for large-scale ethanol production by the Shell Oil Company in 1947. The reaction is carried out with an excess of high pressure steam at 300 °C. In the U.S., this process was used on an industrial scale by Union Carbide Corporation and others; but now only LyondellBasell uses it commercially.\\n\\nIn an older process, first practiced on the industrial scale in 1930 by Union Carbide, but now almost entirely obsolete, ethylene was hydrated indirectly by reacting it with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce ethyl sulfate, which was hydrolysed to yield ethanol and regenerate the sulfuric acid:\\n\\nEthanol for use in alcoholic beverage, and the vast majority of ethanol for use as fuel, is produced by fermentation. When certain species of yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae) metabolize sugar they produce ethanol and carbon dioxide. The chemical equation below summarizes the conversion:\\n\\nThe process of culturing yeast under conditions to produce alcohol is called fermentation. This process is carried out at around 35–40 °C. Ethanol's toxicity to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing. The most ethanol-tolerant strains of yeast can survive up to approximately 15% ethanol by volume.\\n\\nTo produce ethanol from starchy materials such as cereal grain, the starch must first be converted into sugars. In brewing beer, this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate, or malt, which produces the enzyme amylase. When the malted grain is mashed, the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars. For fuel ethanol, the hydrolysis of starch into glucose can be accomplished more rapidly by treatment with dilute sulfuric acid, fungally produced amylase, or some combination of the two.\\n\\nSugars for ethanol fermentation can be obtained from cellulose. Until recently, however, the cost of the cellulase enzymes capable of hydrolyzing cellulose has been prohibitive. The Canadian firm Iogen brought the first cellulose-based ethanol plant on-stream in 2004. Its primary consumer so far has been the Canadian government, which, along with the United States Department of Energy, has invested heavily in the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol. Deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products, such as corncob, straw, and sawdust, into renewable energy resources. Other enzyme companies are developing genetically engineered fungi that produce large volumes of cellulase, xylanase, and hemicellulase enzymes. These would convert agricultural residues such as corn stover, wheat straw, and sugar cane bagasse and energy crops such as switchgrass into fermentable sugars.\\n\\nCellulose-bearing materials typically also contain other polysaccharide, including hemicellulose. When undergoing hydrolysis, hemicellulose decomposes into mostly five-carbon sugars such as xylose. S. cerevisiae, the yeast most commonly used for ethanol production, cannot metabolize xylose. Other yeasts and bacteria are under investigation to ferment xylose and other pentose into ethanol.\\n\\nOn January 14, 2008, General Motors announced a partnership with Coskata, Inc. The goal is to produce cellulosic ethanol cheaply, with an eventual goal of US$1 per U.S. gallon ($0.30/L) for the fuel. The partnership plans to begin producing the fuel in large quantity by the end of 2008. In June 2009, this goal is still ahead of the firm. By 2011 a full-scale plant will come on line, capable of producing 50 to 100 million gallons of ethanol a year (200–400 ML/a).\\n\\nthumbThe anaerobic bacterium Clostridium ljungdahlii, discovered in commercial chicken wastes, can produce ethanol from single-carbon sources including synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen that can be generated from the partial combustion of either fossil fuel or biomass. Use of these bacteria to produce ethanol from synthesis gas has progressed to the pilot plant stage at the BRI Energy facility in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The BRI technology has been purchased by INEOS.\\n\\nAnother prospective technology is the closed-loop ethanol plant. Ethanol produced from corn has a number of critics who suggest that it is primarily just recycled fossil fuels because of the energy required to grow the grain and convert it into ethanol. There is also the issue of competition with use of corn for food production. However, the closed-loop ethanol plant attempts to address this criticism. In a closed-loop plant, renewable energy for distillation comes from fermented manure, produced from cattle that have been fed the DDSG by-products from grain ethanol production. The concentrated compost nutrients from manure are then used to fertilize the soil and grow the next crop of grain to start the cycle again. Such a process is expected to lower the fossil fuel consumption used during conversion to ethanol by 75%.\\n\\nThough in an early stage of research, there is some development of alternative production methods that use feed stocks such as municipal waste or recycled products, rice hulls, sugarcane bagasse, small diameter trees, wood chips, and switchgrass.\\n\\nthumbBreweries and biofuel plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration. Infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the CH band at 2900 cm. This method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the CH band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content. The calculation makes use of the Beer-Lambert law. Alternatively, by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product, using a hydrometer, the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content. This inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry.\\n\\nEthylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanol–water mixture. For most industrial and fuel uses, the ethanol must be purified. Fractional distillation can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by volume (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of 78.1 °C, and cannot be further purified by distillation.\\n\\nCommon methods for obtaining absolute ethanol include desiccation using adsorbents such as starch, corn grits, or zeolite, which adsorb water preferentially, as well as azeotropic distillation and extractive distillation. Most ethanol fuel refineries use an adsorbent or zeolite to desiccate the ethanol stream.\\n\\nIn another method to obtain absolute alcohol, a small quantity of benzene is added to rectified spirit and the mixture is then distilled. Absolute alcohol is obtained in the third fraction, which distills over at 78.3 °C (351.4 K). Because a small amount of the benzene used remains in the solution, absolute alcohol produced by this method is not suitable for consumption, as benzene is carcinogenic.\\n\\nThere is also an absolute alcohol production process by desiccation using glycerol. Alcohol produced by this method is known as spectroscopic alcohol—so called because the absence of benzene makes it suitable as a solvent in spectroscopy.\\n\\nPure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily taxed, but ethanol has many uses that do not involve consumption by humans. To relieve the tax burden on these uses, most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink. These include bittering agents such as denatonium benzoate and toxins such as methanol, naphtha, and pyridine. Products of this kind are called denatured alcohol.\\n\\nAbsolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to ppm levels. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It may contain trace amounts of toxic benzene if azeotropic distillation is used to remove water. Absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol. Spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light, fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.\\n\\nPure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the USA, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system.\\n\\nRectified spirit, an azeotropic composition containing 4% water, is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes. Wine spirits are about 188 proof. The impurities are different from those in 190 proof laboratory ethanol.\\n\\nEthanol is classified as a primary alcohol, meaning that the carbon its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well. Many ethanol reactions occur at its hydroxyl group.\\n\\nIn the presence of acid catalysts, ethanol reacts with carboxylic acid to produce ethyl ester and water:\\n\\nThis reaction, which is conducted on large scale industrially, requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed. Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap. Ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids. Diethyl sulfate and triethyl phosphate are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and phosphorus pentoxide respectively. Diethyl sulfate is a useful ethylating agent in organic synthesis. Ethyl nitrite, prepared from the reaction of ethanol with sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid, was formerly a widely used diuretic.\\n\\nStrong acid desiccants cause the dehydration of ethanol to form diethyl ether and other byproducts. If the Temperature of the ethanol being dehydrated exceeds around 160 °C, ethylene will be the main product. Millions of kilograms of diethyl ether are produced annually using sulfuric acid catalyst:\\n\\nComplete combustion of ethanol forms carbon dioxide and water:\\n\\nEthanol is a neutral molecule and the pH of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly 7.00. Ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its conjugate base, the ethoxide ion (CHCHO), by reaction with an alkali metal such as sodium:\\n\\nor a very strong base such as sodium hydride:\\n\\nThe acidity of water and ethanol are nearly the same, as indicated by their pKa of 15.7 and 16 respectively. Thus, sodium ethoxide and sodium hydroxide exist in an equilbrium that is closely balanced:\\n\\nEthanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides, but the reactions are illustrative. Ethanol reacts with hydrogen halide to produce ethyl halides such as ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide via an sn2 reaction:\\n\\nThese reactions require a catalyst such as zinc chloride.HBr requires refluxing with a sulfuric acid catalyst. Ethyl halides can, in principle, also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized halogenating agents, such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus tribromide.\\n\\nUpon treatment with halogens in the presence of base, ethanol gives the corresponding haloform (CHX, where X = Cl, Br, I). This conversion is called the haloform reaction. \"An intermediate in the reaction with chlorine is the aldehyde called chloral:\\n\\nEthanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde and further oxidized to acetic acid, depending on the reagents and conditions. This oxidation is of no importance industrially, but in the human body, these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase. The oxidation product of ethanol, acetic acid, is a nutrient for humans, being a precursor to acetyl CoA, where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis.\\n\\nThe largest single use of ethanol is as a motor fuel and fuel additive. Brazil has the largest national fuel ethanol industry. Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25% anhydrous ethanol. Hydrous ethanol (about 95% ethanol and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new cars sold in the country. Brazilian ethanol is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration.  The U.S. uses Gasohol (max 10% ethanol) and E85 (85% ethanol) ethanol/gasoline mixtures.thumbEthanol may also be utilized as a rocket fuel, and is currently in lightweight rocket-powered racing aircraft.\\n\\nEthanol combustion in an internal combustion engine yields many of the products of incomplete combustion produced by gasoline and significantly larger amounts of formaldehyde and related species such as acetaldehyde. This leads to a significantly larger photochemical reactivity that generates much more ground level ozone. These data have been assembled into The Clean Fuels Report comparison of fuel emissions and show that ethanol exhaust generates 2.14 times as much ozone as does gasoline exhaust. When this is added into the custom Localised Pollution Index (LPI) of The Clean Fuels Report the local pollution (pollution that contributes to smog) is 1.7 on a scale where gasoline is 1.0 and higher numbers signify greater pollution. The California Air Resources Board formalized this issue in 2008 by recognizing control standards for formaldehydes as an emissions control group, much like the conventional NOx and Reactive Organic Gases (ROGs).\\n\\nthumbWorld production of ethanol in 2006 was , with 69% of the world supply coming from Brazil and the United States. More than 20% of Brazilian cars are able to use 100% ethanol as fuel, which includes ethanol-only engines and flex-fuel engines. Flex-fuel engines in Brazil are able to work with all ethanol, all gasoline or any mixture of both. In the US flex-fuel vehicles can run on 0% to 85% ethanol (15% gasoline) since higher ethanol blends are not yet allowed or efficient. Brazil supports this population of ethanol-burning automobiles with large national infrastructure that produces ethanol from domestically grown sugar cane. Sugar cane not only has a greater concentration of sucrose than corn (by about 30%), but is also much easier to extract. The bagasse generated by the process is not wasted, but is used in power plants as a surprisingly efficient fuel to produce electricity.\\n\\nthumbThe United States fuel ethanol industry is based largely on corn. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, as of October 30, 2007, 131 grain ethanol bio-refineries in the United States have the capacity to produce 7.0 billion US gallons (26 GL) of ethanol per year. An additional 72 construction projects underway (in the U.S.) can add 6.4 billion gallons of new capacity in the next 18 months. Over time, it is believed that a material portion of the ≈150 billion gallon per year market for gasoline will begin to be replaced with fuel ethanol.thumb\\n\\nOne problem with ethanol is that because it is easily miscible with water, it cannot be efficiently shipped through modern pipelines, like liquid hydrocarbons, over long distances. Mechanics also have seen increased cases of damage to small engines, particularly the carburetor, attributable to ethanol's increased water retention in fuel over time.\\n\\nEthanol is the principal psychoactive constituent in alcoholic beverage, with depressant effects on the central nervous system. It has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain; most notably ethanol acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Similar psychoactives include those that also interact with GABA receptors, such as gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Ethanol is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose and fatty acid metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis.\\n\\nAlcoholic beverages vary considerably in ethanol content and in foodstuffs they are produced from. Most alcoholic beverages can be broadly classified as fermented beverage, beverages made by the action of yeast on sugary foodstuffs, or as distilled beverage, beverages whose preparation involves concentrating the ethanol in fermented beverages by distillation. The ethanol content of a beverage is usually measured in terms of the volume fraction of ethanol in the beverage, expressed either as a percentage or in alcoholic proof units.\\n\\nFermented beverages can be broadly classified by the foodstuff they are fermented from. Beer are made from cereal grain or other starch materials, wine and cider from fruit juice, and mead from honey. Cultures around the world have made fermented beverages from numerous other foodstuffs, and local and national names for various fermented beverages abound.\\n\\nDistilled beverages are made by distilling fermented beverages. Broad categories of distilled beverages include whiskey, distilled from fermented cereal grains; brandies, distilled from fermented fruit juices, and rum, distilled from fermented molasses or sugarcane juice. Vodka and similar neutral grain spirits can be distilled from any fermented material (grain or potatoes are most common); these spirits are so thoroughly distilled that no tastes from the particular starting material remain. Numerous other spirits and liqueurs are prepared by infusing flavors from fruit, herb, and spice into distilled spirits. A traditional example is gin, which is created by infusing juniper berries into a neutral grain alcohol.\\n\\nIn a few beverages, ethanol is concentrated by means other than distillation. Applejack is traditionally made by freeze distillation, by which water is frozen out of fermented apple cider, leaving a more ethanol-rich liquid behind. Ice beer (also known by the German term Eisbier or more specifically as Eisbock) is also freeze-distilled, with beer as the base beverage. Fortified wine are prepared by adding brandy or some other distilled spirit to partially fermented wine. This kills the yeast and conserves some of the sugar in grape juice; such beverages are not only more ethanol-rich, but are often sweeter than other wines.\\n\\nAlcoholic beverages are sometimes used in cooking, not only for their inherent flavors, but also because the alcohol dissolves hydrophobic flavor compounds, which water cannot.\\n\\nJust as industrial ethanol is used as feedstock for the production of industrial acetic acid, alcoholic beverages are made into culinary/household vinegar: wine and cider vinegar are both named for their respective source alcohols, while malt vinegar is derived from beer.\\n\\nEthanol is an important industrial ingredient and has widespread use as a base chemical for other organic compounds. These include ethyl halide, ethyl ester, diethyl ether, acetic acid, ethyl amine and to a lesser extent butadiene.\\n\\nEthanol is used in medical wipes and in most common antibacterial hand sanitizer gels at a concentration of about 62% v/v as an antiseptic. Ethanol kills organisms by denaturing their protein and dissolving their lipid and is effective against most bacteria and fungi, and many virus, but is ineffective against bacterial spore.\\n\\nEthanol is sometimes used to treat poisoning by other, more toxic alcohols, in particular methanol and ethylene glycol. Ethanol competes with other alcohols for the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, lessening metabolism into toxic aldehyde and carboxylic acid derivatives, and reducing one of the more serious toxic effects of the glycols, their tendency to crystallize in the kidneys.\\n\\nEthanol is miscible with water and is a good general purpose solvent. It is found in paint, tincture, markers, and personal care products such as perfumes and deodorants. It may also be used as a solvent in cooking, such as in vodka sauce.\\n\\nBefore the development of modern medicines, ethanol was used for a variety of medical purposes. It has been known to be used as a truth drug (as hinted at by the maxim \"in vino veritas\"), as medicine for depression and as an anesthetic.\\n\\nEthanol was commonly used as fuel in early bipropellant rocket (liquid propelled) vehicles, in conjunction with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen. The German V-2 rocket of World War II, credited with beginning the space age, used ethanol, mixed with 25% of water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature. The V-2's design team helped develop U.S. rockets following World War II, including the ethanol-fueled Redstone rocket, which launched the first U.S. satellite. Alcohols fell into general disuse as more efficient rocket fuels were developed.\\n\\nEthanol binds to acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, and NMDA receptor.\\n\\nThe removal of ethanol through oxidation by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver from the human body is limited. Hence the removal of a large concentration of alcohol from blood may follow zero-order kinetics. This means that alcohol leaves the body at a constant rate, rather than having an elimination half-life.\\n\\nAlso, the rate-limiting steps for one substance may be in common with other substances. For instance, the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the biochemistry of methanol and ethylene glycol. In this way the oxidation of methanol to the toxic formaldehyde and formic acid in the (human body) can be prevented by giving an appropriate amount of ethanol to a person who has ingested methanol. Note that methanol is very toxic and causes blindness and death. A person who has ingested ethylene glycol can be treated in the same way.\\n\\nPure ethanol will irritate the skin and eyes. Nausea, vomiting and intoxication are symptoms of ingestion. Long term use by ingestion can result in serious liver damage.Atmospheric concentrations above one in a thousand are above the European Union Occupational exposure limit.\\n\\nEthanol is a central nervous system depressant and has significant psychoactive effects in sublethal doses; for specifics, see effects of alcohol on the body by dose. Based on its abilities to change the human consciousness, ethanol is considered a psychoactive drug. Death from ethyl alcohol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3–0.4%.\\n\\nThe amount of ethanol in the body is typically quantified by blood alcohol content (BAC), which is here taken as weight of ethanol per unit volume of blood. The table at right summarizes the symptoms of ethanol consumption. Small doses of ethanol generally produce euphoria and relaxation; people experiencing these symptoms tend to become talkative and less inhibited, and may exhibit poor judgment. At higher dosages (BAC > 1 g/L), ethanol acts as a central nervous system depressant, producing at progressively higher dosages, impaired sensory and motor function, slowed cognition, stupefaction, unconsciousness, and possible death.\\n\\nMore specifically, ethanol acts in the central nervous system by binding to the GABA-A receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e. it is a positive allosteric modulator).\\n\\nProlonged heavy consumption of alcohol can cause significant permanent damage to the brain and other organs. See Alcohol consumption and health.\\n\\nIn America, about half of the deaths in car accidents occur in alcohol-related crashes. The risk of a fatal car accident increases exponentially with the level of alcohol in the driver's blood. Most drunk driving laws governing the acceptable levels in the blood while driving or operating heavy machinery set typical upper limits of blood alcohol content (BAC) between 0.05% and 0.08%.\\n\\nDiscontinuing consumption of alcohol after several years of heavy drinking can also be fatal. Alcohol withdrawal can cause anxiety, autonomic dysfunction, seizures and hallucinations. Delirium tremens is a condition that requires people with a long history of heavy drinking to undertake an alcohol detoxification regimen.\\n\\nEthanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver, multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism.\\n\\nEthanol can intensify the sedation caused by other central nervous system depressant drugs such as barbiturate, benzodiazepine, opioid, phenothiazine and anti-depressants\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nSome individuals have less-effective forms of one or both of the metabolizing enzymes, and can experience more-severe symptoms from ethanol consumption than others. Conversely, those who have acquired alcohol tolerance have a greater quantity of these enzymes, and metabolize ethanol more rapidly.\\n\\nEthanol is classified as a teratogen. See fetal alcohol syndrome.\\n\\nFrequent drinking of alcoholic beverages has been shown to be a major contributing factor in cases of elevated blood levels of triglycerides.\\n\\nEthanol is not a carcinogen. However, the first metabolic product of ethanol, acetaldehyde, is toxic, mutagen, and carcinogenic.\\n\\nEthanol is produced naturally from the fermentation of overripe fruit by yeasts. Despite many reports to the contrary, there is little scientific evidence that animals seek out overripe fruit for its intoxicating effects; rather, it suggests that they instead actively avoid doing so. Ethanol is also produced during the germination of many plants as a result of natural anerobiosis. Ethanol has been detected in outer space, forming an icy coating around dust grains in interstellar cloud.\\n\\npnb:ایتھانولstq:Ethanol\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Etruscan shrew", "body": "The Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus), also known as the Etruscan pygmy shrew or the white-toothed pygmy shrew is the smallest known mammal by mass, weighing only about 1.8 gram on average (the Bumblebee Bat is regarded as the smallest mammal by skull size).\\n\\nThe Etruscan shrew has a body length of about 4 cm excluding the tail. It is characterized by very rapid movements and a fast metabolism, eating about 1.5–2 times its own body weight per day. It feeds on various small vertebrates and invertebrates, mostly insects, and can hunt individuals of the same size as itself. These shrews prefer warm and damp climates and are widely distributed in the belt between 10° and 30°N latitude stretching from Europe and North Africa up to Malaysia. They are relatively rare and are endangered in some countries.\\n\\nthumbThe Etruscan shrew has a slender (not truncated) body with a length between 3 and 4.5 cm excluding the tail. The tail is longer than half of the body. The body mass varies between 1.3 and 2.4 grams and is usually about 1.8 grams. The head is relatively large, with a long mobile proboscis, and the hind limbs are relatively small. The Etruscan shrew has a very fast heart beating rate, up to 1511 beats/min (25 beats/s) and a relatively large heart muscle mass, 1.2% of body weight. The fur color on the back and sides is pale brown, but is light gray on the stomach. The shrew usually has 30 teeth, but the 4th upper intermediate tooth is very small (rudimentary), and is absent in some individuals. Near the mouth growth a dense array of short whiskers, which the shrew actively uses in searching for prey, especially in the night. There is no clear difference in body features between males and females.\\n\\nThe Etruscan shrew live alone, except during mating periods. Their lifetime is estimated as 2 years, but with a large uncertainty. They protect their territory by making chirping noises and signs of aggressiveness. They tend to groom themselves constantly when not eating and are always moving when awake and not hiding. The hiding periods are short and typically last less than half an hour. A clicking sound is heard when these shrews are moving, which ceases when they rest. The shrews are more active during the night when they make long trips; during the day, they stay near the nest or in a hiding place. They reach their maximum level of activity at dawn.\\n\\nThe movements of the Etruscan shrew are rapid, with a rate of about 780 min (13 s). In cold seasons and during shortages of food, the shrews lower the body temperature down to about 12 °C and enter a state of temporary hibernation to reduce energy consumption. The recovery from this state is accompanied by shivering with the frequency of about 3500 min (58 s). This induces heating with the rate up to 0.83 °C/min, which is among the highest values recorded in mammals; the heart rate increased exponentially with time from 100 to 800–1200 beats/min, and the respiratory rate rises linearly from 50 to 600–800 beats/min.\\n\\nThe Etruscan shrew apparently breed all year round with gestation period of about 28 days and bring 2–6 cubs per litter. Most pregnancies occur between October and December. Cubs are born naked and blind, but quickly develop, becoming independent and sexually mature at 3–4 weeks of age.\\n\\nThe Etruscan shrew inhabits a belt extending between 10° and 40°N latitude across Eurasia. In Southern Europe, it has been found in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Turkey, with unconfirmed reports in Andorra, Gibraltar and Monaco; it has been introduced by humans to some European islands, such as Canary Islands.\\n\\nThe shrew also occurs in Northern Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia) and around Arabian Peninsula (Bahrain, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Syria, and Yemen including Socotra). In Asia, it was observed in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Borneo, Bhutan, China (Gengma County only), Burma, Georgia, Guinea, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia (Malaysian part of Borneo island), Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Vietnam. There are unconfirmed reports of the Etruscan shrew in West and East Africa (Guinea, Nigeria, Ethiopia) and in Armenia, Brunei, Indonesia, Kuwait and Uzbekistan.\\n\\nThe shrew is relatively rare, especially in Azerbaijan, Georgia (included into the Red Book), Jordan and Kazakhstan (Red Book). Even where not endangered, its density is always lower than of the other shrews living in the area.\\n\\nThe Etruscan shrew favors warm and damp habitats covered with shrubs, which it uses to hide from predators. It is usually confined to the foothills and lower belts of mountain ranges, though has been found up to 3,000 m above sea level. It colonizes riparian thickets along the banks of lakes and rivers, as well as human-cultivated areas (abandoned gardens, orchards, vineyards, olive groves edges of fields). The shrew however avoids intensively cultivated areas, as well as dense forests sand dunes. It is poorly adapted to digging burrows and therefore arranges its nests in various natural shelters, crevices and others uninhabited burrows.\\n\\nBecause of their high ratio of surface area to body volume, the Etruscan shrew have an extremely fast metabolism and have to eat 1.5–2 times their body weight in food per day. They feed up to 25 times per day, mostly on various invertebrates (insects, their larvae, earthworms, etc.) as well as small vertebrates (young frogs, lizards and rodents), and can hunt prey of nearly the same body size as themselves. They prefer species with a soft and thin exoskeleton and for this reason avoid ants when given a choice. They kill large prey by a bite to the head and eat them immediately, whereas they take small insects back to their nest. When hunting, the Etruscan shrew mostly rely on their sense of touch rather than vision and may even run into their food at night. The Etruscan shrew might play important role in controlling the insect population.\\n\\nThe largest threat to the Etruscan shrew originates from human activities, particularly destruction of their nesting grounds and habitat as a result of farming. The Etruscan shrew is also sensitive to climate changes such as cold winters and dry periods. Major predators are birds of prey, especially owl.\\n\\nShrew, EtruscanShrew, Etruscan\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eunice Murray", "body": "Eunice R. Murray (March 3, 1902 - March 5, 1994) is notable for being Marilyn Monroe's housekeeper who was present in the actress' house at the time she died there. Eunice Murray has been accused by many tabloid authors and LAPD Sergeant Jack Clemmons of being involved in a cover-up of Monroe's death, No one has proven such innuendo or explained what motive she might have had for conspiring with police officials, U.S. government officials or criminals.\\n\\nShe was born Eunice Joerndt in Chicago and raised in Urbana, Ohio, as a Swedenborgian. She was educated at the Swedenborgian Urbana School and Academy until she dropped out at age sixteen in 1918. In 1921, she married John Murray and went on to have three children with him: Jaquelyn, Patricia and Marilyn. By the end of the Second World War in 1945, the Murrays were living in Santa Monica in a Monterrey-style five-bedroom house, which, after she and her husband separated, Eunice sold to psychiatrist Ralph Greenson in 1946. Greenson and other psychiatrists subsequently hired Eunice Murray as a support worker for some of their most prestigious client. Murray never identified any psychiatrists for whom she may have worked besides Greenson, nor is it known which prestigious people, if any, she may have helped besides Monroe. It is not clear what her husband John Murray did for a living or when he died.\\n\\nIn 1961, it was speculated Dr. Ralph Greenson advised Marilyn Monroe, then living in an apartment on North Doheny Drive in Beverly Hills, to recruit Murray as a housekeeper/companion. When Monroe decided to buy a house, it was believed by some that Murray located the small dwelling, which had no closets, on Fifth Helena Drive in Brentwood in which Monroe was to spend the last months of her life. After Monroe moved into it, Murray began spending many nights there, although she kept an apartment in nearby Santa Monica. Murray began (according to the testimonies of Monroe's friends) reporting to Greenson on the actress' daily activities. Murray accompanied Monroe on her publicized visit to Mexico in February 1962, even introducing the star to some openly communist people south of the border whose association with Monroe caused the FBI to investigate the actress as a possible risk to national security.\\n\\nPart of tabloid speculation was that in an attempt to assert her independence from Greenson, Monroe fired Murray in May 1962 but shortly afterward rehired her. However, in August 1962 when Murray requested a month's holiday, Monroe granted it, paid her, and one writer added that she asked her not to return. After spending Friday night, August 3, 1962 at her apartment, Murray arrived at Monroe's house the next day for her last contracted day of work, just hours before Monroe died. Murray said consistently to police and reporters in 1962 and to author Robert Slatzer in 1973 that she and Monroe, the only people in the house, retired to their separate rooms late Saturday evening with Monroe aware that she would be spending the night. When Murray awoke at approximately 3:00 a.m. and knocked on Monroe's door, the actress did not answer. In a 1975 memoir, Murray changed her story slightly, recalling that the sight of a telephone extension cord running under Monroe's bedroom door caused her, at approximately 3:00 a.m., to use another extension to call Dr. Greenson. (In 1962 she had told police that she had contacted Greenson after becoming alarmed by Monroe's bedroom light shining through the space under the door.) In 1985 Murray made major changes to her story by claiming that Robert Kennedy was in the house at some point on Saturday and that \"the doctor\" arrived to help Monroe while she was unconscious but alive. Murray never said, however, that Monroe might have wanted her out of the house.\\n\\nMurray never wavered in her claim that during her telephone conversation with Greenson, he instructed her to go outside and look through Monroe's bedroom window. Murray then supposedly (not verified) saw the actress lying \"in an unnatural position,\" reported this to Greenson and he arrived at the house, broke the window and entered Monroe's room aware that she was dead.\\n\\nMany days later, when Murray attempted to cash her last paycheck from Monroe, it was declined and marked \"deceased.\" This check, one of the last that Monroe ever wrote on her Roxbury Drive Branch account at City National Bank in Beverly Hills, is today on display at the Hollywood Heritage Museum.\\n\\nAfter Monroe's death, Murray lived quietly in various locations in West Los Angeles. From the mid 1960s until the mid 1970s, Murray rented a guest cottage in Santa Monica from relatives of the actor, Richard Cromwell, who had died in 1960. While there in 1973, she was interviewed by Robert Slatzer. In a photograph of them together that is published in his 1974 book The Life and Curious Death of Marilyn Monroe, Murray appears to be laughing.\\n\\nDuring her years in the guest cottage she pursued her many interests, including sewing, macrame, horticulture, astrology, and tutoring. In the late 1970s she married Franklin Blackmer, a Swedenborgian minister, and moved east with him to Bath, Maine. After his death, she returned to her family in Southern California, living close to Monroe's former home in Brentwood. A crew from the BBC videotaped Murray talking inside \"a rundown apartment in Santa Monica\" in 1985, according to Anthony Summers, who was interviewing her. Later, Murray lived with her daughter in Tucson, Arizona, until her death in July 1993.\\n\\nAfter Slatzer found her and talked with her, Eunice Murray published a 1975 memoir, Marilyn: The Last Months (co-authored by Rose Shade) and later talked with other biographers and journalists, including Anthony Scaduto, about Monroe. It was not until she met Anthony Summers, however, that she admitted that Marilyn Monroe had known the Kennedys or that \"the doctor\" had been in the star's house while she was unconscious but alive. Donald Wolfe, an author who began work on The Last Days of Marilyn Monroe shortly before Murray's death, theorized that everything in her story was a lie, including her retiring for bed late Saturday evening (with Monroe's approval) and the 3:00 a.m. awakening and phone call to Dr. Greenson. Wolfe based the theory on an interview he conducted with a man who had been Murray's son-in-law in 1962. When the man, whose first and last name are unknown Fnu Lnu, told Wolfe his story in 1992, he was using a wheelchair in his Arkansas home. He died within a year, as did Eunice Murray in July 1993.\\n\\nDonald Spoto, working on a Monroe biography in the early 1990s and Rachael Bell, making a television documentary years later, both speculated without proof that Murray was covering up an inadvertently fatal dose of a sedative that a well-meaning person had given a despondent Monroe by enema. Although Spoto and Bell did not investigate the story together, they agree that Murray had no connection to U.S. government officials or criminals. Barbara Leaming, whose Monroe biography came out within weeks of Wolfe's, does not believe that Eunice Murray played a sinister part in the events surrounding Monroe's death.\\n\\nEunice Murray initially repeated the same story she had told Robert Slatzer in 1973 and the police in 1962. She apparently noticed the camera crew starting to pack up and then said, \"Why, at my age, do I still have to cover this thing?\"[9] Unknown to her, the microphone was still on. Murray went on to admit that Monroe had known the Kennedys.[10] She volunteered that on the night of the actress' death, \"When the doctor arrived, she was not dead.\" Murray died on March 5, 1994 without revealing further details.FBI documents detail Murray as a suspect in the Monroe murder, implicating her along with Dr. Greenson and publicist Pat Newcombe was her murderers.\\n\\n"}

The trial that followed in the fall of 1929 found Pantages guilty and he was sentenced to 50 years in prison.He was successful, however, on appeal.\\n\\nHollywood myth alleges that Pringle was to be paid $10,000 dollars to enter Pantages's office and accuse him of rape so that Joseph P. Kennedy, the patriarch of the famous American family, would buy the Pantages theatre chain (Pantages adamantly refused to sell him the chain when Kennedy approached him). \\n\\nWhat is known is that the trial brought notoriety to Pantages and sympathy to Pringle. Newspapers at the time, thanks to the arrival of tabloid newspapers in the USA in 1919, already convicted Pantages before the trial even started in September 1929. Particularly virulent was the Los Angeles Examiner owned by press baron William Randolph Hearst. \\n\\nThe conviction destroyed Pantages's business. Despite his success on appeal he sold his chain to Kennedy's RKO and Warner Bros. Pringle's life would also never be the same. Wanting nothing more to do with show business or the press, she simply disappeared from sight. In 1935, Pringle married Robert White, the heir to a furniture business. After divorcing White, she married Richard Ellis Worthington, a psychologist, in 1947. They lived in Chicago for several years before moving to San Diego County in 1955. The couple had one child, a daughter, Marcy. She died in 1996, aged 84.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "EurOmnis", "body": "EurOmnis is a week-long technical conference held annually in Europe for developers of the Omnis Studio application development tool. The conference is organised for and by the Omnis developer community and is an opportunity for developers to exchange their knowledge and experiences of using the Omnis Studio development environment. The conference features speakers from around the world who are regarded by the Omnis developer community as experts in their chosen field and who agree to share their knowledge freely and on an impartial basis. The current conference is organised by long-term Omnis developer Fred Brinkman, but has featured many other developers on the organisation team. \\n\\nIn past years the EurOmnis conference has followed a structured session-based programme, but starting in 2007 centres on smaller sessions that encourage more two-way communication. Main goal for the format change is offering new ways for conference attendees to really learn. The only track to remain in structured sessions is the so-called ‘Studio 101 Course’, usually held by David Swain, author, trainer and long-term Omnis developer, which shows beginners the basics of using Omnis Studio to develop enterprise applications. \\n\\nEurOmnis was created in 1999 by Fred Brinkman and Nick Harris as a forum for Omnis developers from all over the world to learn and develop new ideas and techniques for using Omnis Studio. It was the follow-up of a highly successful conference put together by Bruno Huyssen in 1998, a conference now known in the Omnis developer community as 'The Woodstock' of all Omnis conferences. \\n\\nIn March 2002 the conference format was brought to London, Ontario, in Canada by David Ferri, Cliford Illkay and Fred Haislmaier under the AmerOmnis Banner. Again one year later the EurOmnis format was ported to Australia, laying the foundations for the OzOmnis conferences.\\n\\nIn 2003 Gavin Foster took over as joint organizer of EurOmnis as Fred Brinkman retired from the role due to other obligations, in 2007 the latter returned as conference organizer, deploying the 'EurOmnis, The Next Generation'-concept, abandoning the 'class'-format and introducing smaller and more intimate sessions, giving attendees a possibility to choose topics of interest and put together their own conference. EurOmnis, The Next Generation presents attendees with opportunities to get the information they want or solve the problems they have. Formal conferences have never been a place to solve problems but a place to listen to people doing presentations. EurOmnis, The Next Generation, changed that.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eureka Springs, Arkansas", "body": "Eureka Springs is a city in Carroll County, Arkansas, United States, one of the two county seat for the county. It is located in the Ozark Mountains of northwest Arkansas. According to 2006 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the town is 2,350. The entire town of Eureka Springs is on the National Register of Historic Places as the Eureka Springs Historic District and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Arkansas.\\n\\nEureka Springs is a unique Victorian resort village in Carroll County, Arkansas which has its own culture and lifestyle. The city has steep winding streets filled with Victorian-style cottages and manors. The old commercial section of the city has an alpine character, with an extensive streetscape of well-preserved Victorian buildings. The buildings are primarily constructed of local stone and lie along streets that curve around the hills and rise and fall with the topography in a five-mile long loop. Some buildings have street-level entrances on more than one floor. The local Catholic Church boasts a street-level entrance to its bell tower. Eureka Springs has been selected as one of America's Distinctive Destinations by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\\n\\nMost of the stores and shops in the commercial district are locally owned and managed. They consist primarily of specialty shops featuring local crafts, antiques, the works of local artists, and standard Ozark tourist fare. The downtown area also features various coffee shops and sidewalk cafés. The town has more than 20 art galleries in the downtown area. The city maintains a trolley service providing transportation around town for the tourists who visit the town.\\n\\nThe city hosts the 7-story tall, 2 million pound, white concrete statue of Jesus known as Christ of the Ozarks, erected privately in 1966 as part of a planned religious theme park. The statue sits across the valley from the downtown area and is visible from many points in the immediate area. The city is home to The Great Passion Play. The play is \"America's #1 attended Outdoor Drama,\" according to the Outdoor Institute of Drama at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Celebrating its 40th season in 2008, the play will welcome its 7.5 millionth visitor.\\n\\nRipley's Believe It or Not has noted numerous details about the city: The Basin Park Hotel is built on a hill, so that people can enter from ground level at all eight stories. The Palace Bath House has the first neon sign west of the Mississippi River. Penn Memorial Baptist Church connects to three different streets at three different levels and has three addresses. St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church is the only church that is entered through the bell tower. The town's winding, hilly, curved streets form 16 \"S's\", a large \"O\", and numerous \"U's\" and \"V's,\" yet the town has no perpendicular street crossings.\\n\\nIt is home to one of few outdoor staircases not attached to a street that is considered a street by the United States Postal Service. Having no level spot in town large enough for a rodeo, circus, or baseball diamond was another fact that Ripley included. (A stadium was built in 1948 after an area had been made level enough, but this was torn down and an athletic field, known as Van Pelt Stadium, was built in the 1980s).\\n\\nThe Eureka Springs area had a reputation as a destination for people seeking health well before the first European American pioneers reached Arkansas. Several old Native American legends tell of a Great Healing Spring in the Eureka Springs area.\\n\\nThis reputation continued as Europeans arrived and the waters of the springs gained a reputation of having magical powers. Within a short time Eureka Springs was transformed into a flourishing city, spa, and tourist destination. Dr. Alvah Jackson first located the spring and claimed that the waters of Basin Spring had cured his eye ailments in 1856. Dr. Jackson established a hospital in a local cave during the American Civil War and used the waters from Basin Spring to treat his patients. After the war Jackson marketed the spring waters as \"Dr. Jackson's Eye Water.\" The Ozarka Water Company was later formed in Eureka Springs in 1905.\\n\\nIn 1879 Judge J.B. Saunders, a friend of Jackson, claimed that his crippling disease was cured by the spring waters. Saunders started promoting Eureka Springs to friends and family members across the State and created a boomtown. Within a period of little more than one year, the city grew from a rural spa village to a major city of 10,000 people, most of which were visitors.\\n\\nThere are stories of Jesse James and his gang using the area as a hideout. Carry A. Nation moved here towards the end of her life and founded Hatchet Hall on Steele St., which is closed as a museum today. Bonnie and Clyde also went through Eureka Springs. The only bank robbery Eureka Springs had was September 27, 1922, when five outlaws from Oklahoma tried to rob the First National Bank, three of which were killed, and the other two wounded. None of the five was either Bonnie or Clyde.\\n\\nOn 14 February 1880 Eureka Springs was incorporated as a city. Thousands of visitors came to the springs based on Saunders' promotion and covered the area with tents and shanties. The U S Census never exceeded 5,000 people, and in 1880 it was 3,984; in 1890 it was 3,706; in 1900 it was 3,572; and went down from there. A special census was done in the 1880s showing 5,000 people, in addition to thousands of visitors. In 1881 Eureka Springs enjoyed the status of Arkansas's fourth largest city, and in 1889 it was the second largest city behind Little Rock.\\n\\nAfter his term as a Reconstruction Governor, Powell Clayton moved to heavily Unionist Eureka Springs and began promoting the city and its commercial interests. Clayton promoted the town as a retirement community for the wealthy. Eureka Springs soon became known for gracious living and a wealthy lifestyle.\\n\\nThe town's most famous citizen was Claude Albert Fuller, who rose from one of the poorest families in town to become one of the most powerful politicians, not only in Arkansas, but in the United States of America from 1898 to 1938. A book has been written about his life story, \"Backwoods Baron\" by Frank L. Beals, and he is also in the Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture (encyclopediaofarkansas.net).\\n\\nIn 1882 the Eureka Improvement Company was formed to attract a railroad to the city. With completion of the railroad, Eureka Springs established itself as one of the premier vacation resorts of the Victorian era. It had thousands of homes and commercial enterprises constructed in only two years. The Crescent Hotel was built in 1886 and the Basin Park Hotel in 1905. These many Victorian buildings have been well preserved, forming a coherent streetscape that has been recognized for its quality.\\n\\nThe city is also the site of Thorncrown Chapel, an award-winning contemporary building designed by E. Fay Jones and constructed in 1980. The chapel was selected for the 2006 \"Twenty-five Year Award\" by the American Institute of Architects, which recognizes structures that have had significant influence on the profession. Because of the special nature of its high quality of architecture, the chapel was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\\n\\nrightEureka Springs has a unique eclectic mix of people and lifestyles. The city is proud of its reputation as a diversity haven for those of all walks of life. It was home to WPA-era muralist Louis Freund (one of his murals may be viewed at the Bank of Eureka Springs), jeweler Elsa Freund (named one of the foremost jewelry designers of the 1950s), novelist Constance Wagner, painter Tommy Thomas, and many others. Later, culinary writer and children's book author Crescent Dragonwagon, dubbed by USA Today \"the most interesting person in Eureka Springs\", made her home there for 33 years. With her late husband Ned Shank, she co-founded both the first bed-and-breakfast inn in the town, Dairy Hollow House, and later the non-profit Writer's Colony at Dairy Hollow.\\n\\nThe town has also remained a premier destination for religious tourists visiting various Christian-themed attractions, including the Little Portion Hermitage , founded by prominent Christian musician John Michael Talbot.\\n\\nEureka Springs hosts a variety of events throughout the year. The town is a popular destination for artists, motorcyclists, poets, church groups, and sculptors from around the world.\\n\\nBlues (with such names as Taj Mahal, Muddy Waters, Ray Charles and Keb' Mo' performing), jazz, folk, and classical music, are each celebrated with a weekend dedicated to the particular genre each year. Each summer, Opera in the Ozarks presents full operatic productions with orchestra and a cast of pre-professional students.\\n\\nA well-attended poetry festival is held each year. There is extensive local theater, with many productions held at the large stone auditorium, built in the city's downtown in 1929 and inaugurated with a concert by John Phillip Sousa.\\n\\nThousands visit Eureka Springs each year for the Christian outdoor performance of \"The Great Passion Play. The city also boasts an annual UFO conference and several motorcycle and auto shows, including a Mustang show in April, Corvette show the first weekend in October and a Volkswagen show in August.\\n\\nThe film Pass the Ammo, featuring Annie Potts, Tim Curry, and Bill Paxton, was filmed in the city, with the Auditorium featured in several scenes. There are burn marks still visible on the Auditorium from the film's special effects. The movie Chrystal, with Billy Bob Thornton, was filmed in Eureka Springs. Parts of the movie Elizabethtown starring Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst were filmed in Eureka Springs as well as Oklahoma City and Guthrie, along with the more obvious locations in Kentucky. The 1982 mini series \"The Blue and the Gray\" was also filmed around the area. The SciFi Channel's reality series Ghost Hunters investigated the Crescent Hotel during episode 13 of the second season.\\n\\nEach May, Eureka Springs hosts the May Fine Arts Festival, a celebration of the art, music, and creativity that is one of the defining features of the Eureka community.The festival begins in the first weekend in May with the Artrageous Parade, a collection of all things artsy. Some additional events during the festival include:A Gallery Stroll, takes place during the second Saturday of each month and allows viewers to tour the galleries in town and meet the artists featured within each gallery and a PT Cruiser's show on the second Saturday.Shakespeare in the Ozarks, an outdoor Shakespeare in the Park festival, opens its first summer season in 2010, plus Books in Bloom, a Grand Illumination, White Street Studio Walk, and ART Car Festival highlight events during the month.Every weekend, Basin Park hosts Music in the Park, an opportunity for live music and festivities.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nEureka Springs is located at  (36.403068, -93.738450). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.9 square miles (17.9 km²), of which, 6.8 square miles (17.6 km²) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.4 km²) of it (2.02%) is water.\\n\\nThe city was originally founded when the hot springs at this location were more evident. Over-extraction of hot water from the springs has greatly diminished their flow rates. As with many natural hot springs, the hot springs here are a location of extremophile biota occurrence.\\n\\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,278 people, 1,119 households, and 569 families residing in the city. The population density was 336.2 people per square mile (129.7/km²). There were 1,301 housing units at an average density of 192.0/sq mi (74.1/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 93.94% White, 0.04% Black or African American, 0.70% Native American, 0.79% Asian, 0.09% Pacific Islander, 2.28% from other races, and 2.15% from two or more races. 3.99% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\\n\\nThere are 1,119 households, of which 19.2% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.4% were married couples living together, 10.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 49.1% are classified as non-families by the United States Census Bureau. Of 1,119 households, 54 are unmarried partner households: 36 heterosexual, 10 same-sex male, and 8 same-sex female households. 41.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.97 and the average family size was 2.64.\\n\\nIn the city the population was spread out with 17.2% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 24.4% from 25 to 44, 33.4% from 45 to 64, and 19.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46 years. For every 100 females there were 81.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 81.2 males.\\n\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $25,547, and the median income for a family was $40,341. Males had a median income of $27,188 versus $17,161 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,439. About 4.4% of families and 12.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.7% of those under age 18 and 13.0% of those age 65 or over.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "European Convention on Nationality", "body": "The European Convention on Nationality (E.T.S. No. 166, signed in Strasbourg, 6 November 1997) is a comprehensive convention of the Council of Europe dealing with the law of nationality.\\n\\nCommon practice among states at the beginning of the 20th century was that a woman was to have the nationality of her husband; thus upon marrying a foreigner she would automatically acquire the nationality of her husband, and lose her own nationality. Even once the nationality of a married woman was made no longer dependent on the nationality of her husband, legal provisions were still retained automatically naturalising married women, and sometimes married men as well. This could lead to a number of problems, including loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations. For these reasons, the Convention provides that neither marriage nor dissolution of marriage shall automatically affect the nationality of either spouse (article 4d).\\n\\nArticle 5 provides that no discrimination shall exist in a state's internal nationality law on the grounds of \"sex, religion, race, colour or national or ethnic origin\". It also provides that a state shall not discriminate amongst its nationals on the basis of whether they are naturalised or native-born citizen.\\n\\nArticle 6 relates to the acquisition of nationality. It provides for nationality to be acquired at birth by descent from either parent to those born within the territory of the state. (States may exclude partially or fully children born abroad). It also provides for nationality by virtue of birth in the territory of state; however, states may limit this to only children who would be otherwise stateless. It requires the possibility of naturalisation, and provides that the period of residence required for eligibility cannot be more than ten years lawful and habitual residence. It also requires to \"facilitate\" the acquisition of nationality by certain persons, including spouses of nationals, children of its nationals born abroad, children one of whose parents has acquired the nationality, children adopted by a national, persons lawfully and habitually resident for a period before the age of eighteen, and stateless person and refugee lawfully and habitually resident on its territory.\\n\\nArticle 7 regulates the involuntary loss of nationality. It provides that states may deprive their nationals of their nationality in only the cases of voluntary acquisition of another nationality, fraud or failure to provide relevant information when acquiring nationality, voluntary military service in a foreign military force, or adoption as a child by foreign nationals. It also provides for the possibility of loss of nationality for nationals habitually residing abroad. Finally it provides loss of nationality for \"conduct seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the State Party\".\\n\\nArticle 8 provides nationals with the right to renounce their nationality, providing they do not thereby become stateless. States may however restrict this right with respect to nationals residing abroad.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "European Monetary System", "body": "There are three stages of monetary cooperation in the European Union.\\n\\nEuropean Monetary System (EMS) was an arrangement established in 1979 under the Jenkins European Commission where most nations of the European Economic Community (EEC) linked their currencies to prevent large fluctuations relative to one another. \\n\\nAfter the demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, most of the EEC countries agreed in 1972 to maintain stable exchange rate by preventing exchange rate fluctuations of more than 2.25% (the European \"currency snake\"). In March 1979, this system was replaced by the European Monetary System, and the European Currency Unit (ECU) was defined.\\n\\nThe basic elements of the arrangement were:\\n\\nAlthough no currency was designated as an anchor, the Deutsche Mark and German Bundesbank were unquestionably the centre of the EMS. Because of its relative strength, and the low-inflation policies of the bank, all other currencies were forced to follow its lead. This situation led to dissatisfaction in most countries, and was one of the primary forces behind the drive to a monetary union (ultimately the euro).\\n\\nPeriodic adjustments raised the values of strong currencies and lowered those of weaker ones, but after 1986 changes in national interest rate were used to keep the currencies within a narrow range. In the early 1990s the European Monetary System was strained by the differing economic policies and conditions of its members, especially the newly reunified Germany, and Britain (which had initially declined to join and only did so in 1990) permanently withdrew from the system in September 1992. Speculative attack on the French Franc during the following year led to the so-called Brussels Compromise in August 1993 which established a new fluctuation band of +15%.\\n\\nFor more information see Black Wednesday\\n\\nThe European Monetary System was no longer a functional arrangement in May 1998 as the member countries fixed their mutual exchange rates when participating in the euro. Its successor however, the ERM-II, was launched on 1 January 1999. In ERM-II the ECU basket was discarded and the new single currency euro has become an anchor for the other currencies participating in the ERM 2. Participation in the ERM 2 is voluntary and the fluctuation bands remain the same as in the original ERM, i.e. +15 percent, once again with the possibility of individually setting a narrower band with respect to the euro. Denmark and Greece became new members.\\n\\nThe EMS-2 is sometimes described as \"waiting room\" for joining the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union. In the EMU (stage III) the actual currencies in the participating member states are replaced by euro banknotes and coins; thus, entering the Euro Zone.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "European Sexuality leading up to and during World War II", "body": "In the inter-war period saw great change in the sexual habits of European societies.\\n\\nthumbThe German birth rate like most industrial nations had been falling for decades. When Hitler and his Nazis took power in 1933 they embarked among several revolutionary policies in order to change the sexual practices of the German people and reverse this slide in the birth rates. At the same time that it forbid the mixing of Jewish and German through the Nuremberg Laws, Nazi policy tried a number of policies designed to increase new births. One action was to change the marriage laws via the 1938 divorce-reform law by the Minister of Justice, Dr Gurtner. Within two years 30,000 divorces were filed 80% of which were husbands casting off women over 45-years old. While the divorce law increased new marriages and children from these marriages the Nazis looked to Illegitimate births in Germany as a way to increase Germany's birthrate.\\n\\nIn the 1920s there were about 150,000 illegitimate births in Germany before halving during the depression and bouncing up to 100,000 in 1935. The Nazis wanted to increase the illegitimate births by encouraging out of wedlock births especially those of Aryan heritage. Part official policy, part propagandist the Nazi policy manifested itself in the Lebensborn program. The Lebensborn program provided a place where pregnant mothers could have their babies out of wedlock in secret.\\n\\nOnly chose the most \"pure\" of its applicants to join its programs. Of all the women who applied, only 40 percent passed the racial purity test (They had to show their family tree three generations back) and were granted admission to the Lebensborn program. The majority of mothers were unmarried, 57.6 percent until 1939, and about 70 percent by 1940.\\n\\nThe Lebensborn program was further given a push when Himmler issued a proclamation that every SS soldier should father a child before he left for war. The child could then be born and raised at the Lebensborn facilities. Through these policies the birth rate did increase and Himmler told his doctor Kerstern how proud he was to have a role in the change, \"Only a few years ago illegitimate children were considered a shameful matter ... [now] my men tell me with shinning eyes that a son has been born to them. Their girls consider it an honour, not a source of shame.\" \\n\\nOnce World War II broke out and men were sent to the front the Nazis changed their promise of every woman will have a man to every woman will have a child. A report to the Ministry of Justice in 1944 stated that:\\n\\nAs a mark of how much sexual attitudes had changed by the end of the war 23% of all young Germans were infected with a veneral disease, and prostitution had quadrupled. Had the Germans triumphed Himmler and Bormann were considering a post-war institution of double marriage for Nazi party officials and war heroes.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Euthenics", "body": "Euthenics deals with human improvement through altering external factors such as education and the controllable environment, including the prevention and removal of contagious disease and parasites, environmentalism, education regarding home economics, sanitation, and housing.\\n\\nThe term was derived in the late 19th century from the Greek verb \"euthenein\": \"thrive\", \"flourish\". Ellen Swallow Richards (1842–1911) was one of the first writers to use the term, in The Cost of Shelter (1905), with the meaning \"the science of better living\".\\n\\nEuthenics is distinguished from eugenics primarily in that the latter is concerned with the improvement of the human species through the manipulation of genetic inheritance (using various techniques of selective breeding), while euthenics is concerned with uninheritable improvements in human beings at a particular time and place, though this can have genetic consequences. For example, while eugenics would typically deal with the problem of an inheritable disease such as thalassemia by sterilising sufferers, or by limiting their reproductive rights through legislation, euthenics would approach the problem through allocating more resources to screening for the disease and by education, giving sufferers the chance to make informed decisions about whether or not to have children. \\n\\nThe result of the euthenics approach would thus have long-term, genetic effects, but would achieve them very differently from eugenics.\\n\\nMany who support eugenics believe that euthenics is ultimately pointless, or at least less effective than eugenics, because it deals with the consequences of a problem rather than the problem itself. Those who support euthenics argue that eugenic approaches work by taking choices – and especially reproductive choices – away from people, while euthenics allows people to make better-informed decisions, as in the example of genetic diseases.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Evangelist portrait", "body": "thumbEvangelist portraits are a specific type of miniature included in ancient and mediæval illuminated manuscript Gospel Book, and later in Bible and other books, as well as other media. Each Gospel of the Four Evangelists, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, may be prefaced by a portrait of the Evangelist, usually occupying a full page. Their symbols may be shown with them, or separately. Often this is the only figurative illumination in the manuscript. They are a common feature in larger Gospel Books from the earliest examples in the 7th century until the decline of that format for illustrated books in the High Middle Ages, by which time their conventions were being used for portraits of other authors. thumb\\n\\nThey originate in the classical secular tradition of the author portrait, which was often the only illustration in a classical manuscript, also used as a frontispiece (not unlike the contemporary author photo, though this is usually shown on the back cover or wrapper). A very few examples of Late Antique secular author portraits survive, and rather more later copies. Some examples also draw on the conventions of the Late Antique consular portrait, much used for the Emperors, who were also consul. Examples of these, copied from the original, can be seen in the Chronography of 354 (see also the Missorium of Theodosius I of 30 years later). The Evangelist may be holding a book, but is not writing in it, and he faces the front on a large throne, surrounded by an elaborate frame, usually domed or pedimented. These frameworks are thought to draw from the style of the Scaenae frons, or elaborate proscenium structures of Roman theatre.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe traditional symbols of the Evangelists were often included in the images, or especially in the Insular tradition, either given their own additional images on a separate page, or used instead of an evangelist portrait. The symbols are: the Lion of Mark, the Eagle of John, the Ox or Calf of Luke and the Angel or Man of Matthew. Often all are shown with wings, as in the familiar winged lion used in the coat of arms of Venice, whose patron saint was Mark. Sometimes, as in the example from Lorsch, the symbols are shown dictating the text to the evangelist.\\n\\nLate Antique evangelist portraits often show standing figures, as in the ivory panels of the Throne of Maximianus in Milan, but from the Insular art of the 7th to 10th centuries, evangelist portraits in manuscripts nearly always closely followed the seated classical models, showing the Evangelists at full-length, either looking out at the viewer or writing at a table or desk and seen at an oblique angle. These were derived from unknown classical prototypes, similar to those in the Codex Amiatinus and Saint Augustine Gospels, though both of these types are rather different from the general types. Usually a setting is provided for the figure. Details of the classical models, such as anachronistic scroll and scroll-boxes, and a small writing-stand with a single dolphin-shaped support (see gallery below), survive well into the Middle Ages, sometimes clearly misunderstood by the artists concerned. Perhaps because of the secular origins of the typology, haloes are less likely to be worn than in other types of image. The level of detail shown in the furniture and fittings is unusual for Early Medieval art. An arch behind the author, often with curtains hanging across it, in some examples close to the classical models, gradually is turned into a decorative framing device for the whole scene.\\n\\nEarly Gospel Books often had a very elaborate and costly cover in metalwork, often with jewels and ivories. These most often featured a central panel with Christ in Majesty, often including the Evangelists and/or their symbols in the corners. Versions of the same composition appear in all media used for Early Medieval religious art, including wall paintings. The Tassilo Chalice is an 8th century example of pure metalwork with five oval medallion portraits of Christ and the Evangelists (with symbols) round the cup.\\n\\nthumbThe early artists of the Insular period often show evangelists from the front who appear to be standing, although a chair is drawn behind them; the human figure was not a focus of interest or skill for these artists. Later Insular depictions seem to show figures without chairs, who are standing. Most of Europe continued to use the seated model however, usually seen in a three-quarters on view, and usually with a cushion behind. Sometimes all four evangelists were combined on a page, sometimes around a Christ in Majesty. Standing portraits were usual, however, for wall and later panel paintings (and in the Tree of Jesse composition) with the Evangelists often treated as, and mixed with, other saints. \\n\\nThe Gospel book as a medium for heavily illustrated manuscripts declined in the West from the Romanesque period, and with it the use of the Evangelist portrait. In the Eastern Orthodox world, the Gospel Book remained a primary focus for illumination, and Evangelist portraits, derived from contemporary Byzantine versions, are heavily represented among the earliest illuminations from the new Slav national traditions, such as the 11th century Ostromir Gospels and the Khitrovo Gospels of about 1390 from Muscovy. In the West the portraits continued to be found in Bibles, more often as the picture within a historiated initial at the start of each Gospel. Other books sometimes contained them as well. Similar compositions began to be used for other saint-authors, especially for St Jerome, who is often shown in a book-lined study, often with his symbol, also a lion, dozing at his feet, and for St Gregory the Great, shown with a dove, representing his inspiration from the Holy Spirit, whispering in his ear.\\n\\n"}

Its name is derived from the combination of the Biblical \"Eve\" and the r from robot.\\n\\nEveR-1 is a direct competitor of Actroid, which is being developed by Kokoro Dreams and Osaka University of Japan, and was unveiled at the International Robot Exhibition in Tokyo in 2003. EveR-1 was built in a year at a cost of 300 million won (US$321,000) in state funds.\\n\\nThe creators said the humanoid's face is a composite of two well-known Korean actresses, while the torso is based on a singer, though the names of the celebrities were not revealed. The android weighs 50 kilograms and has a height of 160 centimeters.\\n\\nThe creators also said that EveR-1 can mimic the human emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise more naturally than its Japanese rival, while using a hydraulic system for certain movements. EveR-1 contains a total of 35 miniature motors located throughout its upper body, which enables EveR-1 to move its head, arms, and upper body and even move its lips in synchronization with the robot's speech.

{"title": "Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer", "body": "Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, GCB, OM, GCMG, KCSI, CIE, PC, FRS (26 February 1841 – 29 January 1917), was a British statesman, diplomat and colonial administrator.\\n\\nHe was British controller-general in Egypt during 1879, part of the international Control which oversaw Egyptian finances after the khedives' mismanagement, and during the British occupation prompted by the Urabi revolt, agent and consul-general in Egypt from 1883 to 1907. Far from the centre of the Empire, Cromer ran the territory with great drive and his effective governance balked British wishes to withdraw from Egypt.\\n\\nEvelyn Baring (1841–1917) was the ninth son of Henry Baring and his second wife, Cecilia Anne (Windham). The English Baring family descends from John (née Johan) Baring, who emigrated from Germany in 1717. John's son Sir Francis was the founder of Barings Bank. Henry was the third son of Sir Francis. When he died in 1848, young Evelyn, then seven years old, was sent to boarding school. At fourteen, he entered the Royal Military Academy, graduating at seventeen with a lieutenant's commission in the Royal Artillery. He was initially posted to a battery on the island of Corfu. \\n\\nWhile on Corfu, Baring became aware of his own lack of education, and began a campaign of self-education, learning Greek and fluent Italian. He also took a mistress, and fathered an illegitimate daughter, Louisa Sophia. In 1862, he accepted a position as aide-de-camp to Sir Henry Storks, High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. This position ended in 1864, with the union of Corfu to Greece. Later in 1864, Storks was appointed governor of Malta, again employing Baring as an aide-de-camp. The next year Baring accompanied Storks to Jamaica, where Storks headed the official inquiry into the Morant Bay rebellion. In 1868, Baring was selected to attend the Army's Staff College; he graduated in late 1869. He then worked for two years in the War Office, helping to implement post-Crimean War reforms.\\n\\nBaring went to India in 1872 as private secretary to his cousin Lord Northbrook, Viceroy of India. With Northbrook's resignation in 1876, Baring returned to England. He received the C.S.I., and was promoted to major. Baring married Ethel Errington in 1876. In 1877 he retired from the army.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIsmail Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, borrowed millions of pounds from European financiers for projects to build the Suez Canal, his personal use, and to cover persistent tax shortfalls. His finances depended on money obtained from Egypt's cotton industry, which flourished during the American Civil War. Yet, after the war, as American cotton entered European markets once again, the price of cotton fell dramatically. As a result, Egypt's cotton was no longer the cash crop it used to be. Ismail Pasha found himself unable to even pay off the interest on his debts.\\n\\nAt first, Ismail attempted to call on his parliament to raise more tax money, but parliament resisted, as it made up mostly of large landowners, who were lightly taxed. In desperation, Ismail turned to the European powers to help him out of his financial troubles. After some rocky negotiations the Dual Control system was instituted, whereby a French and a British controller were appointed to oversee Egypt's finances. Sir Evelyn Baring was appointed as the British Controller. Egyptian historian Al-Sayyid Marsot considers this desperate attempt on Ismail's part to obtain European help to have opened the floodgates for the British control of Egypt's finances, and eventual incorporation into their empire.\\n\\nAs the British Controller-General, Baring was enormously successful in serving British interests. He and his fellow controller's de facto control of Egypt's finances meant they wielded considerable influence in both the Egyptian and British governments. Owning a large proportion of Egypt's debt himself, when Ismail refused to declare bankruptcy, Baring pressured his government to depose Ismail, which they did in 1879. This came with little fuss from the general populace as most of the country blamed Ismail for the country's financial struggles. Ismail was succeeded by his son Tawfiq, who cooperated with the European consuls.\\n\\nthumbThe Urabi Revolt, led by Ahmed Urabi, a rising Egyptian colonel, endangered the Khedivate. After the subsequent intervention by the British in Alexandria (the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War), Baring returned from India in Egypt as the British agent and consul-general, \"with a mandate for minor reforms and a prompt withdrawal of British troops\". Baring's requests to withdraw were thwarted by British public outcry when the 1881 uprising of the Madhi Muhammad Ahmad and the ensuing Mahdist War caused the successive defeats & deaths of the popular Colonel William Hicks and General Chinese Gordon.\\n\\nBaring’s first act as Consul-General was to approve of the Dufferin Report, which essentially called for a puppet parliament with no power. In addition, the report asserted the need for British supervision of reforms deemed necessary for the country. Furthermore, it stated the interests of the Suez Canal zone should always be maintained. Baring believed that because of Egyptian administrative incompetence, a long occupation was essential to any sort of reform. Moreover, he established a new guiding principle for Egypt known as the Granville Doctrine (named for the Foreign Secretary, Lord Granville). The doctrine enabled Baring and other British officials to dismiss Egyptian ministers who refused to accept British directives. Under Baring, British officials were positioned in key ministries and a new system, known as the Veiled Protectorate, was introduced. Essentially, the government was a façade. Egyptians ministers were the outward form, yet British officials held the actual power. Despite these measures, the Khedive sanctioned the system. The Egyptian army, which Baring considered utterly untrustworthy due to its previous mutinies against the Khedive, was disbanded and a new army organized along with British lines (much like in India).\\n\\nAfaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot contends that under Baring, Egyptian nationalists were inert and many Egyptians believed in Britain’s policy of \"rescue and retire\", but that Baring had no intention of doing so as, Marsot says, \"Baring believed that 'subject races' were totally incapable of self-government, that they did not really need or want self-government, and that what they really needed was a 'full belly' policy which kept it quiescent and allowed the elite to make money and so cooperate with the occupying power.\"\\n\\nIn 1906, Baring was made a Member of the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. \\n\\nBaring was embroiled in controversy in both Egypt and Britain in the wake the severe punishments meted out to Egyptian peasants following the 1906 Denshawai Incident. In April 1907, he resigned office, having held the post of British agent in Egypt for twenty-four years. The official reason given for his resignation was his poor health. In July 1907, parliament awarded him £50,000 in recognition of his \"eminent services\" in Egypt.\\n\\nBaring returned to Britain at the age of 66, and spent a year regaining his health. In 1908, he published, in two volumes, Modern Egypt (Vol 1 & Vol 2), a narrative of events in Egypt and the Sudan since 1876. In 1910, he published Ancient and Modern Imperialism, an influential comparison of the British and Roman Empires. In 1914, World War 1 broke out. The Khedive Abbas II supported the Ottomans, and was deposed by the British. This freed Baring to publish his impressions of the Khedive, Abbas II, in 1915.\\n\\nBaring was active in politics. Having been raised to the peerage as Lord Cromer in 1892, Baring was entitled to sit in the House of Lords. He joining the free-trade wing of the Unionist party. Baring was a leader of the anti-suffragette cause, serving as the president of the Men's League for Opposing Woman Suffrage in 1908, then in 1910-12, the subsequent National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage. In 1916, Baring was appointed to the Dardanelles Commission but died before the signing of the first report.\\n\\nHis brother was Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke.

It offers six Bachelors of Applied Science degrees: 1) Animation and Visual Effects, 2) Digital Filmmaking, 3) Game Art & Design, 4) Interactive Audio, 5) Motion Graphic Design and 6) Sound Arts. Ex'pression awards bachelor's degree after 36 months of accelerated education.\\n\\nEx’pression College for Digital Arts was founded by Gary Platt, a sound recording engineer and educator, and Eckart Wintzen, a Dutch venture capitalist and media arts enthusiast. A  building was purchased in Emeryville, California to house a new school to be called \"Ex’pression Center for New Media\". Ex’pression hired architect John Storyk, to help design the facility which houses the school. Building began in November 1998.\\n\\nOn September 9, 1998, Ex’pression received temporary approval from the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education (BPPVE) to operate, and to offer course instruction in digital visual media and sound comprehensive programs. The BPPVE granted Ex’pression temporary approvals to operate and offer diploma, associates and bachelor degree programs in September 1998. In January 2001, Ex’pression was granted approval to operate, and renewed the approval to operate in October 2005.\\n\\nOn January 11, 1999, 48 students began classes in Sound Arts and Digital Visual Media, the first two programs offered by the school. \\n\\nIn 2004, the school had more than 500 students enrolled. The same year, its name was changed from 'Ex’pression Center for New Media to Ex’pression College for Digital Arts. The change reflects a stronger emphasis on Bachelor degree level learning and more accurately describes the core focus of the College’s curriculum in digital arts.\\n\\nIn April 2005, the school became an accredited college with the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology (ACCSCT).\\n\\nIn August 2005, Ex’pression was formally recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and approved to participate in the Title IV Federal Student Aid programs such as Stafford Loan, Pell Grant, and PLUS Loan.\\n\\nIn November 2006, Ex’pression was approved by the State of California’s Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education to offer its fourth BAS degree in Game Art and Design\\n\\nIn December 2006, Ex'pression received approval to offer the Game Art and Design BAS program from the ACCSCT.\\n\\nIn early 2007, Ex’pression expanded its facilities adding an additional , creating several new classrooms. Work is currently taking place on further extensions to this wing.\\n\\nEx'pression has gained a reputation for having a challenging lab and class schedule. The school essentially operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with students in class or lab for 4 hours at a time; lectures generally take place between the hours of 9:00am and 9:00pm, while labs run throughout the day. Many classes will have a three hour lecture, a one hour break, and then a four hour lab. \\n\\nEx'pression’s degree programs start monthly. Throughout the course of a program, the average Ex'pression student will have two courses at one time, with one course occurring on three days a week and the other course occurring on two or three depending on the class. This course load can fluctuate, however, according to the student’s program and month.\\n\\nCourses are five weeks long, and new courses start every five weeks. This schedule allows Ex'pression a fluid, if intense, operating method. If a student fails a class, they will be allowed to take it again with no charge, one time. Further class retakes are not covered, and must be paid for by the student.\\n\\nStudent life, like the school itself, is different from a typical college. Since a new class starts every five weeks, classmates who start at the same time frequently stay together throughout the program (and sometimes assign a name to their group). This is desired, as one of the school's focuses is putting out small teams of graduates who know each other and have worked together, so that they can get group internship. Class sizes vary from 10 to 35 students, with a maximum number of 50 students in classes where students from different degree programs are combined, mostly the general education subjects.\\n\\nThere are several groups and clubs within the different degree programs of the school, each oriented toward student interests. Students in the relevant degree program generally manage the groups, with an instructor providing support.\\n\\nEx'pression does not have on-campus student housing but works with Collegiate Housing Services to offer housing for students. CHS offers a shared housing program for new and current students. CHS will also help students find alternative housing through their referral program. Most students live within  of the school in apartment complexes in the immediate area, often with roommates.\\n\\nEx'pression college's tuition is currently set at $84,320 along with several non-refundable fees. If the tuition is not paid in full at the time of enrollment, then the student is subject to a periodic tuition increase, which has been occurring almost annually. Tuition was increased to $19,900 per academic year on April 13, 2009, and again on April 12, 2010 to $21,080 per academic year.\\n\\nEx'pression is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology, which is a national accreditor of primarily vocational schools and career schools within the United States. Most four year colleges and universities in the U.S. are regionally accredited, and do not recognize national accreditation such as ACCSCT (see ). The ACCSCT's accredditation review process \"relies heavily on the integrity of the information submitted by institutions... through a process of self-evaluation.\" \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Excavate", "body": "The excavates are a major kingdom of unicellular eukaryote, often known as Excavata. The phylogenetic category Excavata, proposed by Cavalier-Smith in 2002, contains a variety of free-living and symbiotic forms, and also includes some important parasites of humans.\\n\\nMany excavates lack 'classical' mitochondria - these organisms are often referred to as 'amitochondriate', although most, perhaps all, retain a mitochondrial organelle in greatly modified form. Others have mitochondria with tubular, discoidal, or in some cases, laminar crista. Most excavates have two, four, or more flagella and many have a conspicuous ventral feeding groove with a characteristic ultrastructure, supported by microtubule. However, various groups that lack these traits may be considered excavates based on genetic evidence (primarily phylogenetic trees of molecular sequences). \\n\\nThe closest that the excavates come to multicellularity are the acrasid slime mould. Like other cellular slime mould, they live most of their life as single cells, but will sometimes assemble into a larger cluster.\\n\\nExcavates are classified into four major subgroups at the phylum/superphylum level. These are shown in the table below.\\n\\nHeterolobosea (Percolozoa) and Euglenozoa appear to be particularly close relatives, and are united by the presence of discoid crista within the mitochondria (Superphylum Discicristata). More recently a close relationship has been shown between Discicristata and Jakobida. Most jakobids have tubular cristae, like most other protists, while the metamonads are unusual in having lost classical mitochondria—instead they have 'hydrogenosomes', 'mitosomes' or uncharacterised organelles. In addition to the groups mentioned in the table above, the genus Malawimonas is generally considered to be a member of Excavata owing to its typical excavate morphology, and phylogenetic affinity to excavate groups in some molecular phylogenies. However, its position among excavates remains elusive.\\n\\nExcavate relationships are still uncertain; it is possible that they are not a monophyletic group. The monophyly of the excavates is far from clear, although it seems like there are several clades within the excavates which are monophyletic.\\n\\nCertain excavates are often considered among the most primitive eukaryote, based partly on their placement in many evolutionary trees. This could encourage proposals that excavates are a paraphyletic grade that includes the ancestors of other living eukaryotes. However, the placement of certain excavates as 'early branches' may be an analysis artifact caused by long branch attraction, as has been seen with some other groups, for example, microsporidia.\\n\\n*\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Exchange-traded note", "body": "An exchange-traded note (or ETN) is a senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt security issued by an underwriting bank. Similar to other debt securities, ETNs have a maturity date and are backed only by the credit of the issuer. \\n\\nETNs are designed to provide investors access to the returns of various market benchmarks. The returns of ETNs are usually linked to the performance of a market benchmark or strategy, less investor fees. When an investor buys an ETN, the underwriting bank promises to pay the amount reflected in the index, minus fees upon maturity. Thus ETN has an additional risk compared to an ETF - upon any reduction of credit ratings or if the underwriting bank goes bankrupt, the value of the ETN will be eroded.\\n\\nThough linked to the performance of a market benchmark, ETNs are not equities or index fund, but they do share several characteristics of the latter. Similar to equities, they are traded on an exchange and can be shorted. Similar to index funds, they are linked to the return of a benchmark index. But as debt securities, ETNs don't actually own anything they are tracking.\\n\\nThe first ETN, marketed as the iPath Exchange-Traded Notes, was issued by Barclays Bank PLC on 12 June 2006. This was soon followed by Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs & Swedish Export Credit Corp. In 2008, additional issuers entered the market with their own offerings; these include BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. As of April 2008, there were 56 ETNs from nine issuers tracking different indexes. The popularity of ETNs is mainly due to the advantages that it offers to investors. \\n\\nThe returns of ETNs are linked to the performance of a market benchmark or strategy, less investor fees.\\n\\nAs discussed previously, ETNs are debt notes. When held to maturity, the investor will receive a cash payment that is linked to the performance of the corresponding index during the period beginning on the trade date and ending at maturity, less investor fees. Typically, ETNs do not offer principal protection.\\n\\nETNs could also be liquidated before their maturity by trading them on the exchange or by redeeming a large block of securities directly to the issuing bank. The redemption is typically on a weekly basis and a redemption charge may apply, subjected to the procedures described in the relevant prospectus. \\n\\nThe investor fee is calculated cumulatively based on the yearly fee and the performance of the underlying index and increases each day based on the level of the index or currency exchange rate on that day. Because the investor fee reduces the amount of return at maturity or upon redemption, if the value of the underlying decreases or does not increase significantly, the investor may receive less than the principal amount of investment at maturity or upon redemption. \\n\\nSince ETNs are unsecured, unsubordinated debts, they are not rated, but are backed by the credit of underwriting banks. Like other debt securities, ETNs do not have voting rights. Unlike other debt securities, interest is not be paid during the term of most ETNs.\\n\\nETN offers a tax-efficient way to invest. It is treated for tax purposes as prepaid contracts (A prepaid contract is a financial instrument, such as a forward contract. The owner of a prepaid contract pays an initial amount in order to receive a future contingent payment based on the value of an index or other underlying benchmark at a specified time). \\n\\nVery often index mutual funds and ETFs are required to make yearly income and capital gains distributions to fund holders which are taxable. Meanwhile, for ETF, when a fund is forced to sell stock to change its composition, for example, when an index rebalances, the fund holders have to pay tax on whatever the capital gain was, when the stock is sold. \\n\\nIn contrast, for ETN, there is no interest payment and dividend distribution, so neither is there a tax. The timing of the realization of gains or losses on their ETN is based on when investors buy and sell their investment. Since the entire gain is treated as a capital gain, the investor can defer any gain until the security is either sold or it matures. Because long-term capital gains are treated more favorably (Holding more than 1 year, all the gains will be taxed as long-term gains at 15%) than short-term capital gains and interest, the tax treatment of ETNs should be more favorable than that of ETFs. There is no way to avoid capital gains, but delaying it is valuable because the amount that would have been paid as tax can continue to accumulate wealth. Control over the timing of this capital gain is a big benefit to any investor looking to defer the payment of income taxes. \\n\\nRecent tax rulings have additionally suggested that ETNs may be qualified tax shelters for the purpose of changing current interest income into deferred capital gains income.\\n\\nETNs give investors a broad-based index without any tracking error to the index, doing away with the discrepancies that exist between the returns of many ETFs and their underlying indexes. One reason of the tracking error observed in ETFs might be attributed to the diversification issues that stem from the inability of a fund to replicate an index due to an upper limit on the maximum asset allocation to a single stock. But for ETN, this constraint does not exist, because though ETN is also tracking the index, the return is not based on the underlying securities. The ETN issuer guarantees the holder a return that is an exact replica of the underlying index, minus expense fees. The bank also agrees to pay large shareholders the exact value of the note on a weekly basis through redemption, which helps the ETNs track very closely to the underlying index return.\\n\\nETNs are a significant innovation to improve liquidity of structured product. Unlike other buy-and-hold structured products, ETNs can be bought and sold during normal trading hours on the securities exchange. For institutional size redemption, investors may offer their ETN for repurchase by the issuer on a weekly basis. Investors can easily track the performance of their ETN. In this sense, ETNs are structured to resemble ETFs. But ETNs are different from ETFs, as they consist of a debt instrument with cash flows derived from the performance of an underlying asset – a structured product.\\n\\nETNs have provided access to hard-to-reach exposures, such as commodity futures and the Indian stock market. Certain asset classes and strategies are not easily accessible to individual investors. For example, the “momentum investing” strategy, which is used in SPECTRUM Large Cap U.S. Sector Momentum Index, is to take advantage of the varied performances of the 10 sub-indexes of the S&P 500 Total Return IndexSM (SPTR) relative to each other and to the SPTR. The weights of the 10 sub-indexes are computed each day based on performance and correlation. This makes SPECTRUM Large Cap U.S. Sector Momentum Index difficult to track through ETF. On the contrary, ETN provides opportunities to gain exposure to these types of investment strategies in a cost-efficient way.\\n\\nETNs, as debt instruments, are subject to risk of default by the issuing bank as counter party. This is the major design difference between ETFs and ETNs: ETFs are only subject to market risk whereas ETNs are subject to both market risk and the risk of default by the issuing bank. Even though the possibility of default turning into a reality is relatively low, it ought to be measured and accounted for. ETN investors will require a credit risk metric that facilitates answer to questions regarding the magnitude of the risk and its variation with time. With new players foraying into the ETN space, how will the risk vary by issuer? Who will take up the risk evaluation process? If and when the ETN sector grows, in order to participate, retail and institutional investors will need a source for ETN key data which is easy to assimilate.\\n\\nGiven its relative newness, there is a flurry of ETNs hitting the market. They are, however, yet to engage the market players enthusiastically, several of whom are probably opting for the wait and watch approach. Under such circumstances, the liquidity of the notes in the secondary markets may be threatened should they fail to gain sufficient trading momentum. The effectiveness of ETNs at tracking indices is contingent on their ability to garner enough support in the market. \\n\\nAnother flipside of ETNs relates to their redemption feature. While ETNs can be sold daily on the secondary markets or held until maturity, institutional investors who wish to redeem blocks of 50,000 units or more directly with the issuer can only do so once a week. In contrast, other structured products, ETFs for instance, can be redeemed anytime during a trading day.\\n\\nThe ETN issuers are using tax efficiency as their trump card. As things stand, there is significant tax saving to be gained from investing in ETNs. In reality, however, the Internal Revenue Service has yet to decide on the proposed tax treatment. So, the tax benefit status is still arguable.\\n\\nETNs have their worth decided by two factors:\\n\\n•\\tPerformance of the index they are set to track\\n\\n•\\tCredit ratings of the issuer\\n\\nSuppose the issuing bank has been impacted negatively, if only marginally, by a crisis like the recent (2007-2008) subprime mortgage turmoil and the ratings agencies depreciate the overall credit rating of the issuer to reflect the event.\\n\\nIn the aforementioned set-up, even though the index it is tracking is showing growth, a decline in rating of an ETN issuing financial institution could negate the worth of an ETN.\\n\\nThe GSCI has lost nearly 20% of its value since January 2006, despite soaring commodity prices, all thanks to Contango. This is one instance where ETN tracked commodity indices like GSCI have ended up doing exactly the opposite of what they had set out to do.\\n\\nContango is a scenario where the cost of the next-month futures contract is costlier than the current month contract. In this event, the issuing bank books a loss each time a current month contract is sold and the next month contract is bought. Contango has hit hard the energy futures over the past few years and markedly brought down the returns from energy markets.Indices are taking varied steps to hedge against the condition. Their results remain to be seen.\\n\\nThe UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index (CMCI) addresses the issues of contango and backwardation by introducing the concept of constant maturity, which provides diversification across futures contract maturity dates. This is intended to smooth out the volatility often associated with commodity investments.\\n\\nAs a new product, ETN has a very short history. However, it has been growing very rapidly. The ETN represents a nifty product structure that is gaining respect and funding in the market. By 18 July 2006, just one month after the launch of first two ETNs, GSP and DJP, GSP had attracted more than $40 million in assets, and DJP had pulled in more than $130 million for Barclays. Investments in iPath ETNs surpassed $2 billion by late April 2007. In just over a year Barclays has gathered close to $3 billion in eight funds. Encouraged by the good performance of the ETNs launched by Barclays, other financial institutions have either launched their own products or are drawing plans to partake of the ETN space. We believe more ETNs will be launched to raise more equity for financial institutions. For the customers, the advantages such as tax-efficiency and good liquidity of ETNs will attract more investors to this innovative structured product. All of these imply that ETN is becoming more and more popular. \\n\\nHowever, now the question is whether this trend is going to last long. Several industry gurus point to factors that may well dampen the initial euphoria surrounding this product of financial engineering. The lack of historical record – upon which to base their decision to make ETN a part of their portfolio or not – could be keep potential investors at bay. More importantly, the issuing banks advertise tax-efficiency as ETNs USP. If the IRS rules in the issuers’ favor, the implications of which have been discussed at length in Chapter 3, ETN sales could explode. But what if the IRS delivers an unfavorable word-or never rules? A line of thought that is doing rounds is that even if the IRS delivers an unfavorable word-or never rules at all-the ETNs could still be enormously successful. The reason is that ETNs provide efficient access to segments of the market that would otherwise be difficult for retail investors to reach. But how could we expect that the investors would still prefer ETNs to ETFs, or any of the multitudes of other structured products out in the market, if there is no tax-efficiency for ETNs. Drawing a comparison to ETFs, another structured product, which suffers from only market risk, ETNs face both counter party risk and market risk. ETNs, bereft of their tax advantage, may lose their shine in the eyes of an entire class of investors. \\n\\nTo conclude, ETNs have performed very well so far as a new kind of structured product with lower fees, better liquidity and tax-efficiency. However, both financial institutes and investors should keep an eye on the status of the tax opinion from the IRS on ETNs while seeking ETNs as business or investment possibilities.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n"}

Integer spin particles do not change the sign of their wave function upon a 360 degree rotation—therefore the sign of the wave function of the entire system does not change. Semi-integer spin particles change the sign of their wave function upon a 360 degree rotation (see more in spin-statistics theorem).\\n\\nParticles for which the wave function does not change sign upon exchange are called bosons, or particles with a symmetric wave function. The particles for which the wave function of the system changes sign are called fermion, or particles with an antisymmetric wave function.\\n\\nFermions therefore obey different statistics (called Fermi-Dirac statistics) than bosons (which obey Bose-Einstein statistics). One of the consequences of Fermi-Dirac statistics is the exclusion principle for fermions—no two fermions can share the same quantum state (in other words, the wave function of two fermions in the same state is zero). This in turn results in degeneracy pressure for fermions—the strong resistance of fermions to compression into smaller volume. This resistance gives rise to the “stiffness” or “rigidity” of ordinary atomic matter (as atoms contain electrons which are fermions).\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Execution Dock", "body": "250pxThe Execution Dock is located on the Thames in the Wapping area of London, England, United Kingdom. It was used for more than 400 years (as late as 1830) to hang pirates, smuggler and mutineer that had been sentenced to death by Admiralty court. \\n\\nthumbThe Admiralty only had jurisdiction over crimes on the sea, so the dock was placed within their jurisdiction just off-shore beyond the low-tide mark. Those sentenced to death would be taken from Marshalsea Prison and paraded across London Bridge past the Tower of London before being publicly executed at the dock. Prisoners, prior to execution, were paired with a chaplain who encouraged them to confess their sins. They were then led onto the dock for sentence to be carried out.\\n\\nWith a particular cruelty, for those convicted of piracy, hanging was done with a shortened rope. This meant a slow death from asphyxiation on the scaffold as the drop was insufficient to break the neck. It was called the Marshal's dance because the body's limbs would often be seen to 'dance'. After execution, the bodies were not cut down, unlike the hangings on land such as at Tyburn. Instead it was customary for the corpses to remain until at least three tides had washed over their heads. The worst offenders were then tarred and gibbet at Graves Point - the entrance to the River Thames - as a warning to all seafarers about the fate awaiting those who pursued piracy.\\n\\nAn account from The Gentleman's Magazine, dated February 4, 1796, gives a vivid portrayal of a typical execution at London's Execution Dock.\\n\\nThe notorious Captain Kidd, who had been convicted of piracy and murder, was taken from Newgate Prison and executed at the dock in 1701. During his execution, the rope broke and Kidd was hanged on the second attempt. His body was left gibbeted in an iron cage by the River Thames for more than twenty years.\\n\\nGeorge Davis and William Watts were the final hangings at the dock on December 16, 1830.\\n\\n200pxSome sources state there is a large E on the Thames side of the building at Swan Warf (80 Wapping High Street?) that indicates where Execution Dock once stood. Another source states it was approximately where the small Underground station now stands, about two-thirds of the way along Wapping High Street going east.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Expanded access", "body": "Expanded access refers to the use of an investigational drug outside of a clinical trial by patients with serious or life-threatening conditions who do not meet the enrollment criteria for the clinical trial in progress. This type of access may be available, in accordance with FDA regulations, when it is clear that patients may benefit from the treatment, the therapy can be given safely outside the clinical trial setting, no other alternative therapy is available, and the drug developer agrees to provide access to the drug. The FDA refers to such a program as an expanded access program (EAP). EAPs can be leveraged in a wide range of therapeutic areas including HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, cancer, rare diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, to name a few.There are several types of EAPs allowed in the United States. Treatment protocols and treatment INDs provide large numbers of patients access to investigational drugs. A single-patient IND is a request from a physician to the FDA that an individual patient be allowed access to an investigational drug on an emergency or compassionate use basis. When the FDA receives a significant number of requests (~10 to 100) for individual patient expanded access to an investigational drug for the same use, they may ask the trial sponsor to consolidate these requests, creating an intermediate-size group. “Compassionate use” is a more colloquial term that is not generally used by the FDA.\\n\\nSince 1987, the FDA has had rules in place that have enabled patients, under specific circumstances, to access drugs or biologics that are still in development for treatment purposes. These expanded access program rules were amended in 2009 by the FDA to ensure “broad and equitable access to investigational drugs for treatment.”\\n\\nThe regulations include the following: \\n\\nThe regulations also include general criteria for granting expanded access:\\n\\nDespite the updated regulations, debate remains over key elements of expanded access: \\n\\nA number of challenges can exist when patients seek access to investigational drugs: \\n\\nOutside the U.S., programs that enable access to drugs in the pre-approval and pre-launch phase are referred to by a variety of names including “named patient programs,” “named patient supply” and “temporary authorization for use.” In the EU, named patient programs also allow patients to access drugs in the time period between centralized European Medicines Agency (EMEA) approval and launch in their home countries which can range from one year to eighteen months.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle", "body": "The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) (formerly known as the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle) is an amphibious assault vehicle that was being developed for the U.S. Marine Corps. It is launched at sea, from an amphibious assault ship beyond the horizon, able to transport a full Marine rifle squad to shore. It would maneuver cross country with an agility and mobility equal to or greater than the M1 Abrams.\\n\\nThe EFV was designed to replace the aging AAV-7A1 Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV), which entered service in 1972, and was the Marine Corps' number one priority ground weapon system acquisition. It has three times the speed in water and about twice the armor of the AAV, as well as superior fire power. The vehicle was planned to be deployed in 2015; however, on 6 January 2011, SECDEF Robert Gates announced that he recommends the EFV program be canceled. The total program cost thus far has been $3 billion. If the EFV is canceled it would be superseded by the New Amphibious Vehicle program.\\n\\nIn the 1980s the Marine corps developed an \"over the horizon\" strategy for ocean based assaults. The intention was to protect naval ships from enemy mine and shore defenses. It included the MV-22 Osprey, the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), and the EFV.\\n\\nDevelopment for the AAAV began on the late 1970s with prototypes in the early 1980s at the command at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The AAAV's predecessor, the LVTP7, had its life expectancy extended in 1983-84 by use of a service life extension program, which modified and upgraded many of the key systems, creating the LVTP7A1 and re-designated it the AAVP7A1. At the time these vehicles were released, the USMC had anticipated and communicated delivery of the AAAV by 1993. As a result of delays, the AAVP7A1 has received another service life extension-type upgrade in the mid 1990s while the USMC still awaits final development and delivery of the AAAV, 14 years behind original projected time frames.\\n\\nIn 1988, defense officials authorized the concept exploration and definition phase. In 1995, the program entered into the definition and risk reduction phase, where it won two DOD awards for successful cost and technology management. In June 1996, a contract was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems to begin full-scale engineering development of their design. Based on the aforementioned early success of the program, the Marine Corps awarded a cost-plus contract to General Dynamics in July 2001 for the systems development and demonstration phase of the program, expected to be completed by October 2003. The AAAV was renamed to EFV in September 2003. The Government Accountability Office would later state that the development phase of three years was insufficient, causing delays and prototype failures, particularly in reliability. After the 2006 Operational Assessment was plagued by reliability issues and maintenance burdens, the Corps began a redesign of the EFV, requiring a new contract for an additional  in February 2007. That June, a reset of the development phase delayed completion an additional four years. Instead of initiating production as planned, the Corps asked for seven new prototypes, to address the current deficiencies, which have caused an average of one failure for every four and a half hours of operation.\\n\\nOn 7 April 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that the EFV program will \"continue as-is\", pending an amphibious review in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The vehicle has recently been called \"exquisite\", which Gates has usually reserved for programs he intends to cancel. He later questioned the EFV as the proper ship-to-shore platform on 3 May 2010, the day before the initial prototype was rolled out at a ceremony at Marine Corps Base Quantico.\\n\\nThe USMC has reduced the number to be purchased from 1,013 to 573 AAAVs by 2015 due to escalation in unit cost estimated at $22.3 million dollars in 2007. The EFV might be a baseline vehicle for the Army's BCT Ground Combat Vehicle Program, however it is more likely that the Army will start a new program.\\n\\nLow rate initial production (LRIP) is projected to begin in January 2012. Projected total program development cost of the type until first quarter of 2010 has been estimated at 15.9 billion dollars.\\n\\nRobert O. Work has sketched out a future for amphibious warfare in which either the Marines will land unopposed or it will take a major effort using all the long range weapons of the United States armed forces to clear out ship killing missiles so that amphibious ships can safely approach the hostile beach and neither scenario sees much use for the EFV.\\n\\nIn a joint report the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the National Taxpayers Union called the EFV program wasteful spending and asked for its cancellation. The co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform have also supported the cancellation of the EFV. During a Pentagon briefing, on 6 January 2011, revealing budget efficiencies and reinvestment possibilities, SECDEF Gates announced his intention to cancel the EFV program. In a statement released after Gates' press conference, CMC Amos said that he supports the cancellation of the EFV: \\n\\nLoren B. Thompson, of the Lexington Institute, said that Amos had been ordered to give this statement, which did not reflect his actual feelings on the issue.\\n\\nIn an interview on 5 January 2011 with Bloomberg Businessweek, Duncan D. Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, anticipated the cancellation announcement by Gates. However, Hunter has predicted that his committee will reject the cancellation.\\n\\nAccording to Lieutenant General George J. Flynn of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, the USMC will use funding from the cancelled EFV for other tactical ground vehicles over the next five years. \\n\\nthumbThe EFV, designed by General Dynamics Land Systems, is an amphibious armored tracked vehicle with an aluminum hull. The engine is a custom MTU Friedrichshafen diesel (MT883) with two modes of operation; a high power mode for planing over the sea, and a low power mode for land travel. It has a crew of three and can transport 17 Marines and their equipment. The EFV is the first heavy tactical vehicle with a space frame structure.\\n\\nThe hull has a hydraulically actuated bow flap to aid planing with a maximum waterborne speed of . Shrouded Honeywell waterjet propulsor are integrated into each side of the hull, which create over 2,800 horsepower. It is also outfitted with hydraulically actuated chine to cover the tracks while in seafaring mode. The rear loading ramp is not able to open while the vehicle is afloat, typical of other swimming military ground vehicles.\\n\\nThe vehicle uses an Ethernet network connected by the Tactical Switch Router, based on the COTS DuraMAR Mobile IP router for its internal and external communications.\\n\\nThe electronically powered two-man MK46 turret on the personnel variant accommodates the commander on the right and gunner on the left, a fire control system, and the main and coaxial weapons.\\n\\nThe standard version has a Mk44 Bushmaster II 30 mm cannon, which fires up to 250 rounds per minute with single, burst, and fully automatic capabilities up to  in all weather conditions. A general purpose M240 7.62&nbsp;mm machine gun with 600 rounds of ready-to-use ammunition is mounted coaxially with the main gun.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIt is fitted with composite armor, mine-blast protection, and a nuclear, biological and chemical defense system. The aluminum hull has caused some concern due to protection issues. However, aluminum hulls have been used for decades in military ground vehicles and watercraft.\\n\\nIn June 2007 members of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces sent a letter to the Commandant of the Marine Corps urging that the EFV be redesigned to give troops better protection against roadside bombs. The Marines have suggested that underbelly armor appliqué could be applied after the EFVs come ashore and before they encounter IEDs. The limited protection the EFV offers is an improvement on that offered by the AAV so the replacement is an advantage, given the current doctrine of using landing craft for land patrols.\\n\\nHowever, tests in January and February 2010 at Aberdeen Test Center demonstrated that the EFV offers blast protection equal to a category-2 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, including two simulated improvised explosive device under its belly and tracks. Tests also show that it has superior protection from direct and indirect fire. The flat hull, which has endured persistent criticism for not being the more blast-resistant V-shape, is necessary for the EFV to plane across the surface of the water and reach its high speed, while dealing with sea state of Category 4.\\n\\nOn 13 October 2010 the Navy awarded M Cubed Technologies a contract to develop new armor for the EFV to offer better protection and lighter weight.\\n\\nGiven the increasing ranges of shore launched anti-ship missile, the EFV's  range for amphibious landing may no longer provide the anticipated protection predicted for an over the horizon launch. The U.S. Navy has been reconsidering the over the horizon approach, and is considering 10-18 miles appropriate for amphibious launches. This shift in doctrine has made the EFV's high water speeds less necessary. The EFV's need for high water speed has resulted in an engine that is 1,200 hp more powerful than the M1 Abrams, even though the EFV weighs far less.\\n\\nThe EFVP1 with a 3-man crew will conduct the signature mission of the United States Marine Corps, expeditionary maneuver warfare from seabases by initiating amphibious operations from 20–25 miles over-the-horizon and transporting 17 combat-equipped Marines to inland objectives. The fully armored, tracked combat vehicle will provide lethal firepower to disembarked or mechanized infantry with its own fully stabilized MK46 weapon station with the 30 mm cannon and 7.62mm machine-gun.\\n\\nthumbThe EFVC1 provides the same survival and mobility capabilities found in the EFVP1. The EFVC1 will be employed as a tactical command post for maneuver unit commanders at the battalion and regiment level. The EFVC1 will provide the supported commander and selected staff with the ability to communicate, via on-board communications, with senior, adjacent, and subordinate maneuver units. The EFVC1 is armed with only a 7.62mm machine gun.\\n\\n"}

Sodium chlorate is a strong oxidizing agent, and reacted with the organic fibres (i.e. the wool and the cotton) of the clothes. Reports had farmers' trousers variously smoldering and bursting into flame, particularly when exposed to heat or naked flames. One report had trousers that were hanging on a washing line starting to smoke. There were also several reports of trousers exploding while farmers were wearing them, causing severe burns.\\n\\nThe history was written up by James Watson of Massey University in a widely reported article, \"The Significance of Mr. Richard Buckley's Exploding Trousers\", and which later won him an Ig Nobel Prize\\n\\nIn their May 2006 \"Exploding Pants\" episode the popular U.S. television show MythBusters investigated the idea that trousers could explode based on the events of New Zealand in the 1930s.Experimenters tested four substances on 100% cotton overalls:\\n\\nEach of these were put to four different ignition methods: Flame, radiant heat, Friction and impact. Although not naming \"the herbicide\" as sodium chlorate, they confirmed that trousers would indeed vigorously combust due to flame, radiant heat and impact, though their friction tests did not cause ignition. However, combustion is not the same as an explosion, which requires compression and a detonation. Even so, a person witnessing such an event (especially if he or she were wearing the trousers) would likely describe the event as an explosion. \\n\\nThe tests also revealed that none of the other three substances caused combustion of the trousers, thus indicating that sodium chlorate was almost certainly responsible for the events that occurred.\\n\\nABC's The Science Show described exploding trousers as \"the scenario for a Goon Show\", and, in an example of art imitating life, it actually was. The Goons wrote a script about a chemical which \"when applied to the tail of a military soldier shirt, is tasteless, colourless, and odourless\" but that \"The moment the wearer sits down, the heat from his body causes the chemical to explode.\".\\n\\nIn the final episode of Blackadder Goes Forth, Captain Edmund Blackadder says that he's \"Off to Hartlepool to buy a pair of exploding trousers\" when feigning madness to avoid going over the top.\\n\\nTrousers\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Extropianism", "body": "Extropianism, also referred to as the philosophy of \"Extropy\", is an evolving framework of values and standards for continuously improving the human condition. Extropians believe that advances in science and technology will some day let people live indefinitely. An extropian may wish to contribute to this goal, e.g. by doing research and development or volunteering to test new technology.\\n\\nExtropianism describes a pragmatic consilience of transhumanist thought guided by a proactionary approach to human evolution and progress. \\n\\nOriginated by a set of principles developed by Dr. Max More, The Principles of Extropy, extropian thinking places strong emphasis on rational thinking and practical optimism. According to More, these principles \"do not specify particular beliefs, technologies, or policies\". Extropians share an optimistic view of the future, expecting considerable advances in computational power, life extension, nanotechnology and the like. Many extropians foresee the eventual realization of unlimited maximum life span, and the recovery, thanks to future advances in biomedical technology, of those whose bodies/brains have been preserved by means of cryonics.\\n\\nExtropy, as coined by Tom Bell (T.O. Morrow) and defined by Max More in 1988, is \"the extent of a living or organizational system's intelligence, functional order, vitality, energy, life, experience, and capacity and drive for improvement and growth.\" Extropy is not a rigorously defined technical term in philosophy or science; in a metaphor sense, it simply expresses the opposite of entropy.\\n\\nIn the philosophy of digital probabilistic physics, the extropy of a physical system is defined to be the self-information of the Markov chain probability of the physical system at a moment in time. This was to distinguish the probability of the Markov state of the physical system from the probability defined by entropy which creates ensembles of equivalent microstates. \\n\\nIn 1987, Max More moved to Los Angeles from Oxford University in England, where he had helped to establish (along with Michael Price, Garret Smyth and Luigi Warren) the first European cryonics organization, known as Mizar Limited (later Alcor UK), to work on his Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Southern California.\\n\\nIn 1988, Extropy: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought was first published. This brought together thinkers with interests in artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, life extension, mind uploading, idea futures, robotics, space exploration, memetics, and the politics and economics of transhumanism. Alternative media organizations soon began reviewing the magazine, and it attracted interest from likeminded thinkers. Later, More and Bell co-founded the Extropy Institute, a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational organization. \"ExI\" was formed as a transhumanist networking and information center to use current scientific understanding along with critical and creative thinking to define a small set of principles or values that could help make sense of new capabilities opening up to humanity.\\n\\nThe Extropy Institute's email list was launched in 1991 (and, as of August 2009, continues to exist as \"Extropy-Chat\"), and in 1992 the institute began producing the first conferences on transhumanism. Affiliate members throughout the world began organizing their own transhumanist groups. Extro Conferences, meetings, parties, on-line debates, and documentaries continue to spread transhumanism to the public. \\n\\nThe Internet soon became the most fertile breeding ground for people interested in exploring transhumanist ideas, with the availability of websites for such organizations that have joined the Extropy Institute in developing and advocating transhumanist (and related) ideas. These include Humanity+, the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, the Life Extension Foundation, Foresight Institute, Transhumanist Arts &amp; Culture, The Extropist Examiner, the Immortality Institute, Betterhumans, Aleph in Sweden, the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies.\\n\\nIn 2006 the board of directors of the Extropy Institute made a decision to close the organisation, stating that its mission was \"essentially completed.\"\\n\\nExtropism is a modern derivative of the transhumanist philosophy of Extropianism. It follows in the same tradition, hence the similarity of name, but has been revised to better suit the paradigms of the 21st century. As introduced in The Extropist Manifesto, it promotes an optimistic futurist philosophy that can be summed up in the following five phrases, which spell out the word \"EXTROPISM\":\\n\\nThese five key points, when taken together, formulate a philosophy and world view which embraces bio-ethical abolitionism, life extension, singularitarianism, technogaianism, freedom of information and several other related disciplines and philosophies. While it does not make a firm political stance, it is most closely related to libertarianism. Philosophically, it draws from the philosophy of Jeremy Bentham and utilitarianism.\\n\\nExtropists desire to prolong their life span to a near-immortal state and exist in a world where artificial intelligence and robotics have made work irrelevant. As in utilitarianism, the purpose of one's life should be to increase the overall happiness of all creatures on Earth through cooperation.\\n\\nThe Extropist Manifesto, written by Breki Tomasson and Hank Hyena of The Extropist Examiner in January 2010, details the ways in which Extropism has evolved away from, while building upon the original tenets of Extropianism. For example, it moves away from the original Extropian Principles  by placing a significant focus on the need to abolish and/or restrict the current use of surveillance, copyright and patent laws. This philosophy, inspired in part by the philosophy of the International Pirate Party, is one of the five basic tenets of the Extropist philosophy, falling under the category \"Overcoming Property\". Other noteworthy topics that appear frequently in Extropist writings is the focus on equal rights for LGBT couples and individuals and a general distaste for religiosity.\\n\\n*\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eye chart", "body": "An eye chart is a chart used to measure visual acuity. Types of eye charts include the Snellen chart, Landolt C, and the Lea test.\\n\\nCharts usually display several rows of optotype (test symbols), each row in a different size. The person is asked to identify the numbers or letters on the chart, usually starting with large rows and continuing to smaller rows until the optotypes cannot be reliably identified anymore.\\n\\nTechnically speaking, testing visual acuity with an eye chart is a psychophysical measurement that attempts to determine a sensory threshold (see also psychometric function).\\n\\nCharts are available for very young children or illiterate adults that do not require letter recognition. One version uses simple pictures or patterns. Others are printed with the block letter \"E\" turned in different orientations, the so called Tumbling E. The patient simply indicates which direction each \"E\" is facing. The Landolt C chart is similar: rows have circles with different segments missing, and the test-taker describes where each broken piece is located. The last two kinds of charts also reduce the possibility of the patient guessing the images.\\n\\nComputer-based semi-automatic alternatives to the eye chart have been developed, but are not very common. They have several potential advantages, such as a more precise measurement and less examiner-induced bias. Some of them are also well suited for children since they resemble a video game.\\n\\nWhile visual acuity charts are usually designed for use at 6 metres or 20 feet, there is often also a need to test a subject's vision at near or occupational tasks (like reading or computer use). For these situations near-point charts have been created.\\n\\n"}

Kretchmer, it first aired in the United States on January 23, 1995.\\n\\nHercules agrees to aid a town terrorized by a cyclops, but soon learns that the creature's actions may not be entirely unjustified.\\n\\nHercules is running along a beach trying to get away from a large group of young women. Later in a tavern a man asks Hercules about the women, and he tells him that they are the 50 daughters of the king Thespius. Another man comes over to Hercules' table and asks him what he is going to do about the cyclops which is terrorising Trachis. The cyclops had been chasing people out of their homes to protect Hera's sacred vineyard. Hercules sets off to deal with the cyclops. Elsewhere a man is walking along the road and meets the cyclops. The cyclops picks up the man and kicks him away. Hercules walking through the trees sees the man hanging from a branch. The man introduces himself as Salmoneus, a toga salesman. He decides that he will travel with Hercules.\\n\\nAt the riverside three men are attempting to move a rock which had been placed there to divert the river away from their homes and to Hera's vineyard. The cyclops comes and threatens them, one man runs, another stands up to the cyclops and gets smashed into the ground by the cyclops' huge fist, the third man then also runs back to the village. The men who fled from the cyclops tell Hercules that one of their men has just been killed by the cyclops. The villagers throw a party to celebrate that Hercules will rid them of the cyclops. At the party the 50 daughters of Thespius come looking for Hercules, Salmoneus lies and tells them he went to Athens. The following day a young woman, Scilla, is picking flowers when the cyclops approaches and she runs away frightened. She arrives back at the village and tells the others what happened, Hercules goes looking for the cyclops.\\n\\nWhile searching for the cyclops, Hercules is faced with the daughters again, but manages to evade them. He meets with the cyclops and after a brief fight, Hercules realises that the cyclops is not evil, he'd just been hurt in the past by the villagers calling him nasty names. He tells the cyclops that he should work with the villagers and not for Hera. He tells Hercules he works for Castor, who is in charge of the vineyard, not Hera. Hercules convinces the cyclops that he should try to resolve his problems with the villagers. Her then goes back to the village and tells the people there that they should give the cyclops some respect and not call him names and treat him like a freak. One man, Atreus, says he won't be nice and some villagers agree, Scilla tells them they are awful for being so mean to the cyclops.\\n\\nMeanwhile a group of Hera's executioners come looking for Hercules. As Hercules helps the villagers divert the river back to their village, the cyclops comes to help, some people throw rocks at him and call him names, as he retreats, Scilla follows him. Hercules says he know why the cyclops is evil, it wasn't Hera that made him evil, it was the people of the village by always calling him names. At his cave Scilla tries to convince the cyclops that not all the villagers feel the same, he replies that she still fled out of fear when she first saw him. The cyclops offers his help to Hercules and they both fight Hera's men. Some of the villagers say they should help. Atreus says he \"I won't die helping a freak, or anyone who side with one, even if it is Hercules.\" After disposing of all of Hera's men. Atreus asks Hercules how he can repay him, Hercules says that they should just \"be nice\" to the cyclops. The villagers and the cyclops agree to let each other live in peace. As Hercules and Salmoneus leave the village they are encountered by the 50 daughters again, they say they don't want Hercules and that Salmoneus will do. Salmoneus walks off with the women, leaving Hercules to travel alone to his next adventure.\\n\\n"}

Eyvind also had a brother named Olvir Hnufa, who became a famous skald at the court of King Harald I of Norway.\\n\\nLike his brother Olvir, Eyvind joined his nephew Thorolf Kveldulfsson on a number of viking expeditions after the latter received a longship as a gift from his father Kveldulf. They gained a great deal of profit from such voyages. At a thing in Gaular, Olvir fell in love with Solveig Atladottir, the daughter of a jarl in Fjordane named Atli the Slender. The jarl refused Olvir permission to marry the girl, but he was so smitten that he abandoned his viking life to be near her. Eyvind continued to voyage with Thorolf for some time thereafter.\\n\\nthumbTogether with Thorolf, Eyvind made his way to the court of King Harald of Vestfold, who was in the process of conquering the Norwegian kingdoms and uniting Norway under his rule. His brother Olvir had already joined the court as a skald. However, after swearing allegiance to King Harald, Eyvind returned home with his father Kari. With Olvir and Thorolf, Eyvind fought at the Battle of Hafrsfjord (c. 872/885) aboard Harald's flagship. Eyvind is thereafter not mentioned until the death of Thorolf at the hands of King Harald (c. 900), at which time he administered to those wounded in the battle. Eyvind assisted Thorolf's widow Sigrid in administering her estates. He subsequently married Sigrid on King Harald's orders. Egil's Saga relates that Eyvind and Harald \"remained friends for the rest of their lives.\"\\n\\nWith Sigrid Eyvind had two children mentioned in Egil's Saga: Finn Eyvindsson \"the Squinter\" and Geirlaug Eyvindsdottir. Finn married Gunnhild, daughter of a jarl named Halfdan and maternal granddaughter of King Harald. Their children included Eyvind the Plagiarist, court skald to Haakon the Good.

{"title": "FAO Country Profiles", "body": "The FAO Country Profiles is a multilingual web portal which repackages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) vast archive of information on its global activities in agriculture and food security in a single area and catalogues it exclusively by country and thematic areas.\\n\\nThe portal's purpose is to offer decision-makers, researchers and project formulators around the world a fast and reliable way to access country-specific information on national food security situations without the need to search individual databases and systems. It gives added-value to FAO's wealth of information by providing an easy-to-use interface containing interactive maps and charts.\\n\\nFAO has always highlighted information and Knowledge sharing as priority areas in fighting hunger and achieving food security. In this context, FAO identified that countries could improve their national programmes on agriculture and food security if they could access FAO's information through a cross-sectoral (or interdisciplinary) country-based approach. However, despite the existence of a large number of country-based information systems in FAO, the information managed by the various systems lacked integration. Information tended to be generated and used in a circumscribed manner and tailored to a specific system, department or sector.\\n\\nThe FAO Country Profiles portal, initially called FAO Country Profiles and Mapping Information System, was launched in 2002 responding to the Organization’s need to provide FAO web site’s users an easy to use mechanism to find FAO country-specific information without the need to search individual FAO web sites, databases or systems. The system was designed to integrate analytical and multilingual information with thematic databases and digital map repositories and to facilitate access to information on multiple factors contributing to national food insecurity. \\n\\nSince its launch, the system has grown by incorporating more and more data sources. This was achieved thanks to a corporate effort to reduce information silo and the adoption of international standards for country-based information management throughout the Organization.\\n\\nThe methodology behind the FAO Country Profiles is rather simple; it links, reuses and repackages data and information from most relevant existing FAO databases and systems. \\n\\nThe FAO Country Profiles covers current FAO Members and Associated Nations. Once a country is selected, the portal presents to the user documents, news feeds, statistical data, project details and maps from relevant FAO databases and systems for the selected country and categorized according to thematic areas. \\n\\nThe thematic areas are grouped in two categories: \\n\\nCountry pages provide access to or integrate the following thematic profiles and systems.\\n\\nThere are various international standards and coding systems to manage country information. Historically, systems dealing with different types of data used different coding systems that were tailored to specific data type requirements. For example, statistical systems in the United Nations commonly use the M-49 classification (also known as UN code) or the FAOSTAT area classification; mapping systems could use geographic coordinates or GAUL codes; textual systems (document repositories or web sites) could use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 or AGROVOC keywords; etc.\\n\\nThe FAO Country Profiles provide access to systems managing statistics, documents, maps, news feeds, etc., therefore one of its key aspects to succeed was the mapping of all these country codes. \\n\\nFor this purpose a geopolitical ontology was developed. This ontology, among other features, maps ISO2, ISO3, AGROVOC, FAOSTAT, FAOTERM, GAUL, UN, and UNDP codes for all countries.\\n\\nBesides the profiles for each country the portal also provides access to other important global resources, such as:\\n\\nThe FAO Country Profiles keeps updated for the public the list of LIFDC countries. This list is revised every year according to the methodology explained below. The list of the LIFDC, as of May 2009, stands at 77 countries, five less than those in the 2008 LIFDC list. These five are: Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cape Verde and Tonga. All five graduated from the list having completed the \"transitional phase\", exceeding the World Bank income threshold for three consecutive years.\\n\\nThe classification of a country as low-income food-deficit used for analytical purposes by FAO is traditionally determined by three criteria:\\n\\nIn order to avoid countries changing their LIFDC status too frequently - typically due to short-term, exogenous shocks - an additional factor was introduced in 2001. This factor, called \"persistence of position\", would postpone the \"exit\" of a LIFDC from the list, despite the country not meeting the LIFDC income criterion or the food-deficit criterion, until the change in its status is verified for three consecutive years.\\n\\nThe FAO Country Profiles is FAO's source for dissemination of FAO's Member Nations and Associated Nations official flags. The update of any country flag is coordinated with the other United Nations agencies. All flags are made available in an standardized manner which also aims to help web site owners to ensure that they always display the official country flag. \\n\\nThe standard URL for any given country flag would be composed by: the generic URL: \"http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/flags/\" to which the ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code for the country is added, plus the image format suffix \".gif\". For instance, the URL for the Argentina flag would be: http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/flags/AR.gif, with AR being the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Argentina.\\n\\nEarly criticism of the FAO Country Profiles was that, in its inception phase, it only contained very few resources. Since 2002, the number of available resources has increased to cover country-based information and data, directly linked from FAO's web pages or FAO's digital repositories. Over the last years, another identified area for improvement was the simplicity of the system methodology, being the resources only linked from country pages and thus, lacking real integration. This need was addressed by starting to integrate additional data, such as, the fisheries charts or the news and events items taken from AgriFeeds. In addition, in order to provide more complete country profiles, the system started to link or integrate non-FAO resources.\\n\\n"}

Despite this, it has never won today's Russian Premier League title.\\n\\nDuring the Soviet era it was affiliated with the MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs - The Soviet Militia & the KGB) and was a part of Dynamo sports society. On 10 April 2009, VTB Bank acquired 74% of the stock in the club. The club was founded in 1923 by Felix Dzerzhinsky.\\n\\nrightDynamo Moscow has its roots in the club Morozovtsi Orekhovo-Zuevo Moskva founded as a factory team in 1887. The team was re-named OKS Moskva in 1906 and won a series of Moscow league championships from 1910 to 1914. \\n\\nAfter the Russian revolution of 1917 the club eventually found itself under the authority of the Interior Ministry and its head Felix Dzerzhinsky, chief of the Soviet Union's first secret police force, the notorious Cheka. The club was re-named Dinamo Moskva in 1923 and developed some infamy for its intimidating association with the Interior Ministry, often being referred to as Garbage, a Russian criminal slang term for police, by the supporters of other clubs.leftDinamo won the first two Soviet Championships in 1936 and 1937, a Soviet Cup in 1937, and another pair of national titles in 1940 and 1945. They were also the first Soviet club to tour the West and put on an impressive display during a goodwill visit to the United Kingdom in 1945. Complete unknowns, the Soviet players delivered a surprising performance: they drew 3:3 at Chelsea, rode roughshod 10:1 over Cardiff City, beat an Arsenal side reinforced by the presence of Stanley Matthews, Stan Mortensen and Joe Bacuzzi by a score of 4:3 in a match played in thick fog, and finally, drew 2:2 with Rangers.\\n\\nThey continued to be a strong side at home after the war and enjoyed their greatest success through the 50's. Dinamo captured another five championships between 1949 and 1959, as well as their second Soviet Cup in 1953. Honours were harder to come by after that time. The club continued to enjoy some success in the Soviet Cup, but has not won a national championship since 1976. Even so, Dinamo's 11 national titles make it the country's third most decorated side behind Dynamo Kiev (13 titles) and Spartak Moscow (12 titles).\\n\\nDynamo's greatest achievement in Europe to this day was in the 1972 UEFA Cup Winners Cup. They got to the final at the Nou Camp in Barcelona where they lost to Scottish side Rangers 3-2. This was a Russian side's greatest achievement in Europe until CSKA Moscow won the 2005 UEFA Cup. At the end of the 2008 season of the Russian Premier League Dynamo finished the season in 3rd position, therefore gaining access to the 3rd qualification round for non-champions of the 2009/10 edition of the UEFA Champions League. This was the first time that the club had taken part in the competition since its re-branding from the European Cup in 1992. On 29 July 2009, Moscow beat Celtic 1-0 at Celtic Park which gave them a strong advantage going into the second leg. However, Celtic comfortably defeated Dynamo 2-0 in Moscow to progress and send them crashing into the Europa League play-off round, where Dinamo were eliminated by CSKA Sofia after 0-0 draw in Sofia and 1-2 loss in Moscow.\\n\\nTheir ground is the historic Dinamo Stadium in Petrovsky Park, which seats 36,540. Despite not having won a league title in over thirty years the club still has a quite extensive, though aging, fan base.\\n\\nAs of September 10, 2010, according to the Russian Professional Football League website\\n\\nFor recent transfers, see List of Russian football transfers summer 2010 and List of Russian football transfers winter 2009–10.\\n\\nThe following players are registered with the RFPL and are listed by club's website as reserve players. They are eligible to play for the first team.\\n\\nDynamo's reserve squad played professionally as FC Dynamo-d Moscow (Russian Second League in 1992-1993, Russian Third League in 1994-1997) and FC Dynamo-2 Moscow (Russian Second Division in 1998-2000).

The Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, was considered a business and a fraud by FUDOFSI. Conversely, FUDOSFI was considered a business and a fraud by FUDOSI.\\n\\nThe first meeting of FUDOFSI took place in Paris, France, in February 1939.\\n\\nList of people present in the first meeting of FUDOFSI:\\n\\nHans Rudolf Hilfiker-Dunn and Arnoldo Krumm-Heller joined FUDOFSI later.\\n\\nFUDOFSI ceased to exist at some point during World War II. However, in 1947 some of its members contacted each other and tried to establish a new organisation. Hans-Rudolf Hilfiker and R. Swinburne Clymer (1878–1966) tried to create a Worldwide Alliance of Rosicrucian Orders. In Rio de Janeiro, Clymer successfully merged his organisation with Krumm-Heller's. Hilfiker and Clymer had a meeting on May 7, 1947 and also on June 5, 1948, in Zürich (Switzerland) at the hotel Baur-au-lac. The Fraternitas Rosae Crucis official biography of Emerson Myron Clymer, son of R. S. Clymer, describes him as Supreme Grand Master of FUDOFSI after his father's death, so it is possible that the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis considers FUDOFSI to have survived later.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "FXdirekt Bank", "body": "The FXdirekt Bank is an independent company with around 90 employees. The company headquarters are located in Krefeld, Germany and the branch office is located in Oberhausen. The FXdirekt Bank is a member of the EdW (\"Entschädigungseinrichtung der Wertpapierhandelsunternehmen\"), which is an organisation created to secure investor claims and is also registered as a commercial bank with the BaFin the German financial regulator.\\n\\nThe first German-language online trading platform FXdirekt was introduced onto the market in 2001 by the company ibas AG, which was closely associated with the FXdirekt Bank. The FXdirekt Bank was founded in 2004 and has steadily broadened its areas of competence in the forex market. The multimarket trading platform FEXtrader Pro was introduced in 2007. The bank now offers not only online trading with forex, stocks, indices, commodities and treasuries but also the complete technological settlement of the FX, CFD and FFD transactions.The CEO of FXdirekt is Mr.Wolfgang Stobbe, born on 21 May 1963. He holds 100% of all shares of the FXdirekt Bank AG. He is also the owner of 5 companies at the same location as FXdirekt Bank in Oberhausen. \\n\\nCurrencies or foreign exchange are traded on the foreign exchange (forex) market. The forex market functions decentrally and is therefore not bound to any particular stock exchange. A foreign currency transaction involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of two currencies. This leads to the formation of the rate of exchange. As with any other market, the price of the currency is determined by supply and demand. Worldwide a volume of 2,000 billion US-Dollars is traded each day. The FXdirekt Bank AG offers up to 200 currency pairs. As well as the major currency pairs such as EUR/USD the FEXtrader Pro trading platform allows clients to trade numerous exotics.\\n\\nA contract for difference (CFD) is an agreement to exchange the difference between the opening and closing price of a position and is a type of derivative financial instrument. Unlike trading shares, trading CFDs does not involve the purchase of an actual share in the company. CFD trading allows the investor to participate in the price movement for the given underlying, without having to physically own it. The price development for CFDs is therefore based on the prices of other financial products, such as shares. A significant advantage when trading CFDs is that the investor can not only trade on rising prices by going long, but can also trade on falling prices by going short. CFD trading also requires a lower amount of investment capital than share trading. The margin requirement is usually only a low percentage of the total value of the transaction, this creates the so-called leverage effect.\\n\\nFFDs (Futures for Difference) are also contracts for difference but are based on commodities, indices and bonds. Trading FFDs is similar to trading CFDs, however the price development of an FFD is based on standardized futures contracts, whereby the settlement date and the contract size are standardized. FFDs were developed by the FXdirekt Bank and are a registered trademark.\\n\\nThe FXdirekt Bank was voted Best Forex Broker in the German “Brokerwahl” broker awards in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. In 2008 FXdirekt Bank also came third in the CFD Broker category in the Broker Awards. The broker awards are an independent poll of thousands of private investors who evaluate the services provided by numerous banks and brokers from a range of different segments.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fable (Characters)", "body": "Fable is a video game that was published by Lionhead Studios in 2004, on Xbox, PC and MAC platforms. The original game has had 3 sequels. Fable II, which takes place 500 years after the original, Fable III that take place 50 years after Fable II and Fable: The Lost Chapters which fills in the gap between Fable and Fable II. It was notable for its use of characters, and customization of the player character based on his actions during the game.Characters in Fable are split up into two categories. The heroes are born of a special bloodline, possessing special abilities above those in the other category, the normal citizens of Albion.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe Hero of Oakvale is the main protagonist of the game, being the player character throughout the game. \\n\\nThe player first meets him in his childhood years before the beginning of the main storyline, where the Hero is trying to find enough money to buy his sister, Theresa, a birthday present.\\n\\nThe hero is the child of the heroine Scarlet Robe and continues the ancient bloodline of the rulers of The Old Kingdom, the Archon. Due to this he is the most powerful Hero in the game and is a master of three Hero traits strength, skill and will. \\n\\nHis journey is mostly controlled by the player. At key points in the game, scenes (often narrated by the Guildmaster) inform the player of their impact on the world of Albion. These occur at points such as the defeat of Jack of Blades, where the Hero has a choice to either take Jack's sword and kill his sister, Theresa, or destroy the sword. The story of the original fable ends at this point, though it continues in Fable: The Lost Chapters.\\n\\nScarlet Robe is the mother of the game's protagonist, The Hero of Oakvale. She is recognised as once being a powerful hero and well known for slaying Balverines. She married the Hero Of Oakvale's father,Brom, after he took her in when she was injured in a battle with Balverines. The couple brought up the Hero of Oakvale and his sister, Theresa in peace until they were tracked down and attacked by Jack of Blades who recognised them as descendants of Archon and the first step in finding The Sword of Aeons. \\n\\nDuring the attack on Oakvale Scarlet was captured, interrogated and held in Bargate prison until she was freed by her son sometime later. Scarlet's freedom did not last long as she was recaptured by Jack. Eventually the Hero of Oakvale rescued her again and she began her quest to find her daughter Theresa. Unfortunately Jack eventually caught up with Scarlet and he sacrificed her to acquire the Sword of Aeons.\\n\\nTheresa is the daughter of Brom and Scarlet Robe and as such is also the older sister of The Hero of Oakvale. She was raised in Oakvale, unaware that she was indeed a hero with powers of foresight. She was captured during the raid of Oakvale by the Jack of Blades' forces. She refuses to give them any of the information they demand and so she is left for dead in the forest after having her eyes cut out. She was then found by the Bandit King, Twinblade, and he raised her to fully harness her prophetic powers.\\n\\nWhen the Hero of Oakvale came to Twinblades Camp in order to find the \"Bandit Seeress\", he was shocked to discover that it was in fact Theresa. After the defeat of her master, Theresa leaves the Hero regardless of his choice, with a cryptic warning that he will one day have to make a choice that will affect all of Albion.\\n\\nAs the game progresses, Theresa continues to guide the hero, often having a far greater insight and understanding of the current events than the Hero, due to her power of foresight. It is Theresa who suggests that Scarlet Robe is still alive and in Bargate Prison. Theresa is also very good at avoiding the attentions of Jack of Blades, evading him for a long time before the Hero gives her position away by visiting her while holding an enchanted seal given to him by Jack.\\n\\nDuring the events surrounding the death of Maze, Theresa has been captured and is being used to summon the \"Septimal Key\". Maze attempts to convince the Hero it is Theresa, rather than him, who has been corrupted by Jack, but he is quickly exposed after the Hero has been captured as well. Before the Hero can be transported to the Guild to take part in Jack's ritual, however, Theresa uses the last of her Will power to free him, allowing him to do battle with Maze.\\n\\nThe final time Theresa appears in the story comes after the battle with Jack of Blades in the Heroes Guild, when she presents the Hero with the options to either kill her and take Jack's sword, becoming more powerful than even Jack had, or to destroy the sword forever.\\n\\nRegardless of the player's actions, Theresa will appear in Fable II as the guide for the Hero of Bowerstone, meaning that the canon ending for the original Fable is the destruction of the Sword of Aeons. In Fable II, Theresa seems to still be alive, much the same as Scythe, so it is possible that descendents of the Archon have very long lifespans, or that Theresa found the same method of cheating death as Scythe, though this is mostly fan theory.\\n\\nWeaver also know as the Guildmaster is the leader of the Heroes' Guild during most of the original Fable. After he was brought to the Heroes' Guild by Maze, it was Weaver who taught the Hero of Oakvale in his younger years, training him to fight and in the ways of the Heroes. He also in this time trained Whisper, and often trained the two young apprentices together, sometimes pitting them against each other as well, acting as a father figure to the Hero of Oakvale. \\n\\nAfter the Hero's graduation, he became more of a guide and advisor during the main quest, mentoring him in being a Hero and acted as an advisor to The Hero of Oakvale during his quests to find his mother, Scarlet Robe and his attempts to destroy Jack of Blades.\\n\\nJack of Blades is the main adversary of The Hero of Oakvale in Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters. He is able to use his mask to take over bodies of hosts and live forever through them. Just like the Hero is is a master of strength, skill and will. Jack of Blades has never been seen in the games without his mask or in his original body.\\n\\nThe story of Jack of Blades in revealed in a book, The Tales of Albion. The book tells of Jack's arrival in Albion from a place called the void. According to the story, he did not come alone instead he came with the Queen of Blades and the Knight of Blades\\n\\nWhisper is the younger sister of hero Thunder. The siblings were shipwrecked and thus left stranded in Albion and were consequently raised by the Heroes' Guild. She relies on her agility in combat and also uses bombs against groups of enemies. She has a strong but friendly rivalry with The Hero of Oakvale.\\n\\nThunder is the older brother of hero Whisper. The siblings were shipwrecked and thus left stranded in Albion and were consequently raised by the Heroes' Guild. Thunder is a champion of the arena and managed to complete all of the arena battles without taking a break, a feat rivalled only by Jack of Blades, and then later, The Hero of Oakvale.\\n\\nTwinblade was once a powerful hero until he left the Heroes Guild to unite the Bandit clans and take power over them.Twinblade and the Hero of Oakvale first lock swords when the Hero is told that Twinblade is responsible for the raid on Oakvale that killed his father. However the Hero's sister, Thersea reveals the truth that it was Jack of Blades who began the raid. The final outcome of the battle is dependent on the player but either way Twinblade or his followers will send assassins after The Hero.\\n\\nNostro was a bandit turned hero who is notable for founding the Heroes' Guild. Nostro was a victim to corruption at the hands of a woman named Magdalena and became a target for assassination. As a noble warrior, dying by the hand of an assassin was not the warrior's death he had longed for, and thus wandered Lychfield Graveyard in undead form, until he was laid to rest by The Hero of Oakvale.\\n\\nMaze was a powerful old wizard and leader of the Heroes' Guild. He is defeated in the game by The Hero of Oakvale. Maze's parents were killed by Balverines when he was a child, but he was saved by Jack of Blades and felt endebted to him since. Jack of Blades had Maze lead the group of bandits who raided Oakvale in search of Scarlet Robe and her two children.\\n\\nBriar Rose is a powerful hero stemming from a noble, but tragic, background. When she was a child her mother was killed in an accident she could not prevent, but despite this her father blamed Briar for the death of her mother and cast her out, leaving her to fend for herself. She is notable for her intelligence, and relies more on her intellect than her strength in battle. She plays a vital support role to The Hero of Oakvale throughout the game.\\n\\nBrom was a woodsman in Albion. He nursed his wife to be Scarlet Robe back to health after she was injured in battle. They then married and had two children, The Hero of Oakvale and Theresa. \\n\\nBrom only appears in the childhood section of the game, and gives the Hero his first quest, finding enough Gold coins to pay for a birthday present for Theresa. He is obviously a good man, as he rewards the player for the good deeds around town, such as helping a young boy against a bully, while telling off the player for commiting bad deeds, such as destroying the teddy bear, Rosy.\\n\\nHe is unfortunately killed in the Raid on Oakvale by Jack of Blades and his bandits, being the only family member the Hero actually sees dead at the time, merely assuming the others met a similar fate until he discovers differently later in his quest, when both his mother and sister are found to be still alive.\\n\\nIn Fable, a Bard is a poet that is paid by The Hero of Oakvale to sing songs of their deeds whether those are good or bad.The Bard will sing a song revealing the Heroes success after each quest or title the Hero acquires.\\n\\nLady Eliva Grey is the Mayor of Bowerstone. In her younger years Lady Grey having been persuaded by Jack of Blades murdered her older sister Amanda so that she would inherit the position of mayor. Lady Grey becomes very impressed with the Heroes deeds and becomes infatuated , she even requests that he marrys her after hiring him to find some of her personal possessions.\\n\\nThe Heroes' Guild is a sanctuary for the Heroes situated in Albion. The purpose of the Guild is to train young heroes(Guild Apprentices) in the fields of strength, skill and will before they can venture into the world alone. Withoutout this training Heroes would not be able to protect citizens and continue to keep the world functioning.\\n\\nThe Heroes' Guild was found founded after the fall of the Old Kingdom when the population was divided and the villages were in disrepair. The Guild was founded by an ex-mercenary called Nostro who gathered men and women from throughout Albion. Nostro was aided by a wise old man named Scythe who acted as his tutor and counsel. Nostro enforced peace on the battling people of Albion and for a time it seemed that the peace would last forever.\\n\\nThis is the apparent morality of characters throughout the story. The morality of the Hero of Oakvale is dependent on the way that the game is played and the actions that the player makes.\\n\\n"}

In its coloured history spanning over 135 years it has produced thousands of doctors who have helped contribute to the relatively impressive health statistics in Sri Lanka. Over 1200 students are currently enrolled in the faculty. And the faculty was recognized as an excellent medical faculty all over the world. It produced many excellent doctors for the world.In 1839, the Governor of Ceylon J. A. Stewart Mackenzie started sending Ceylonese students to Calcutta for medical studies to the oldest medical school in South Asia - The Bengal Medical College. \\n\\nIn 1839, the Governor of Ceylon J. A. Stewart Mackenzie started sending Ceylonese students to Calcutta for medical studies to the oldest medical school in South Asia - The Bengal Medical College. In the 1860s the Colonial Surgeon, Dr. James Loos was requested to report on the large depopulation of the Wanni. He recommended that medical facilities should be available throughout the island and to this end a medical school should be opened. The Colombo Medical School was thus opened in 1870 by the then Governor Sir Hercule Robinson. Dr James Loos was its first principal. Dr. E.L.Koch was the second principal in whose memory the Koch memorial clock tower, which still stands, was built in 1881. The beginnings of the medical school were modest. It was situated in the General Hospital Colombo, and had three teachers and 25 students. It offered a course of three years duration until in 1873 the course was extended to four years. Its progress was rapid. In 1880 the medical school was raised to the status of a college (renamed Ceylon Medical College) and in 1884 the course was extended to 5 years.\\n\\nIn 1875 Mudaliyar Samson Rajapakse gifted the land on which the present Faculty is located. Other philanthropists donated buildings at this site. These buildings are no more. The Anatomy block, built in 1913, is the oldest building now.In 1887, the Diploma of Licentiate of Medicine and Surgery (LMS) granted by the College became registrable with the General Medical Council (GMC) of the United Kingdom. \\n\\nThe Ceylon Medical College and the Ceylon University College, which had been established in 1921, formed the nucleus of the University of Ceylon, which came into being in 1942. The status of the Ceylon Medical College was elevated to the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Ceylon and the diploma of L.M.S. was replaced by the degree of M.B.,B.S. Until it became the Faculty of Medicine, the Medical College was administered by the Civil Medical Department and its successor the Department of Medical and Sanitary Services. Dr. W.R. Kynsey served as Principal Civil Medical Officer (PCMO) between 1875 and 1897 and contributed much towards the college in its early years. Kynsey Road, which runs between the National Hospital and the Faculty, is named after him.In 1942 the Faculty of Medicine had six Departments - Physiology, Anatomy, Pathology, Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Surgery. Departments of Public Health (Community Medicine) and Forensic Medicine were added in 1949 and 1951 respectively. At present there are 14 Departments. The Departments of Biochemistry and Pharmacology branched off from the Department of Physiology, Parasitology and Microbiology from the Department of Pathology, and Paediatrics and Psychological Medicine from the Department of Medicine. There are 5 Units in addition to these departments - the Malaria Research Unit, the Human Genetics Unit, the Molecular Biology Unit, the Medical Education Development and Research Centre (MEDARC), and the Audio-Visual Unit.From 25 students in 1870, the student number increased to about 500 in the '60s and 1533 at present. The staff strength too has increased considerably.\\n\\nThe Faculty at present provides for the education and training of undergraduates in allied health sciences. The course in Pharmacy is a well established one at the faculty while that for Physiotherapy is now three years old. In addition courses ranging from medico-legal sciences to those in medical education are regularly conducted. There is also a strong ethics review committee for processing of research projects and training of staff in ethical practices.

{"title": "Fail-deadly", "body": "Fail-deadly is a concept in nuclear military strategy which encourages deterrence by guaranteeing an immediate, automatic and overwhelming response to an attack. The term fail-deadly was coined as a contrast to fail-safe.\\n\\nIt is an example of second strike strategy, in that aggressors are discouraged from attempting a first strike attack. Under fail-deadly nuclear deterrence, policies and procedures controlling the retaliatory strike will authorize launch even if the existing command and control structure has already been neutralized by a first strike. The deterrent efficacy of such a system clearly depends on other nuclear-armed nations having foreknowledge of it. The Soviet Union used a fail-deadly system known as Dead Hand (codenamed \"Perimeter\"); it is not certain if Russia still uses it.\\n\\nA specific example of the implementation of such a strategy would work as follows: ballistic missile submarines are ordered to surface at periodic intervals to receive communications indicating that no change has occurred in the Defense Condition. Should the submarines be unable to receive the proper command and control signals indicating normal, peacetime conditions, they would be pre-programmed to launch their nuclear missiles under the assumption that command and control structures had been destroyed in a nuclear attack, and therefore retaliation was necessary. All available means of verification and all due caution would naturally be applied. This approach is obviously exceptionally dangerous for a variety of reasons. The strategy's true value is in deterrence against attack on command, control, communications, and computer (see C4I) networks by any potential adversary.\\n\\nFail-deadly is also associated with \"massive retaliation\", a deterrence strategy which ensures that the counter strike will be conducted on a larger scale than the initial attack. If an aggressor launched one missile at another party, they would get ten in return. If they launched ten, they would receive 100, and so on.\\n\\nA more prosaic example of a fail-deadly instrument is a switch which must be constantly held to prevent the triggering of an explosive, which ensures that a suicide bombing is not prevented by killing the person with the bomb.\\n\\nFail-deadly systems have been a plot device used in several works of fiction:\\n\\n"}

Miami Drive is one of the most prestigious streets in Fair Plain with many large stately homes on large lots overlooking the St. Joseph River. \\n\\nUntil the mid-1960s, Fair Plain had its own school district with a Junior High School (7th through 9th grades) and four elementary schools - Fair Plain West, Fair Plain East, Fair Plain Northwest and Fair Plain Northeast. The boundaries between the four elementary schools were the cross-roads of Colfax Avenue and Napier Avenue. Before it was expanded and the four elementary schools built, the Junior High School building was known as Fair Plain Central. The mascot of the Junior High School was the Colt and the school song was \"Onward Fair Plain\" played to the tune of \"On Wisconsin.\" In the mid-1960s, the Fair Plain School District, together with others, was consolidated into the School District of the City of Benton Harbor. \\n\\nA notable stately home in Fair Plain is the \"Elisha Gray\" home on Nickerson Avenue. Fair Plain is also the home of the WHFB-AM/FM radio station on Fairplain Avenue and the Berrien Hills Golf Club on the banks of the St. Joseph River. \\n\\nThe Fairplain Plaza, located on M-139 just outside of Fair Plain, was the first shopping center in the area. The original Fairplain Plaza was largely torn down by the late 1990s, but was subsequently rebuilt and expanded in a different format.\\n\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.4 square miles (11.5 km²), of which, 4.2 square miles (10.9 km²) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.6 km²) of it (5.39%) is water.\\n\\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 7,828 people, 3,287 households, and 2,116 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 1,860.2 per square mile (717.9/km²). There were 3,436 housing units at an average density of 816.5/sq mi (315.1/km²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 49.08% White, 47.42% Black or African American, 0.46% Native American, 0.66% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 0.88% from other races, and 1.43% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.67% of the population.\\n\\nThere were 3,287 households out of which 27.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.2% were married couples living together, 17.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.6% were non-families. 29.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.37 and the average family size was 2.91.\\n\\nIn the CDP the population was spread out with 24.5% under the age of 18, 7.7% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 24.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 91.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.7 males.\\n\\nThe median income for a household in the CDP was $37,154, and the median income for a family was $45,950. Males had a median income of $34,524 versus $24,043 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $20,344. About 10.8% of families and 16.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 30.5% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fair to Midland", "body": "Fair to Midland is an American progressive metal band formed in 1998. They are currently signed to E1 Music. According to the band's official website, their name comes from \"...an old Texan play on the term 'fair to middling'.\" The band produced two self-released albums and one album and an EP under Serjical Strike. They have recently finished recording their as yet untitled fourth studio album.\\n\\nFair to Midland was formed in 1998 by friends Andrew Darroh Sudderth and Cliff Campbell. After their independent debut album in late 2001, The Carbon Copy Silver Lining, original drummer Jason Pintler left the band and former percussionist Brett Stowers took over the drums. For their second album, inter.funda.stifle, Matt Langley joined the band. He had previously played keyboards on The Carbon Copy Silver Lining. In 2004, they released their second album, inter.funda.stifle. inter.funda.stifle was later re-released through their online merchandise store in 2009.\\n\\nThe album and the shows promoting it attracted the attention of Serj Tankian, and Fair to Midland were signed to his Serjical Strike label in 2006. The Drawn and Quartered EP was soon released on the label, featuring interviews with the band, songs from inter.funda.stifle and live recordings. Fables From a Mayfly: What I Tell You Three Times Is True, Fair to Midland's major label debut, was released in June 2007. The band chose to re-record many of the songs from inter.funda.stifle which they felt could benefit from the bigger production values art-rock mega producer David Bottrill brought to the table.\\n\\nLive at Coachella 2007 the band performed a live improvisational version of their song \"The Walls of Jericho\" featuring the guest vocals of Serj Tankian. Through the first half of 2008, Fair to Midland has toured the USA with 10 years, and Europe with Serj Tankian. They performed alongside acts such as Rage Against The Machine, Queens of the Stone Age, Smashing Pumpkins, and Muse and at sister festivals Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, two notable concert events, in both 2007 and 2008.\\n\\nFair to Midland were the winners of the Dallas Observer Music Award in the Best Metal category for both 2007 and 2008.\\n\\nOn January 9, 2010, the band was in an accident, forcing them to cancel their show at the Clubhouse Music Venue in Tempe, Arizona. Bassist Jon Dicken was admitted to the hospital as a precaution, but shortly released with no major harm. The members of the band were unharmed, but the crash, which included their van and trailer being flipped, left much of their gear destroyed. Four days later the band released a short video involving post-accident footage, entitled \"FWIW\" (standing for \"For What It's Worth\") which includes a short clip of a studio demo of a new song called \"A Loophole in Limbo\".\\n\\nIn August 2008, Fair to Midland began writing their fourth studio album. In October, drummer Brett Stowers stated on the band’s official forum that the band had so far written about 4-6 songs that were in \"various states of completion\". He also wrote that the band wanted to take their time and release the record when it’s done. On November 15, the band’s Myspace page was updated with pictures of the band in studio. As written in the blog post: \"The sound so far seems to be going in a little bit darker and more cynical direction, probably a result of 2 years of roughing it on the road, but it's not without some cool tongue-in-cheek moments as well\".\\n\\nIn more recent departures from the band, lead singer Darroh Sudderth over Facebook claims that \"a new album is on the horizon.\"\\n\\nTracks considered for the record include \"Musical Chairs\", \"Pour the Coal to 'er\" (both recorded in demo form during the sessions for Fables from a Mayfly), \"Rikki Tikki Tavi\", \"A Loophole in Limbo\", \"Bright Bulbs and Sharp Tools\", \"Uh-Oh\", \"Coppertank Island\", \"Amarillo Sleeps on My Pillow\", \"Bravo Sierra\", \"Golden Parachutes\" and \"The Greener Grass\".\\n\\nOn November 8th it was announced that the band had signed a worldwide deal with E1 Music and that the album was scheduled to be released in the spring of 2011. The album will be produced by Joe Barresi. The official pre-production started on November 15th. On November 23rd the band announced they were moving on to tracking drums, and the recording was announced to be done on December 19th, and in a recent newsletter the band announced that Joe Barresi will mix the album during the first half of January, while the expected release is due in late Spring or early Summer. The band also stated it would be \"the darkest and heaviest record\" they have ever made.\\n\\nOn December 10th, the band announced they have decided on the name of the new album, but did not disclose it.\\n\\nThe band is planning a nation-wide tour in support of the new release starting March 2011. It has also been confirmed in a recent twitter message that the new album is due out early summer\\n\\n"}

It was a conventional high-wing, strut-braced monoplane with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The pilot and three passengers were seated within a fully-enclosed cabin, and the aircraft generally resembled a scaled-down version of Fairchild's successful FC-2 design. Two prototypes were built as the Model 41 and Model 41A leading to the Model 42 production version which was built in a small series. This production version differed from the prototypes in having a redesigned, strut-braced empennage in place of the wire-braced unit of the earlier aircraft, and a more powerful version of the same Wright Whirlwind powerplant.\\n\\nOne has been rebuilt & back flying in Alaska NC106M July 2008 with a beaver engine on it, converted to 7 passenger, with rear round windows added. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fairfield Stags men's basketball", "body": "The Fairfield Stags men's basketball team represents Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut and competes in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I. The Stags play their home games in the 9,500 seat, state of the art Arena at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut and plays two games per season in Alumni Hall back on the campus of Fairfield University. The team is currently coached by Ed Cooley, the 2010 Ben Jobe National Coach of the Year. \\n\\nThe Stags have experienced the thrill of post-season tournament action twelve times having competed in the NAIB Tournament in 1951; the NCAA DII Tournament in 1960, 1961 and 1962; the National Invitational Tournament in 1973, 1974, 1978, 1996 and 2003; and the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 1986, 1987 and 1997. In the 1973 National Invitation Tournament, the Stags advanced to the second round where the team lost by one point to eventual National Champion Virginia Tech. And in the 1997 NCAA Tournament, the Stags nearly achieved a historical upset of top-seeded North Carolina after leading the Tar Heels by seven points at halftime. The team also won the MAAC Regular Season Title in 1986 and the MAAC Championship Tournament in 1986, 1987 and 1997. \\n\\nIndividually, Joe DeSantis earned All-American honors in 1979; Darren Phillip was the nation's top rebounder averaging 14 rebounds per game in 2000; and Deng Gai was the nation's top shot blocker in 2005 averaging 5.5 blocks per game which ranks #5 on the NCAA's all-time blocked shot average list. Thirteen Stags have been either drafted or signed to play in the National Basketball Association. \\n\\nThrough the efforts of Rev. Victor Leeber, S.J., Fairfield University introduced men's basketball in 1948 and has since played 59 continuous seasons of hoops through the 2007-08 season. Fairfield played its first-ever game against Brooklyn College in Brooklyn, NY, losing 46-78, and won its first-ever game that season against Hillyer College (now the University of Hartford), 47-37, in Bridgeport, CT at the Bridgeport Armory, Fairfield's original home court. During the 1950-1951 season, under new Head Coach James Hanrahan, the still fledgling program experienced its first winning season with a 16-11 overall record and received the school's first ever postseason berth in the 1951 NAIA National Men's Basketball Championship Tournament.\\n\\nDuring the 1958-1959 season Head Coach George Bisacca took over the program and proceeded to elevate the Stags to a higher level experiencing only 1 losing season in 10 years. The Stags received three straight postseason berths to the NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship Tournament between 1960 and 1962 and advanced to the 2nd round in 1960 and 1961. On the heals of this postseason success, Fairfield upgraded the program up to Division 1 hoops during the 1964-1965 season. The following year, the 1965-66 team went 19-5 and became the first Fairfield team to be ranked in the UPI/AP Top 20 poll.\\n\\nThe most successful stretch of Fairfield basketball occurred under Head Coach Fred Barakat when the Stags received three berths in the post-season NIT in six years which was chronicled in the book, 25 Years Plus One: Recounting the Meteoric Rise of Fairfield Basketball, by Connecticut sportswriter, Don Harrison. During the 1972-73 season the Stags finished with a 18-9 overall record and were invited to the post-season NIT for the first time in the programs history. In the 1st round, Captain George Groom led the Stags to a 80-76 victory over Marshall University playing before 13,904 fans at Madison Square Garden. In the 2nd round, the Stags fell 76-77 to the eventual National Champion Virginia Tech Gooblers before more than 17,000 fans. The Stags followed up this success with a 17-9 overall record and a second invitation to the post-season NIT during the 1973-74 season. In the 1st round, Captain Richie O'Connor led the Stags to a 37-32 halftime lead before falling 65-66 to the University of Hawaii before 17,739 fans. The Stags returned to the post-season NIT for the third time during the 1977-78 season following the program's first 20 win season (22-5 overall) and a record point setting 123-108 victory over the then 14th ranked Holy Cross Crusaders. In the 1st round of the tournament, Junior Mark Young led the Stags with a 32 performance in a 93-108 losing effort to the Dayton Flyers.\\n\\nFairfield earned its first berth in NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship in 1986 after sweeping though the St. Peter's Peacocks, Iona Gael and Holy Cross Crusaders in route to winning the MAAC Championship. The Stags faced the Illinois Fighting Illini in the first round of Southeast Regional of the 1986 NCAA Tournament. Jeff Gromos led all Fairfield scorers with 16 points, followed by Pat Yerina with 13 points. The Stags were coached by first year head coach Mitch Buonoguoro and ended the year with a 24-7 record, the most wins in school history.\\n\\nThe following season, Fairfield overcame an injured-plaqued season to mount an improble run to its second consecutive MAAC Championship and to earn its second consecutive bid to the 1987 NCAA Tournament. The Stags defeated the LaSalle Explorer, Army Black Knights and needed the heroics of a last second shot by A. J. Wynder to help propel the Stags past the Iona Gaels in overtime and to the MAAC Championship. The Stags faced the top-seeded and eventual national champion Indiana Hoosiers in the first round of the Midwest Regional before 29,610 fans in the Hoosier Dome. Jeff Gromos led all Fairfield scorers with 21 points, followed by A. J. Wynder with 15 points.\\n\\nDuring the 1995-96 season Head Coach Paul Cormier led the Stags to a 20-10 overall record, an appearance in the MAAC championship game and the program's fourth berth in the NIT. In the opening round of the NIT, the Stags played the Providence College Friars before 6,368 fans at the New Haven Coliseum. Led by Shannon Bowman the Stags held a 46-43 half time lead before eventually falling 78-69 to the Friars.\\n\\nPicked to win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference in 1996-97, Fairfield suffered through an injury-plagued regular season and finished in last place. But the Stags made a Cinderella run in the MAAC tournament, defeating top seed Iona, St. Peter's and Canisius to capture the league's automatic berth in the 1997 NCAA Tournament despite an 11-18 record. Fairfield then gave top seeded North Carolina all it could handle in the first round of the East Region in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Stags opened a 37-28 lead early in the second half before their bid to become the first 16 seed to win a NCAA Tournament game fell 82-74. The seven point loss still stands as the last single digit loss by a #16 seed to a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Stag legend Greg Francis '97 almost single-handedly upset the Tar Heels scoring 26 points including eight three-pointers. Following the game, legendary North Carolina coach Dean Smith said \"I had to find Francis after the game but I couldn't shake his hand because it was so hot.\" \\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIn 2002, Stags basketball moved from the comfy confines of the on-campus Alumni Hall to the new state-of-the-art 9,500 seat Arena at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, CT. During that same season, Head Coach Tim O'Toole '87 led the Stags to an 19-12 overall record, an appearance to the MAAC tournament championship game, and the program's fifth berth in the NIT. In the opening round of the NIT, Nick Delfico led the Stags with 14 points in a 90-78 losing effort to the Boston College Eagles before 6,500 fans at the Arena at Harbor Yard. During 2004-2005 season, Deng Gai '05 led the nation in shots blocked with 5.5 blocks per game and graduated as number eight on the NCAA's all-time blocked shots list.\\n\\nOn April 11, 2006, Ed Cooley (former Boston College Eagles assistant coach) became the program's eleventh Head Coach ushering in a new era of Stags basketball. During the first round of the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) the Stags overcame a 27-point deficit with under 16 minutes to play to defeat George Mason in overtime, 101-96. The 27-point comeback is the biggest in Division I postseason history. The Stags were led by senior Mike Evanovich who finished with a career-high 32 points and a school record nine three-pointers including one with 0.9 seconds in regulation to send the game into overtime. Fellow senior Anthony Johnson led the Stags in overtime scoring 9 points and finished with 25 points in the game. And at the conclusion of the 2010 season, Coach Cooley received the inaugural 2010 Ben Jobe National Coach of the Year Award, presented annually to the top minority men's basketball coach in the nation, in recogniton of his coaching the Stags through numerous injuries to a near school record 23-win season.\\n\\nThe following Stag players were selected in the National Basketball Association draft or signed as free agents:\\n\\nWVOF is the home of Fairfield Stags men's basketball.

Many people believed that, because of this new surge of \"celebs-as-trendsetters\", some fashion regulars and legitimate designers did not attend the 2008 fashion event. Instead, attendees turned their attention to the designs of \"The Hills\" star Lauren Conrad, who debuted her collection during the week, Nicky Hilton, and The Pussycat Dolls.\\n\\nSue Wong was one of the designers that openly voiced her opinion about celebrity designers. Wong calls the emerging trend \"absolutely bogus.\" Wong is usually a regular at the Mercedes-Benz LA Fashion Week, but decided not to show in 2008, claiming she wanted to concentrate on doing something \"different.\"\"Sure, every celebrity and his brother wants to be a fashion designer\", said Wong, who has been designing since 1968. \"It's not like anybody can pick it up and do it. It's a science. You need to know fit and construction.\" Wong has also claimed that the celebrities are just capitalizing on their \"15 minutes of fame.\" Normally, up-and-coming designers would not get the kind of exposures celebrities get for their clothing lines.\\n\\nLauren Conrad has tried to defend herself against the criticisms and pressures put on her before her fashion launch. Conrad, who has trained at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, said the additional pressure thrust upon her Fashion Week debut made her nervous while working on the line. She described it as \"California chic\", basing this season on a recent trip to Paris reflected in simple, clean pieces accessorized with berets, netting, leather gloves, bows and lace.\"I will probably never have the respect I want in the fashion industry, but I can work hard every day to try and prove myself\", Conrad said. \"Can I really be criticized for taking advantage on an opportunity that allows me to have what I've always wanted?\"\\n\\nWong still voiced her skepticism. \"Let's see whether she can survive and thrive. It takes so much dedication\", she said. \"You gotta really pay your dues to be a serious artist.\" A review by Jenny Peters of Fashion Wire Daily criticized her debut line, writing, \"There was absolutely nothing new or innovative in her collection.\"\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fall River Government Center", "body": " thumbthumbFall River Government Center (also known as \"city hall\") is the location of the municipal government offices in the city of Fall River, Massachusetts, United States. Located at One Government Center, and constructed directly over Interstate 195, it was the first public building built over a Federal interstate highway. It replaced the city's historic 19th century city hall which had been demolished in the early 1960s as part of the construction of Interstate 195, which cuts through the center of the city's downtown area. Delayed and plagued by problems during construction, the new city hall opened in 1976. In 2008, the building and site underwent a multi-million dollar exterior renovation.\\n\\nThe current Fall River Government Center is located at the historic \"crossroads\" of the city, at the intersection of Central Street (Bedford Street) and Main Street. Fall River's first town hall was destroyed in the first great downtown fire of 1843, which destroyed over 200 buildings in the center of town.\\n\\nThe city's historic 19th century city hall was demolished in the early 1960s for construction of Interstate 195, which cut through the heart of downtown Fall River. It was a time of so-called \"urban renewal\" in the city after the tough years since the collapse of the city's textile industry in the 1920s and 1930s. Several other 19th and early 20th century buildings were also demolished as part of the new highway construction. The old city hall, which had survived two fires was constructed directly over the Quequechan River, the source of power for the early textile mills. As part of the highway project, the river was diverted into an underground culvert which parallels the highway, along the south side of the current city hall. Two granite columns from the front of the old city hall are located across from the current building, along Sullivan Drive, next to the Academy Building.\\n\\nThe new Government Center (city hall), constructed of reinforced concrete and glass, in the popular Brutalist style of the 1960s and 1970s opened in 1976, after years of construction delays and quality control problems. The main buildings occupies a space further east than the original city hall, which was closer to South Main Street. A wing of the current building, which contains the city council chambers is located at the west end of the site, closer to South Main Street. A plaza was created north of the new city hall, between the adjacent United States Post Office. The original scheme for the new city hall included a parking garage, that was later eliminated from the design.\\n\\nThe main building is a concrete cube, approximately 144 feet (44 m) square, with a smaller glass-enclosed cube forming the middle floors. The building is set atop an elevated \"basement\" containing mechanical and storage areas constructed atop the steel platform which spans the highway. The platform also includes South Main Street to the west and Second Street to the east, creating a 900 foot (274 m) long tunnel.\\n\\nIn March 1999, concrete slabs forming the ceiling of the tunnel beneath Government Center fell onto the westbound lanes of Interstate 195, causing a six-vehicle accident in which a minivan overturned. Amazingly nobody was killed in the incident which was later determine to have resulted from corrosion of the support brackets which held the concrete slabs. As a result, state highway officials ordered the immediate removal of all the concrete ceiling slabs beneath Government Center. This however, left the underside of the building vulnerable to fire, in the event of an accident within the tunnel.\\n\\nAs a result of the fire protection panels being removed from beneath Government Center, it was decided by state and local officials that all trucks carrying hazardous cargo (gasoline, oil, etc.) could not pass under the building along Interstate 195. For several years, these vehicles were detoured through the city streets around Government Center. In May 2008, with the replacement of the concrete panels complete, this restriction was removed.\\n\\nFall River\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Falling Creek Ironworks", "body": "Falling Creek Ironworks was the first iron production facility in North America and was established prior to 1619 by Spanish Proprietors. The Colonial Ironworks passed to the French crown with the marriage of Henry XIII to Anne of Austria. In 1619 ownership passed from France to England, specifically to the ownership of the Virginia Company of London in Henrico Cittie (sic) on Falling Creek near its confluence with the James River. It was short-lived due to an attack by Native Americans in 1622. Mention of this transition to English Ownership was preserved in the Land Grant Records of Virginia.\\n\\nOn July 21 1646 George Ludlowe Esqr received  in York Co, that was adjacent to the Falling Creek Mill lands which was in part granted to Martin Baker (Martin Fouquet) as Yorke Plantation by purchase from George Mosso, esquire (esquiem). And which was mortgaged together with an additional  by Sir John Harve (John_Harvey_(Virginia)) as well as to pay transportation costs for 2 persons (Jean du Fer and his brother Francois, two surviving children of the 1622 massacre) as well as  to pay for transportation for 15 persons (mill workers): Philip Bowden (Philip Bourdain), John Nerve (Jean Nervais), Henry Davis, John Bernberry (Jean Banbury/VanBerry), Nicholos Iego (Nicholas Legos), Bassett Sax (Basset d'Sais), Richard Oxon (Richard d'Hausson/Dawson), Thomas Bacock (Thomas Picot), Mary Fitch, John Fleet (Jean van Fleet), and John Mission (Jean Monceaux/Muscheon), Sara Spittlewood, Richard Colins, Thomas Lewis, John Gerford (Gifford) and William Benton, Robert Caldwell. \\n\\nThe long-lost site was rediscovered in the early 21st century. It is now located in Chesterfield County, about  south of the fall line of the James River at present-day Richmond, Virginia. Archaeological and related research work at the site was ongoing as of March 2007. \\n\\nThe proprietary Virginia Company of London established the first permanent English settlement in the Virginia Colony at Jamestown on May 14, 1607. The young colony struggled for years to develop self-sufficiency and successful exports. During the first five years, most of the colonists died from disease, starvation, and attacks by the Native Americans. \\n\\nAfter 1612, non-native strains of tobacco emerged as a cash crop, and plantation and other outposts from Jamestown spread downstream and up the James River toward the head of navigation (fall line) at present-day Richmond. \\n\\nThe geology of Virginia's terrain changes from the sandy coastal plain of the Tidewater Region to the more hilly and rocky Piedmont Region along the north-south fall line. At Richmond, the generally west to east flowing James River turns almost due south and essentially flows parallel to and just east of the fall line for about , before turning east again near Drewry's Bluff. On the west bank of this section, the Piedmont terrain contained the ore deposits needed to make iron, but was still adjacent to the navigable portion of the James River through the Tidewater Region. A local tributary, Falling Creek, flowed downhill into the James River, providing the water power needed. \\n\\nNear the confluence of Falling Creek with the James River, the colonists identified the site with the combination of ore deposits, water power, and access to navigable waters for shipping which were needed for their desired iron production facility. Although the outpost was one of the most remote from Jamestown, beginning in 1619, the Falling Creek Ironworks was established there. It was the first iron production facility in North America. \\n\\nRecords which have survived indicate that the ironworks was able to produce some quantity of iron. However, from the extant records, it cannot be determined whether the ironworks had begun full production before operations were interrupted by the Indian Massacre of 1622. \\n\\nOn March 22, 1622, the Powhatan Confederacy of Native Americans tribes under the leadership of Chief Opechancanough conducted a series of coordinated surprise attacks on almost all the English settlements along the James River. Jamestown was spared only due to a timely warning. The massacre resulted in the death of about a third of the colonists. Two women and three children were among the 27 killed at Falling Creek Ironworks, leaving only two colonists alive, and the facilities were destroyed. Sir Thomas Dale's progressive development a few miles downstream at Henricus was also wiped out. \\n\\nFrom 1750 until 1781, Archibald Cary operated a forge there, until it was destroyed, by Benedict Arnold, during the Revolutionary War.\\n\\nLater attempts to restore the ironworks were unsuccessful, and the exact site itself eventually became lost.\\n\\nThe exact site of the Falling Creek Ironworks was unknown until relatively recently. According to an article in the Richmond ''Times-Dispatch'' newspaper on January 20, 2007, the heavy rains in the late summer of 2006 apparently eroded the creek bank and uncovered timbers of the furnace which were part of the structure. Early in 2007, a Chesterfield County Department of Utilities employee, who is also an amateur archaeologist, spotted them. According to the article, \"The rest of the furnace is believed to be buried in the creek bank.\"\\n\\nThe location of the ironworks has long been suspected. A number of limited archaeological excavations and surveys were conducted by the Archaeological Society of Virginia, The College of William and Mary, Browning and Associates, LTD., and others. The location of the blast furnace was only confirmed in 1999 when Archaeo-Physics, LLC (working with Browning and Associates) did a comprehensive geophysical survey. A large magnetic anomaly consistent with the fired hearth of a blast furnace was located. In addition a number of other features were identified (probably buildings related to either the Falling Creek Ironworks or Archibald Cary's 1750-81 Forge). \\n\\nAs of March 2007, the Falling Creek Ironworks Foundation and Chesterfield County (which now owns the site) is in the process of having the timber which was recently exposed in the eroded creek bank dated using a process called dendrochronology. An excavation is planned for later in 2007 to more fully expose the timbers and possibly the blast furnace itself.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Falls City, Texas", "body": "Falls City , a mile southeast of the Wilson county line and seven miles northwest of Karnes City in northern Karnes County, owes its development to the railroad. Two earlier communities, Marcelina and Home Valley, had been located in the vicinity in the 1850s and 1860s, but people were not induced to settle the area until 1886, when the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway built a switch and depot called Brackenridge, named after railroad benefactor George W. Brackenridge. To provide postal service for the settlement that developed, the post office of Skiles was established a mile west of the depot in 1887. On November 28, 1893, it was moved closer to the tracks on the east side of the river, where it was consolidated with Brackenridge and renamed Falls City, after several nearby natural waterfalls. On June 25, 1893, a train robbery at Brackenridge resulted in the only hanging at Karnes City, the new county seat. In 1895 Falls City had one general store, a post office, two saloons, a lumberyard, a hotel, a depot, two livery stables, and a steam mill and gin. The principal place of business was the Schulz Mercantile Company, which operated in a large brick building until it burned down in 1935. The site was later occupied by the Falls City National Bank.\\n\\nA number of people from Panna Maria and Cestohowa moved to Falls City, where they could receive the benefits of a railroad. As a result Falls City became a predominantly Polish-American settlement. In 1902 Holy Trinity Catholic Church was erected; a parish school opened in 1911. In 1924 the Columbian Hall was built for the Knights of Columbus; it was replaced by the Falls City Community Hall in 1983. In 1931 a new Catholic school, built for $4,000, enrolled 100 students. In 1938 a public school was built, and a high school was added in 1950. Polish-American farmers east and west of the town did most of their trading at Falls City, which incorporated on September 28, 1946. The discovery of oil helped the town to grow. After the discovery of uranium in 1958 near Tordilla Hill, ten miles west of Falls City, uranium mining and milling developed. In the mid-1970s the town was seriously divided over the uranium mines, which were said to contaminate the land and water. Businessmen wanted the mines to continue operation, but farmers did not. The conflict continued in the 1990s. By 1993 the uranium activity, except for a multimillion-dollar reclamation project by federal authorities, was all but over.

{"title": "Familial hemiplegic migraine", "body": "Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is an autosomal dominant classical migraine subtype that typically includes hemiparesis (weakness of half the body) during the aura phase. It can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as ataxia, coma and epileptic seizure. There is clinical overlap in some FHM patients with episodic ataxia type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, benign familial infantile convulsion, and alternating hemiplegia of childhood. There are 3 known loci for FHM. FHM1, which accounts for approximately 50% of FHM patients, is caused by mutations in a gene coding for the P/Q-type calcium channel α subunit, CACNA1A. FHM1 is also associated with cerebellar degeneration. FHM2, which accounts for <25% of FHM cases, is caused by mutations in the Na/K-ATPase gene ATP1A2. FHM3 is a rare subtype of FHM and is caused by mutations in a sodium channel α-subunit coding gene, SCNA1. These three subtypes do not account for all cases of FHM, suggesting the existence of at least one other locus (FHM4). Many of the non-familial cases of hemiplegic migraine (sporadic hemiplegic migraine) are also caused by mutations at these loci.\\n\\nFHM can be loosely divided into two categories: with and without cerebellar signs. Cerebellar signs refer to ataxia, sometimes episodic and other times progressive, that can accompany FHM1 mutations and is caused by degeneration of the cerebellum. These cerebellar signs result in a phenotypic overlap between FHM and both episodic ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia. This is unsurprising as subtypes of these disorders (FHM1, EA2 and SCA6) are allelic, i.e., they result from mutations in the same gene. The other forms of FHM seem to be distinguishable only on the basis of their genetic cause.\\n\\nThere are also non-familial cases of hemiplegic migraine, termed sporadic hemiplegic migraine. These cases seem to have the same causes as the familial cases and represent de novo mutation. Sporadic cases are also clinically identical to familial cases with the exception of a lack of family history of attacks.\\n\\nFHM signs overlap significantly with those of migraine with aura. In short, FHM is typified by migraine with aura associated with hemiparesis and, in FHM1, cerebellar degeneration. This cerebellar degeneration can result in episodic or progressive ataxia. FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile convulsion (BFIC) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Other symptoms are altered consciousness (in fact, some cases seem related to head trauma), gaze-evoked nystagmus and coma. Aura symptoms, such as numbness and blurring of vision, typically persist for 30–60 minutes. These signs typically first manifest themselves in the first or second decade of life.\\n\\nSee the equivalent section in the main migraine article.\\n\\nIt is believed that FHM mutations lead to migraine susceptibility by lowering the threshold for cortical-spreading-depression generation. The FHM1 and FHM3 mutations are occur in ion channel expressed in neuron. These mutations may lead to both the hyper and hypoexcitable neurons that might underlie cortical-spreading-depression. It is even less clear how the mutations seen in FHM2 patients might lead to FHM symptoms as the gene mutated in FHM2 is expressed primarily in astrocyte. One proposal states that the depolarization of astrocytes caused by haploinsufficiency of the ATP1A2 Na+/K+-ATPase causes increased release of compounds such as adenosine from astrocytes. These compounds then interact with neighboring neurons, altering their excitability and leading to cortical-spreading-depression and migraine.\\n\\nDiagnosis of FHM is made according to the following criteria:\\n\\nSporadic forms follow the same diagnostic criteria, with the exception of family history.\\n\\nIn all cases, family and patient history is used for diagnosis. EEG and brain imaging techniques, such as MRI and CAT scan, are used to rule out epilepsy and to test for cerebellar degeneration, respectively. With the discovery of causative genes, genetic sequencing can also be used to verify diagnosis (though not all genetic loci are known).\\n\\nThe first discovered FHM locus was the CACNA1A gene (originally named CACNL1A4), which encodes the P/Q-type calcium channel Ca2.1. There are currently 17 known mutation in this channel, see Table 1, and these mutations are distributed throughout the channel. Some of these mutations result in patients with notable cerebellar degeneration or other dysfunction. 15 of these mutants have received at least some further analysis at the electrophysiological level to attempt to determine how they might lead to the FHM1 phenotype. There is increasing contradiction in the literature as to the end result of these mutations on channel kinetics and neuronal excitability.\\n\\nA good example of this contradiction can be seen in the literature regarding the R192Q mutation. The first investigation of this mutation, using the rabbit isoform of the channel expressed in oocyte, found that it did not alter any measured channel properties. A subsequent report, using human channels expressed in HEK293 Cells, found a small hyperpolarizing shift in the midpoint for activation, a result common among FHM1 mutants. This shift results in channels that open at more negative potentials and, thus, have a higher open probability than wild-type channels at most potentials. This report also found that the R192Q mutant produced almost twice as much whole-cell current compared to wild-type channels. This is not due to a change in single channel conductance but to an equivalent increase in channel density. A subsequent group noticed that this mutation is in a region important for modulation by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs). GPCR activation leads to inhibition of wild-type Ca2.1 currents. R192Q mutant channel currents are also decreased by GPCR activation, but by a smaller amount. A more recent group has confirmed some of these results by creating a R192Q knock-in mouse. They confirmed that the R192Q mutant activates at more negative potentials and that neurons producing these channels have much larger whole-cell current. This resulted in a much larger quantal content (the number of neurotransmitter packets released per action potential) and generally enhanced neurotransmitter release in R192Q expressing neurons versus wild-type. Consequently, these mutant mice were more susceptible to cortical-spreading-depression than their wild-type counterparts. The most recent experiments on this mutant, however, have contradicted some of these results. In Ca2.1 knockout neuron transfected with human channels, P/Q-type currents from mutant channels are actually smaller than their wild-type counterpart. They also found a significant decrease in calcium influx during depolarization, leading to decreased quantal content, in mutant versus wild-type expressing neurons. Neurons expressing mutant channels were also less able to mediate inhibitory input and have smaller inhibitory postsynaptic current through P/Q-type channels. Further testing with this and other mutants is required to determine their end affect on human physiology.\\n\\nrightThe second subtype of familial hemiplegic migraine, FHM2, is caused by mutations in the gene ATP1A2 that encodes a Na/K-ATPase. This Na/K-ATPase is heavily expressed in astrocyte and helps to set and maintain their reversal potential. There are 29 known mutations in this gene associated with FHM2, Table 2, many clustering in the large intracellular loop between membrane-spanning segments 4 and 5, Figure 1. 12 of these mutations have been studied by expression in model cells. All but one have shown either complete loss of function or more complex decreases in ATPase activity or potassium sensitivity. Astrocytes expressing these mutant ion pump will have much higher resting potentials and are believed to lead to disease through a poorly understood mechanism.\\n\\nThe final known locus for FHM is the SCN1A gene, which encodes a sodium channel α subunit. The only study so far that has found mutations in this gene discovered the same Q1489K mutation in 3 of 20 families (15%) with 11 other kindreds (55%) already having mutations in CACNA1A or ATP1A2. This mutation is located in a highly conserved region of an intracellular loop connecting domains three and four. This mutation results in a greatly hastened (2-4 fold) recovery from inactivation compared to wild-type. As this channel is important for action potential generation in neuron, it is expected that the Q1489K mutant results in hyperexcitable neurons.\\n\\nThe final known locus for FHM maps to the q-arm of chromosome 1. There are a number of attractive candidate genes in this area, though no mutations in them have yet been linked to FHM4.\\n\\nSee the equivalent section in the main migraine article.\\n\\nPatients with FHM are encouraged to avoid activities that may trigger their attacks. Minor head trauma is a common attack precipitant, so FHM sufferers should avoid contact sports. Acetazolamide or standard drugs are often used to treat attacks, though those leading to vasoconstriction should be avoided due to the risk of stroke.\\n\\nPrenatal screening is not typically done for FHM, however it may be performed if requested. As penetrance is high, individuals found to carry mutations should be expected to develop signs of FHM at some point in life.\\n\\nMigraine itself is a very common disorder, occurring in 15-20% of the population. Hemiplegic migraine, be it familial or spontaneous, is less prevalent, 0.01% prevalence according to one report.

It defines marriage \"as a personal union in which the spouses reciprocally give and receive.\"\\n\\nAmong other observations, the document restates the opposition to artificial birth control stated earlier in Humanae Vitae, and (briefly) mentions opposition to abortion. It also discusses the responsibility and expectations of the family regarding the education of children. It continues with a description of the expectations of the family regarding the larger society, including service to the poor.\\n\\nThe final (and longest) portion of the document describes expectations of the family which more directly involve religion in daily life, relating it to several of the Catholic sacraments, particularly marriage, and strongly urging family prayer. In particular, this section of the document restates the expectation of a permanent Catholic union for all members of the church seeking marriage.

It ran for four seasons on the A&E Network.\\n\\nThe show mainly focused on the relationships between the employees, for instance Chuck Wissmiller and his three daughters - all of whom were working at the mortuary during the show's run. At times it also focused on the deceased that passed through the mortuary. The deceased themselves were seen from time to time on the show, but care was taken by crew to ensure the privacy of the deceased. While the work done in the preparation room was shown, the more graphic portions of the work were not shown in order to keep a PG rating.\\n\\nFamily Plots was cancelled in late 2006 due to some law suits directed at the Network. Fan sites and clubs reacted strongly to the cancellation and there had been indications that A&E executives were reconsidering the cancellation.  Rumors also abounded of the show being shopped to other networks.  There is current talk of the Wissmiller Family doing a \"Spin-Off\" show due to the huge fan base.\\n\\nThe show is aired on the Seven Network in Australia, in late time slots between 11pm and 1am.\\n\\nSince the cancellation of the series, a number of the staff members have left the mortuary. Chuck has retired and Shonna left in the summer of 2006 to retire early. Emily and Melissa left as well. Rick Sadler was fired in March of 2007 and had to surrender all of his professional Funeral licenses because of individual professional illegal activity. David Moravee had also left the mortuary and was working at the El Camino Mortuary in San Diego, but later returned as the new general manager of Poway-Bernardo Mortuary since the departure of Rick Sadler. He has since resigned the manager's position and left the mortuary.\\n\\nIn May 2007, mortuary owner Carl Comer confirmed that he had fired Sadler and was taking a more direct role in running the mortuary. The mortuary has recently had a number of legal troubles with the state of California, which Comer has stated were due to actions taken by Sadler during his time at the mortuary. The state had in April accused the mortuary of using an unlicensed person to perform embalming, and accused Sadler of ordering the staff to cover up that fact. Later the state cited the mortuary for allowing its worker's compensation policy to lapse. The mortuary has since purchased a new policy. Comer and the mortuary challenged the state's decision to revoke their licenses.\\n\\nBoth Sadler and Comer later each reached separate settlement agreements with the state of California, which took effect on November 26, 2007. Sadler agreed to surrender his funeral director and embalming licenses. Comer's settlement agreement resulted in the state of California allowing the mortuary to continue operating, with the business being placed on probation for a three year period. The state has acknowledged that while Comer was not directly involved in the illegal embalmings he was the owner of the business and as such had legal responsibility.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act", "body": "The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act,  is a United States federal law that gives the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate the tobacco industry. A signature element of the law imposes new warnings and labels on tobacco packaging and their advertisements, with the goal of discouraging minors and young adults from smoking.\\n\\nPassage of the law was supported by the American Cancer Society, whose CEO noted in a press release that \"[t]his bill forces Big Tobacco to disclose the poisons in its products and has the power to finally break the dangerous chain of addiction for generations to come.\" The ACS press release also noted that the legislation would \"require cigarette companies to disclose all ingredients used in cigarettes and to stop using words like 'light' and 'ultra-light' to give the impression that some tobacco products have a lower health risk.\" The legislation also garnered support from the American Heart Association, whose CEO noted that the bill \"provides a tremendous opportunity to finally hold tobacco companies accountable and restrict efforts to addict more children and adults.\" \\n\\nThe law was criticized by some as ineffectual, with community health sciences professor Michael Siegel stating that it \"creates the appearance of regulation without allowing actual regulation.\" Critics argue that without the authority to eliminate nicotine completely, the reduction of nicotine levels in cigarettes may result in compensation by existing smokers, increasing their cigarette smoke inhalation to consume a level of nicotine which will satisfy their cravings. In addition, marketing restrictions enacted by the bill make it more difficult to promote safer smokeless alternatives to cigarettes (though there is no consensus that smokeless tobacco products are, in fact, safer). The restrictions have been disputed on the grounds of free speech, with valid claims that the legislation violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\n\\nThe bill bans flavored cigarettes, including cloves, cinnamon, candy, and fruit flavors, with a special exception for menthol cigarette. Because the exception helps the largest maker of menthols, Philip Morris, and eliminates potential competition, the bill has been nicknamed the Marlboro Monopoly act of 2009. Philip Morris strongly supports FDA regulation. The exemption was reportedly influenced by the Congressional Black Caucus. The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee provisioned under the bill is to submit a recommendation on menthol cigarettes to the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services no later than one year after its establishment.\\n\\nOn March 21, 2000, the Supreme Court in FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. held that based on their reading of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, particularly when considering \"Congress’ subsequent tobacco-specific legislation,\" that Congress had not given the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. Thus the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was introduced to respond to the decision, which had held that the Clinton administration's FDA had \"overreached\" its Congressionally delegated authority, thus giving the FDA the authority the Court determined it had lacked.\\n\\nThe bill passed the United States House of Representatives on April 2, 2009, by a vote of 298 to 112. The House bill had 178 cosponsors and the companion legislation in the Senate,  had 57 cosponsors. On May 20, 2009, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions ordered the Senate bill to be reported favorably with amendments on a 15-8 vote.\\n\\nCapitol Hill newspaper The Hill reported on May 25, 2009, that Senate Majority Leader Reid plans to move on the bill during the month of June 2009; however it noted that Senators Burr and Hagan of North Carolina were proposing alternative legislation.\\n\\nOn June 2, the Senate voted 84-11 to proceed to consideration of the House bill. On June 8, the Senate voted 61-30 on cloture on amendments to the Senate bill. The \"Senate bill requires that cigarette health warning labels be large enough to make up 50 percent of the front and rear panels of the package and that the word “warning” appear in capital letters.\"On June 11, the Senate passed H.R. 1256 by a vote of 79-17, with 3 Senators not voting. Passage of the legislation came a week later than was originally scheduled. The Senate's version of the bill was approved by the House on June 12, by a bipartisan vote of 307-97.\\n\\nMedia accounts noted that the opposition in the Senate was largely from tobacco farming states, particularly Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, with the only Democrat in opposition being Kay Hagan, from North Carolina. Notable exceptions were Virginia Senators Jim Webb and Mark Warner who supported the measure, despite the state's connection to the tobacco industry.\\n\\nThe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was signed into law on June 22, 2009 by President Barack Obama.\\n\\nThe bill makes no provisions that ban the import of the banned items for personal consumption, only for \"sale or distribution\".

{"title": "Fanaa (film)", "body": "Fanaa (Hindi: फ़ना, Urdu: فناء, English: Destroyed in love) is a 2006 Hindi romance film, starring Aamir Khan and Kajol in pivotal roles. It is directed by Kunal Kohli who previously directed Hum Tum, and is produced under Yash Raj Films. The film also stars Rishi Kapoor, Kirron Kher, Tabu, and Shruti Seth. It bears many similarities to the US film and book Eye of the Needle.\\n\\nFanaa was released on 26 May 2006, in India. It was banned in the state of Gujarat due to protests against the lead actor Aamir Khan. Aamir Khan plays the role of a tourist guide in Delhi while Kajol plays a Kashmiri blind girl. The movie was the first to showcase Aamir Khan and Kajol's romantic pairing, even though they had acted together in Ishq in 1998. Many critics opined that the movie works largely due to the chemistry of the leads. Film's title is derived from Sufi term, \"Fanaa\" (Arabic: annihilation).\\n\\nRishi Kapoor and Kiron Kher play the role of Kajol's parents. The film marked the comeback of Kajol, who was last seen in Karan Johar's film, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.\\n\\nZooni Ali Beg (Kajol) is a blind Kashmiri girl who travels without her parents for the first time with a dance troupe to Delhi to perform in a ceremony for Independence Day. On her journey, she meets Rehan Khan (Aamir Khan), a Casanova tour guide who flirts with her. Although her friends warn Zooni about him, she cannot resist falling in love with him and he takes her on a private tour of New Delhi. They share what both seem to consider their first and only night together before she has to leave. However, on the day of her departure, Rehan slips into the train and, with the blessing of her friends, carries Zooni away, seemingly singifying the beginning of their life together. With Rehan's encouragement, Zooni undergoes surgery to reverse her blindness. rehan leaves to pick up Zooni's parents from the train station, promising to be there when she opens her eyes.\\n\\nWhen Zooni does come out of surgery, her parents are there, but Rehan is missing. A terrible accident has occurred, seemingly orchestrated by terrorists. They bring her a scrap of cloth, which she recognizes as a sweater she'd made for Rehan, discovered amongst the debris. Rehan is presumed dead, and the mourning, guilt-ridden Zooni returns to Kashmir.\\n\\nSeven years later, the terrorists are about to pull off a huge strike as a part of their plan. With parts stolen from India, Pakistan and Russia, they hope to build a nuclear explosive device. This device is capable of destroying a whole city—New Delhi or Islamabad—five million people within a ten mile radius. They will use it to pressure both countries into leaving Kashmir. A critical part is missing: the detonator or electronic \"trigger\" device. A still-living Rehan, who had faked his death to cover up his tracks after the accident (which he had caused) is to bring in this trigger. \\n\\nRehan infiltrates an Indian army unit that is taking the trigger back to Delhi to safeguard it from theft by the insurgents. During a helicopter transport in a remote area, he drugs his colleagues, steals the trigger, destroys the helicopter with a hand grenade and escapes by parachute. A key intelligence operative named Malini Tyagi (Tabu) realizes who he is, but cannot deploy forces quickly enough to stop Rehan. He is wounded by the troops, but escapes. Tyagi orders a communications blackout in the area so that he will not be able to contact the IKF.\\n\\nExhausted, wounded, and incommunicado with a storm building, Rehan seeks shelter in a remote house. He is shocked to find that the house belongs to Zooni, her father, and Zooni's young son, whom she has named Rehan after his supposedly deceased father. Neither of them recognize him: Zooni had never seen Rehan, as she was blind when they met, and her father had never met him, having not come to Delhi until the day of Rehan's supposed death. The child Rehan is very taken with the man, whom he calls \"the dead man\" (and later, to Zooni's distress, asks if he can call him \"Papa), and the adult Rehan likewise develops an affection for the little boy. Later, Rehan admits to his identity, though he cannot explain what he has done for the seven years since they parted, or why he played dead. Nevertheless, he still loves Zooni and she eventually realizes that she too loves him, and they marry in a simple ceremony performed by her father.\\n\\nSoon afterward, through a TV broadcast, Zooni and her father separately discover that Rehan is the terrorist for whom a manhunt is in progress. Her father tries to stop Rehan, taking him to an Army friend's house so he can use his radio transmitter and then attempting to shoot him. Instead, Rehan, determined not to be discovered, accidentally pushes Ali off a cliff to his death, then uses the radio to contact the IKF. The IKF tell him they will send a pick-up helicopter the next morning. Then, when the army officer discovers Rehan in his home, Rehan kills him too.\\n\\nZooni finds her father dead, floating by under the ice in the river near which Zooni and her son are playing. When Rehan returns home, and tells her that her father is at the army officer's house drinking rum, she suspects that Rehan killed him. She takes the trigger to the army friend's house, and upon finding the colonel dead, radios the army. Tyagi apprises her of the seriousness of the danger, and the risk to millions of lives should the IKF get the device. Before the police or army arrives, Rehan finds her, and tries to convince her to give him the \"trigger\" so he can give it to his grandfather, who is arriving by helicopter. He promises her that no one will actually set off the bomb (\"It's just a threat\") and tells her this is the only way they can have a happy future together. he refuses to listen to any of her protests or begging. Grieved, but determined to stop him, Zooni runs out of the house after him and shoots him, crying \"I love you, Rehan\". Rehan's grandfather, witnessing the event from the helicopter, trains his gun on Zooni, but Tyagi arrives in time with an Indian army helicopter and shoots the terrorist leader and the helicopter down with a pistol. They collect the trigger as Rehan dies in Zooni's arms.\\n\\nThe final scene shows Zooni and little Rehan laying flowers on the graves of Rehan (Sr.) and Mr. Ali Beg. Rehan asks if his father was a bad man, and Zooni tells him that he was doing what he felt was right. Rehan kisses his father's grave and tells him that he loves him. Zooni tells her son, \"It is easy to choose between right and wrong. But to choose the greater of two goods or the lesser of two evils…those are the choices of our life.\" thus recalling a line quoted by her father near the beginning of the film.\\n\\nThe film has grossed $22,175,908 worldwide. In India the film grossed $17.7m, $187,187 from Australia, $2,18m from the British market and $2,105,352 from the US market. On release, the film broke almost all previous records and became instant blockbuster. The direction of the movie received mixed but mostly positive reviews from critics. The critics however generally agreed on the performances of the main actors, Aamir Khan and Kajol, as well as their chemistry. the film is now considered classic by filmwallahs.\\n\\nThe film was originally planned to be shot in Kashmir before the lead heroine backed out due to the continuing insurgency in that region. The director chose to move the Kashmir segment to the Tatra Mountains in southern Poland, which also provides suitably snowy and mountainous terrain. It was filmed at certain historical locations in Delhi including the Red Fort, Jantar Mantar, Qutub Minar, Purana Qila and Lodhi Gardens.\\n\\nAamir Khan while promoting his film in Gujarat made some comments regarding the Gujarat chief minister's handling of the Narmada Dam and the necessity to rehabilitate the displaced villagers. These comments were met with outrage from political parties such as BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and the Indian National Congress.The government of Gujarat demanded an apology from Aamir Khan. Aamir Khan refused to apologize, saying \"I am saying exactly what the Supreme Court has said. I only asked for rehabilitation of poor farmers. I never spoke against the construction of the dam. I will not apologise for my comments on the issue.\" An unofficial ban of Fanaa was put in place for the entire state of Gujarat. Protests also occurred against the film and Aamir Khan which included the burning of posters of the star in effigy. As a result, several multiplex owners stated that they could not provide security to customers. Thus, most theater owners in Gujarat refused to screen the movie.\\n\\nProducer Aditya Chopra moved a petition to the Supreme Court of India asking them to direct the Gujarat government to provide protection to all cinema halls that wanted to screen the film, but it was rejected. Their response was that if a cinema was concerned for their protection they could call on the police.\\n\\nAddressing the media, director Kunal Kohli said, “All theatre owners or exhibitors who wish to release this film can request for protection and the government should extend support. We as filmmakers request all theatre owners of Gujarat to come forward and release the film. We have earned 47 Crores (both domestic and overseas) in the first week and have lost approximately 6 to 7 crores of business in Gujarat. However it's not about money... it is about a principle. As a democratic country where Aamir has a right to say what he feels, even the people of Gujarat, who are protesting have the right to say what they feel ... but in a democratic fashion, and not by burning posters and threatening people.\"\\n\\nA single privately owned cinema in Jamnagar, Gujarat, screened the movie with police protection despite the threats. It ran for over a week before being withdrawn again following a self-immolation bid by a man protesting against the screening. The man, Pravin Joshi, entered the bathroom of the theatre during intermission of one of the screenings and set himself on fire. He suffered 85% burns and succumbed to his wounds 9 days later.\\n\\nThe music of Fanaa was composed by Jatin Lalit, with lyrics provided by Prasoon Joshi. Five songs are featured in the movie, while the soundtrack contains seven songs. This was the last movie for which Jatin-Lalit composed as a duo (they split afterwards).\\n\\nThe following are the details about every song of Fanaa:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fangyan", "body": "The Fāngyán (; literally meaning \"regional speech\"), edited by Yang Xiong, was the first Chinese dictionary of dialectal terms. The full title is Yóuxuān shǐzhĕ juédài yǔ shì biéguó fāngyán (輶軒使者絕代語釋別國方言) \"Local speeches of other countries in times immemorial explained by the Light-Carriage Messenger,\" which alludes to a Zhou Dynasty tradition of imperial emissaries who made annual surveys of regional vocabulary throughout China. Yang's preface explains that he spent 27 years collating and editing the Fangyan, which has some 9000 characters in 13 chapters (卷).\\n\\nFangyan definitions typically list regional synonyms. For instance, chapter 8, which catalogs animal names, gives regional words for hu (虎 \"tiger\") in Han times. \\n\\nComparative linguists have used dialect data from the Fangyan in reconstructing how Chinese was pronounced during the 1st century CE, which is an important diachronic stage between Old Chinese and Middle Chinese. In the above example, Serruys reconstructs \"tiger\" as Old Chinese *blxâg.\\n\\nThe Chinese word fangyan is a compound of fang 方 \"direction; locality; side; place; region; area\" and yan 言 \"speech; talk; language; word; saying\". Fangyan semantically ranges across \"language\", \"regional language\", \"variety\", and \"dialect\" in comparative linguistics terminology, which involve criteria of mutual intelligibility, vocabulary, idiom, and pronunciation. Chinese fangyan is usually, but problematically, translated as English \"dialect\". Regarding the differences between fangyan and dialect, Victor H. Mair says,Two English neologisms have been coined to remedy this mistranslation of fangyan. John DeFrancis (1984:57) suggests regionalect for the mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese, leaving dialect for the mutually intelligible sub-varieties. Mair (1991:7) suggests topolect, which is fully Greek in derivation and size-neutral in regard to the speech area. (The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language includes topolect). Although these fangyan distinctions may seem like pedantic hair-splitting, this word is crucial in some political, social, and linguistic arguments whether Spoken Chinese consists of \"dialects\" or \"languages\" (see Identification of the varieties of Chinese). Julie M. Groves (2008) analyzes attitudes among native speakers of Cantonese and Putonghua whether Standard Cantonese is a language or a dialect, or whether it in fact fits the concept of a 'topolect' better. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Farley Mowat", "body": "Farley McGill Mowat, OC (born May 12, 1921) is a conservationist and one of Canada's most widely-read authors.\\n\\nHis works have been translated into 52 languages and he has sold more than 14 million books. He achieved fame with the publication of his books on the Canadian North, such as People of the Deer (1952) and Never Cry Wolf (1963). The latter, an account of his experiences with wolves in the Arctic, was made into a film, released in 1983.\\n\\nMowat's advocacy for environmental causes and a writing style that \"never let[s] the facts get in the way of the truth,\" have earned him both praise and criticism: \"few readers remain neutral.\" Nevertheless, his influence is undeniable: Never Cry Wolf is credited with shifting the mythology and fear of wolves. His stories are fast-paced, gripping, personal, and conversational. Descriptions of Mowat refer to his \"commitment to ideals,\" \"poetic descriptions and vivid images,\" but also to his strong antipathies, which provoke \"ridicule, lampoons and, at times, evangelical condemnation.\"\\n\\nGreat grandnephew of Ontario premier Sir Oliver Mowat, Farley McGill Mowat was born on May 12, 1921, in Belleville, Ontario, Canada and grew up in Richmond Hill, Ontario where he attended Richmond Hill High School. His father, Angus Mowat, who fought at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, became a librarian and enjoyed minor success as a novelist. Farley began writing informally while his family lived in Windsor from 1930–1933.\\n\\nAt the height of the Great Depression, the family relocated to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. As a boy, Mowat was fascinated by nature and animals. With his dog, Mutt (the hero of The Dog Who Wouldn't Be, 1957), Mowat explored the Saskatchewan countryside. He also kept a rattlesnake, a gopher, two owls (Owls in the Family 1962), a Florida alligator, several cats, and hundreds of insects as pets. With some of his friends, Mowat created the Beaver Club of Amateur Naturalists and kept a museum in the Mowat basement, which included the joined skull of a two-headed calf, some stuffed birds and a bear cub. This museum eventually had to be moved after an invasion by moth and beetle.\\n\\nAt the age of 13, Mowat founded a nature newsletter, Nature Lore, and had a weekly column on birds in the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix. He used the money he gained from his writing to feed ducks and geese, who would have otherwise died because they did not migrate south for the winter. His friends were children at the Dundurn Indian Reserve. In 1936, at age 15, Mowat made his first trip to the Arctic with his great-uncle Frank, an ornithologist with the Royal Ontario Museum.\\n\\nDuring the Second World War, Mowat was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant into the Second Battalion, Hastings and Prince Edwards Regiment, affectionately known as the Hasty Ps. He went overseas as a reinforcement officer for that regiment, joining the Canadian Army in the United Kingdom. On July 10, 1943, he was a subaltern in command of a rifle platoon and participated in the initial landings of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.\\n\\nMowat served throughout the campaign as a platoon commander and moved to Italy in September 1943, seeing further combat until December 1943. During the Moro River Campaign, he suffered from battle stress, heightened after an incident on Christmas Day outside of Ortona, Italy when he was left weeping at the feet of an unconscious friend, Lt. Al Park, who had an enemy bullet in his head. He then accepted a job as Intelligence Officer at battalion headquarters, later moving to Brigade Headquarters. He stayed in Italy in the 1st Canadian Infantry Division for most of the war, eventually being promoted to the rank of captain.\\n\\nHe moved with the Division to Northwest Europe in early 1945. There, he worked as an intelligence agent in the Netherlands and went through enemy lines to start unofficial negotiations about food drops with General Blaskowitz. The food drops, under the codename Operation Manna, saved thousands of Dutch lives.\\n\\nHe also formed the 1st Canadian Army Museum Collection Team, according to his book My Father's Son, and arranged for the transport to Canada of several tons of German military equipment, including a V2 rocket and several armoured vehicles. (It is believed that some of these vehicles are on display today at the Canadian Forces Base Borden tank museum.)\\n\\nMowat was discharged at the conclusion of the Second World War in 1945 as a Captain, and was considered for promotion to Major, though he turned down the offer as it was incumbent on him volunteering to stay in the military until \"no longer needed\", which Mowat assumed to mean duty with the Canadian Army Occupation Force (CAOF) but might also have meant the conclusion of the war with Japan.\\n\\nReturning to Canada after the war, Mowat studied biology at the University of Toronto. During a field trip to Northern Canada, Mowat became outraged at the plight of the Ihalmiut, a Caribou Inuit band, which he attributed to misunderstanding by whites. His outrage led him to publish his first novel, People of the Deer (1952). This book made Mowat a literary celebrity and contributed to the shift in the Canadian government's Inuit policy: the government began shipping meat and dry goods to a people they previously denied existed.\\n\\nThis work was followed by a Governor General's Award-winning children's book, Lost in the Barrens (1956), which was about two teenagers one white, one Cree lost in the Arctic. The children are able to combine their skills to survive for part of the winter but, ultimately, they almost die before being saved by an Inuit boy whose knowledge of the Arctic supplements their skills.\\n\\nMowat followed up these works with a series of personal memoirs. The Regiment (1955) is a skillful and unusual for military regimental histories of that era highly readable account of the regiment he had served in during the Second World War. The Dog Who Wouldn't Be (1957) and Owls in the Family (1961) are humorous memoirs about his childhood.\\n\\nDuring this period, Mowat also wrote two non-fiction accounts of the exploits of salvage tugs belonging to Foundation Maritime. The first, The Grey Seas Under (1958), chronicles the career of the tug Foundation Franklin, and the second, The Serpent's Coil (1961), chronicles the rescue of the British freighter Leicester in the face of two hurricanes by the tugs Foundation Josephine and Foundation Lillian.\\n\\nIn 1963, Mowat wrote a possibly fictionalised account of his experiences in the Canadian Arctic with Arctic wolves entitled Never Cry Wolf, which is thought to have been instrumental in changing popular attitudes on the canids. The work and its claims have been criticised.\\n\\nMowat then went through a phase of being very interested in Viking voyages to Canada, which resulted in the books West-Viking (1965), a controversial and largely debunked analysis of the Norse sagas trying to pin their accounts to specific Canadian geography, and The Curse of the Viking Grave (1968).\\n\\nMowat then moved to Burgeo, Newfoundland, where he lived for 8 years. He published three books describing his evolving view of his Newfoundland neighbours: in The Rock Within the Sea (1968), he presents Newfoundlanders as a heroic people uncorrupted by modern technology; The Boat Who Wouldn't Float (1969) reflects his disillusionment with a few Newfoundlanders; and, completing his disillusionment, A Whale for the Killing (1972) presents the shooting of a trapped and doomed whale as an inhumane tragedy. He was also co-author for the 1981 film version with Peter Strauss and Richard Widmark.\\n\\nMowat published a denunciation of \"the destruction of animal life in the north Atlantic\" entitled Sea of Slaughter in 1984. In 1985, as a part of the promotional tour for this book, Mowat accepted an invitation to speak at a university in Chico, California. However, U.S. customs officials at Lester B. Pearson International Airport in Toronto denied Mowat entry to the United States. They wouldn't tell him why specifically, but did tell him that it was because of a security file about him that indicated he should be denied entry \"for violating any one of 33 statutes\" (which ranged from being a member of the Communist Party to being a member of several other radical groups). The result was a media circus, which brought worldwide attention to Mowat. The negative publicity eventually forced the Reagan Administration to decide that Mowat was free to visit the United States but Mowat declined on the basis that he thought to accept it would be undignifying as the allowance was valid for only one visit—his book tour. Mowat documented the reasons why he was refused entry to the United States in his 1985 book, My Discovery of America.\\n\\nThen, Mowat became very interested in Dian Fossey, the American ethologist who studied gorillas and was brutally murdered in Rwanda in 1985. Mowat published two books about Fossey: Virunga: The Passion of Dian Fossey (1987) and Woman in the Mists (1987) an allusion to Fossey's book Gorillas in the Mist (1983).\\n\\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Mowat's works have mainly consisted of recombinations of themes he had previously dealt with. He returns to his World War II military service in My Father's Son (1992), and to his childhood in Born Naked (1993). He returns to the Canadian Arctic in High Latitudes: An Arctic Journey (2002) (an account of a 1966 trek in northern Canada) and No Man's River (2004) (an account of an Arctic adventure he took amongst the Ihalmiut in 1947). In Rescue the Earth: Conversations (1990), Mowat continued his work as an environmental advocate. In The Farfarers (2000), Mowat returned to the theme of pre-Columbian interactions between Europe and North America. In Bay of Spirits: A Love Story (2006) he returns to stories from his travels to St. Pierre and the southwest coast of Newfoundland in the early 1960s. These events have already led to This Rock Within the Sea: A Heritage Lost (1968), The Boat Who Wouldn't Float (1969), and A Whale for the Killing (1972). However, the 2006 effort adds many new personal details as well as fresh accounts of sailing the southwest coast and meeting its inhabitants that were not included in the previous works from that time period in his life.\\n\\nHe and his wife Claire currently live in Port Hope, Ontario part of Northumberland County, Ontario. They spend their summers on a farm in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.\\n\\nThe Toronto Star has written that Mowat's memoirs are at least partially fictional. In a 1968 interview with CBC Radio, Farley admitted that he does not let the facts get in the way of the truth (Canada Reads). Once, when Mowat said that he had spent two summers and a winter studying wolves, the Toronto Star wrote that Mowat had only spent 90 hours studying the wolves. \\n\\nAn article by John Goddard in the May 1996 issue of Saturday Night lays out a somewhat more in-depth criticism of Farley's celebrated works, especially Never Cry Wolf. In his article, \"A Real Whopper,\" he repeatedly challenged Mowat's claim that the book was non-fictional. He wrote, \"As for the authenticity of his wolf story, he virtually abandoned his wolf-den observations after less than four weeks.\" Mowat denied Goddard's criticisms but allegedly did not refute specific accusations. Canadian Wildlife Federation official Frank Banfield, in a 1964 article published in the Canadian Field-Naturalist, compared Mowat's 1963 bestseller to Little Red Riding Hood, stating, \"I hope that readers of \"Never Cry Wolf\" will realize that both stories have about the same factual content.\" L. David Mech, a wolf expert, stated that Mowat is no scientist and that in all his studies, he had never encountered a wolf pack which primarily subsisted on small prey as shown in Mowat's book.\\n\\nDuncan Pryde, a Hudsons Bay Company trader who pioneered the linguistic study of Inuit languages, attacked Mowat's claim to have picked up the language quickly enough in two months to discuss detailed concepts such as shamanism, pointing out that the language is complex and required a year or more for Europeans to master the basics. Pryde said that when Mowat visited his post at Baker Lake in 1958 he only spoke a single word in the Inuit language.\\n\\nFarley Mowat was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society ship RV ''Farley Mowat'' was named in honour of him and he frequently visits it to assist its mission, and has also provided financial support to the group.\\n\\nOn June 8, 2010, it was announced that he would receive a star on Canada's Walk of Fame.\\n\\nMowat is a strong supporter of the Green Party of Canada and a close friend of leader Elizabeth May. The party sent a direct mail fundraising appeal in his name in June 2007. In 2007, Mowat became a Patron of the Nova Scotia Nature Trust by donating over  of his land in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia to the Nature Trust.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Farm cat", "body": "thumbArcheological evidence suggests that the original need to domesticate cats centered around the human need to safeguard grain stores from rodent pests.Today farm cats, also known as barn cats, are still common, and are cats kept primarily for the purpose of catching the smaller vermin found on farm and ranch, which would otherwise eat and/or contaminate the farmer's crops, especially grain or feed stocks. \\n\\nThough farm cats may have a more wild temperament than cats kept as pet, they may be treated as house cats or derive sustenance solely from their job of lowering the mouse and rat populations. In the latter case, lack of guaranteed food supply, and the necessity of physical exertion on their part, may tend to cause these cats to be much leaner than their domestic counterparts. \\n\\nOn dairy farms, barn cats are often rewarded in milk for their work at hunting vermin. Most drink milk from a pan or bowl, but some learn to take it from the fountain (where a farmhand squeezes the cow's teat, squirting milk over a short distance directly into the cat's mouth). \\n\\nIf the population of adult female farm cats is kept high enough (about 3-6 breeding females, depending on the location) their population can be self-sustaining for several years. The females will establish permanent homes in barns or other structures, especially if they are fed and sheltered there. Males will almost always leave permanently, only returning to mate. This can lead to inbreeding, as the male offspring return to impregnate their mothers.\\n\\nIn areas with high numbers of predators, barn cat populations often become extirpated. They can be eaten by raccoons, owls, coyotes, and other animals that prey on creatures of their size.\\n\\nIn the past, farmers would control their farm cat population by selling cats to scientific or medical organizations. Carolina Biological used to collect excess farm cats for sale as dissection specimens, but this practice has long been abandoned.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Farm team", "body": "In sport, a farm team, farm system, feeder team or nursery club, is generally a team or club whose role is to provide experience and training for young players, with an agreement that any successful players can move on to a higher level at a given point. This system can be implemented in many ways, both formally and informally.\\n\\nThe term is also used as a metaphor for any organization or activity that serves as a training ground for higher-level endeavors. For instance, sometimes business school are referred to as \"farm clubs\" for the world of business.\\n\\nIn the United States and Canada, Minor League Baseball teams operate under strict franchise contracts with their major league counterparts. Although the vast majority of such teams are privately owned and are therefore able to switch affiliation, players remain completely under the control of their affiliated Major League Baseball teams. Minor league teams are usually based in smaller cities and players are typically paid significantly less than their Major League counterparts.\\n\\nMost major league players start off their careers by working their way up the minor league system, from the lowest (R) to the highest (AAA) classification, with the rare exceptions usually being those players signed from Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. Jim Abbott, Al Kaline, and Dave Winfield are notable exceptions to this, however. This process is formally referred by most MLB teams as \"player development\". However, minor league affiliates are often informally referred to as \"farm teams\" and a major league player's misfortune of being sent back to the minors is sometimes described as being \"farmed out\".\\n\\nThe farm system as it is recognized today was invented by Branch Rickey who -– as field manager, general manager, and club president –- helped to build the St. Louis Cardinals dynasty during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. When Rickey joined the team in 1916, players were commonly purchased by major league teams from independent, high-level minor league clubs.\\n\\nRickey, a keen judge of talent, became frustrated when the players he had scouted at the A and AA levels were sold by those independent clubs to wealthier rivals such as the Chicago Cubs and the New York Giants. With the support of Cardinal owner Sam Breadon, Rickey devised a plan whereby St. Louis would purchase and control minor league teams from Class D to Class AA (the highest level at the time), thus allowing them to promote or demote players as they developed, and \"grow\" their own talent.\\n\\nThe talent pipeline began at tryout camps that St. Louis scouts conducted throughout the U.S. \"From quantity comes quality,\" Rickey once observed, and, during the 1930s, with as many as 40 owned or affiliated farm teams, the Cardinals controlled the destinies of hundreds of players each year. (The reserve clause then bound players to their teams in perpetuity.)\\n\\nThe Cardinals would win nine National League pennants and six World Series championships between 1926 and 1946, proving the effectiveness of the farm system concept. Indeed, the second club to fully embrace such a system, the New York Yankees, used it to sustain their dynasty from the mid-1930s through the middle of the 1960s. When Rickey moved to the Brooklyn Dodgers as president, general manager and part-owner in 1943, he proceeded to build a hugely successful farm system there as well. Moreover, the teams that ignored the farm system in the 1930s and early 1940s (such as the Philadelphia A's and Phillies and the Washington Senators) found themselves falling on hard times.\\n\\nThe existence of the minor league system is due in part to MLB's ability to include a reserve clause in its contracts with minor league players, which gives the major league team exclusive rights to a player even after the contract has expired. In a landmark 1922 Supreme Court decision, Federal Baseball Club v. National League, baseball was granted a special immunity from antitrust laws. Despite the advent of free agency in 1976, which led many to predict the demise of the farm system, it still remains a strong component of a winning baseball strategy.\\n\\nThe teams of the National Hockey League also have their own farm teams. They are primarily in the American Hockey League. For example, the Binghamton Senators are the farm team for the Ottawa Senators. However, many teams have additional affiliates in the ECHL.\\n\\nUnlike baseball, not all the players on the rosters of the minor league teams are owned by an NHL team. In fact, the majority only have a contract with their minor league team.\\n\\nIn many clubs, there will be internal feeder teams. These may be age restricted teams, such as an 'Under-18s' team, or an 'A team'. For example, in international association football, national teams also operate youth sides, - see England national under-21 football team, for example.\\n\\nIn many sports, these feeder teams will compete in their own leagues, though in some cases they compete with other 'full teams' at a lower level. In Spain, B-teams can compete in the lower leagues; Villarreal B (affiliated to Villarreal CF) currently competes in the Spanish Second Division, for example.\\n\\nIn some countries, such as New Zealand, major teams are organised as regional franchises, and local club sides within these regions become automatic feeder clubs for these regional teams.\\n\\nIt is also getting more common for football clubs to arrange formal deals with other clubs with which they originally had no connection. The feeder/parent club connection could have many functions, and be very beneficial both for the feeder and the parent club. For bigger clubs, it is common to arrange agreements with the minor clubs in the area. The smaller teams can provide the bigger team (the parent club) with young talents, and the mother club have an opportunity to send their young players away on loan to these teams.\\n\\nIn addition to local connection, it's also getting usual to have feeder clubs in other regions of the country or in other nations, in order to gain further knowledge. Prominent Europe clubs are often making intercontinental deals with other clubs for the same reason. AFC Ajax have for instance a connection with the South African team Ajax Cape Town, Manchester United have a connection with the Australian team Wollongong Wolves and the Belgian team Royal Antwerp, and Lithuania side FBK Kaunas have loaned many of their younger players out to their Scottish parent team Heart of Midlothian in the hope of securing them a deal at a bigger club in the future. Having a feeder club in wealthy countries, where football is gaining a gradually better reputation, has also proved to be very beneficial. Countries such as USA, Canada, Japan, China and South Korea are good examples. Alternatively, some clubs within the EU have used feeder teams to sign non-EU players and then naturalize them in an EU country, to overcome visa regulations.\\n\\nTraditionally, the NBA did not have a formal farm league. It mainly relies on the elite NCAA to produce NBA players, and thus the latter was often known as the \"feeders\". Since 2001, the NBA directly owns an entire farm league: the National Basketball Association Development League. The NBA D-League started with eight teams in the fall of 2001. In March 2005, NBA commissioner David Stern announced a plan to expand the NBA D-League to fifteen teams and develop it into a true minor league farm system, with each NBA D-League team affiliated with one or more NBA teams. Although the system has been run for a few years, most of the rookies in NBA are still drafted out from NCAA. At the conclusion of the 2008-09 NBA season, 20 percent of NBA players had spent time in the NBA D-League.\\n\\nThe National Football League, as of 2010, is the only one of the four major professional sports in the USA that does not have a farm system.\\n\\nIn the 1930s, the Chicago Bears and New York Giants owned teams in the American Association, which became the first true minor league in professional football. In the 1960s, several NFL teams had agreements with the Atlantic Coast Football League to use their teams as farm teams, though they were not owned by the NFL owners. The most recent official minor league, NFL Europe, was different from most other farm teams in that all prospects were pooled and dispersed among the six European teams, instead of having teams assigned to each other.\\n\\nMany players in the Canadian Football League and Arena Football League later advance to the NFL, but no farming contracts exist among any teams officially. During the mid-2000s, several NFL owners at least partially owned arena football teams, such as Jerry Jones (Dallas), Arthur Blank (Atlanta), Bud Adams (Tennessee), Tom Benson (New Orleans), and Pat Bowlen (Denver), but very rarely did they ever promote or demote any players between the AFL and NFL, due in part to significant differences in the playing schedules and the style of play between outdoor and indoor football. All of the NFL owners backed out of the league when it went bankrupt, was sold off and reorganized.\\n\\nSome sports allow the operation of independent feeder teams. In professional cycling, for example, feeder teams such as Vendée U and Trek Livestrong, act as a feeders for Bouygues Télécom and Team RadioShack respectivley, and compete at levels below the UCI ProTour. Most pro-cycling teams use this format.\\n\\nSuch agreements may be less formal; in English football, for example, the operation of an external feeder team is prohibited. However, casual relationships may exist between teams to allow a sharing larger clubs' resources with smaller clubs, in return for the smaller teams taking young players on loan. This allows both clubs to maintain separate identities, and to exit from the arrangement if necessary. Such an agreement exists between Preston North End and Holker Old Boys, for example . Alternatively, clubs may use teams playing abroad, particularly if they want to follow the progress of players who they cannot sign due to work permit regulations. Please see List of feeder teams in football for a comprehensive list.\\n\\nSince the debut of the United Football League in 2009, the UFL has acted as an unofficial feeder league to the NFL, benefiting from the fact that the UFL ends its season a month (two months beginning in 2011) before the end of the NFL regular season.\\n\\nProfessional wrestling utilizes a farm system that allows wrestlers to learn the craft and gain experience in smaller, often regional, promotions before they are \"called up\" to perform on a national stage. Generally called farm leagues or developmental territories, some of the more notable ones for World Wrestling Entertainment include Heartland Wrestling Association (late 1990s) - which was also a developmental territory for World Championship Wrestling, International Wrestling Association (1999–2001), Memphis Championship Wrestling (2000–2001), Deep South Wrestling (2005–2007), Florida Championship Wrestling (2007 - Current), Ohio Valley Wrestling (2000–2008). In addition, smaller companies such as Ring of Honor, or the now-defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling can act as unofficial feeder leagues, seasoning wrestlers until a larger company offers them a contract.\\n\\nFormula One teams often use the most promising drivers from divisions such as the GP2 Series and Formula 3000, with all of GP2's Champions going on to F1 (Pastor Maldonado has won the 2010 GP2 Series, but does not currently have a seat with a F1 team). Twelve drivers on the grid for 2010 have previously raced in GP2.\\n\\nPremier Arena Soccer League is a farm system for the Premier Arena Soccer League PRO League.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Faroese króna", "body": "The króna (plural: krónur) is the currency of the Faroe Islands. It is issued by the Danish National Bank. It is not an independent currency but a version of the Danish krone. Consequently, it does not have an ISO 4217 currency code. The ISO 4217 code for the Danish krone is DKK. The króna is subdivided into 100 oyru (singular oyra).\\n\\nWhen German forces occupied Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Danish krone was used in the Faroes. However, all exchange between the Faroes and Denmark halted as a result of the occupation, leaving one currency to develop in two markets independently of each other. On 31 May 1940, special Faroese banknotes were introduced. They consisted of Danish notes with a special stamp. These notes replaced unstamped Danish at par.\\n\\nFrom 14 October 1940, new banknotes were printed \"on behalf of the National Bank of Denmark\". The value of these new banknotes was the same as those already in use. On 18 December 1940, a Currency Central was established in order to monitor foreign trade and to secure the solvency of the Faroes. Currency Central was headed by a board of nine, the judge, who was chairman, one representative of Faroe Fish Export, one representative of the Faroese Merchants' Union, one representative of the bank Føroya Banki, one representative of the savings bank Føroya Sparikassi and four representatives of the Løgting.\\n\\nOn 18 December 1940, the Faroese Króna was pegged to the British pound at a rate of 22.4 krónur = 1 pound. This rate was officially accepted by the British government in a treaty titled \"Agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Administration of the Faroe Islands, for Regulating the Financial Relations between the United Kingdom and the Faroe Islands\" which came into force on 27 March 1941. At the same time, the Board of the Currency Central was reorganized to only three members, one representative of the British Government, one representative of the State (referring to the State of Denmark, meaning the County of Faroe), and one representative of the Løgting or the parliamentary National Board. In 1941, coins were struck in London for use on the Faroe Islands.\\n\\nAs of 12 April 1949, the Faroese króna was separated from the pound sterling and fixed to the Danish krone at parity. This arrangement is still in effect. Although Faroese banknotes were issued \"on behalf of the National Bank of Denmark\", the National Bank of Denmark does not claim any rights to Faroese banknotes issued prior to 1951.\\n\\nIn early August 2009, the Faroe Islands applied to introduce the euro.\\n\\nDanish krone are exchanged to Faroese krónur and vice versa by the National Bank of Denmark free of charge. While normal Danish bank notes are no longer intended as legal tender in the Faroes, they are accepted there in most situations. In Denmark proper, existence of the Faroese króna is poorly known, particularly the fact that it is officially the same currency as the Danish krone and that the notes can be exchanged by any Danish bank without charge. Consequently, very few Danish stores will accept Faroese notes. People travelling from the Faroes to Denmark are often advised to exchange their cash prior to embarking in order to prevent potential complications arising from this situation.\\n\\nThe Faroe Islands use standard Danish coinage, but the region has experienced a shortage of small currency on several occasions, leading to non-standard issues. \\n\\nDuring the late 19th century, German national C.F. Siemsen, a merchant conducting business in both the Faroe Islands and Iceland, issued his own private coinage. This issue is brass, one side carrying the inscription: CFS and the other side the denomination: 4 or 16 skilling in goods (). Due to a shortage of currency in 1929-33, two merchants issued their own coins as well; J.F. Kjølbro in Klaksvík and S.P. Petersens Eftf in Fuglafjørður. The Kjølbro issue is aluminium coins with denominations of 10, 25 and 50 øre, and 1, 2, 5, and 10 kroner. S.P. Petersens Eftf's issue was made of brass in denominations of 5, 10 and 25 øre, and 1, 2 and 5 kroner.\\n\\nthumbDuring World War II, the Faroe Islands were separated from Denmark proper due to the occupations by the United Kingdom and Germany respectively. In 1941, a set of coins (1, 2, 5, 10 and 25 øre) was minted in London to alleviate a shortage of small change. This issue was identical to the pre-war Danish coinage already circulating, but is easily identified: the coins minted in London were made of bronze and copper-nickel, while the comparable coins minted in Denmark in 1941 were made of aluminium and zinc (with one exception). In addition, the British made set lacks both the mark of the Royal Danish Mint (a small heart) and the initials of the engraver and the mint master in Copenhagen.\\n\\nIn 1940, Danish 5, 20, 50, 100 and 500 kroner notes were overstamped with Kun Gyldig paa Færøerne, Færø Amt, Juni 1940 (meaning Only valid on the Faroe Islands, Faroe County, June 1940) for issue on the Faroe Islands. Later that year, the Færø Amt issued distinct notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 100 kroner. From 1951, notes were issued with texts in Faroese. The 1 kroner note was not continued, with 50 krónur introduced in 1967, followed by 500 and 1000 krónur in 1978, 20 krónur in 1986 and 200 krónur in 2003. Between 2001 and 2005, a new banknote series with new security features was introduced to replace older notes. Denominations are 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 krónur.\\n\\nPostverk Føroya used to be the sole supplier of Faroese banknotes to collectors, but does not sell banknotes anymore.\\n\\nKrone\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fastball Special", "body": "right\\n\\nThe Fastball Special is a popular tag-team move in superhero fiction. In a Fastball Special, a hero with superhuman strength literally throws a (usually) willing partner toward a target. The maneuver first appeared in the Marvel Comics series Uncanny X-Men #100, when Wolverine had Colossus hurl him in a battle. It quickly became a favorite tactic of the two heroes. It has also since been used by many superheroes, some from companies other than Marvel.\\n\\nWhen executing the fastball special, Colossus, a large and very strong mutant, takes the much smaller Wolverine into his hands and hurls him forward, like a baseball pitcher would throw a fastball. As Colossus is one of the strongest mortal characters in Marvel Comics, this throw can be superhumanly far, on one occasion even having Wolverine reaching an aircraft in-flight. As a result, Wolverine can reach the target of an attack he may not be able to reach otherwise and do it much faster than he would if he ran there by himself. Furthermore, Wolverine's metal-laced skeleton and his healing factor means that he is usually not in any danger of being severely injured in the move, and quickly heals in the rare instances that he is injured. The fastball special was also used in Here Comes Tomorrow, with Beak using it to drop Wolverine from great height at great speed as opposed to throwing him.\\n\\nThe fastball move was revisited in a scene from the comic book series Astonishing X-Men written by Joss Whedon and drawn by John Cassaday. In the story, Colossus, who was believed to be deceased at the time, had just been discovered and released from imprisonment, and one of those responsible was escaping in an aircraft. Wolverine asked Colossus if he was capable of physical effort after his long imprisonment, and when Colossus replied that he was, Wolverine said, \"I have two words for you\". The next frame, a full two-page spread (seen in the picture), showed Wolverine in mid-air and Colossus far below in a \"follow-through\" position, obviously having just launched his teammate; no dialogue was used in this frame, the picture speaking for itself to readers familiar with the maneuver. The move was most recently used in Uncanny X-Men #500, when Emma Frost, who is running from a Sentinel, telepathically asks, \"Logan--Piotr--Where the hell are you?!\" with Wolverine replying telepathically: \"Right here babe, Flyin' to yer rescue\" with Colossus throwing Wolverine into a Sentinel in the format of a fastball special.\\n\\nIn the Free Comic Book Day 2009 comic The Avengers Wolverine used the Fastball Special with Luke Cage to defeat the frost god Ymir.\\n\\nIn Uncanny X-Men #137, during the battle with Dark Phoenix on Earth's moon, Wolverine grasped Colossus by his chest and hurled him at Phoenix due the moon's lower gravity. \\n\\nAnother scene involving Wolverine throwing Colossus occurred in Wolverine #176, in which Wolverine is (temporarily) killed and meets up with Colossus in the afterlife, where the duo are attacked by slain villains. Wolverine then promptly picks Colossus up; the confused Colossus asks, \"Didn't this used to go the other way around?\", to which Wolverine replies \"Haven't you learned to improvise since you died?\" before hurling Colossus at the angry mob.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fat Guy Stuck in Internet", "body": "Fat Guy Stuck in Internet is an American live-action science fiction comedy television series created by John Gemberling and Curtis Gwinn, which ran from 2007 - 2008 as part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim schedule.\\n\\nAn adaptation/remake of Gemberling and Gwinn's 2005 Channel 102 web series Gemberling, Fat Guy Stuck in Internet follows computer programmer Ken Gemberling (the titular \"Fat Guy\"), who is accidentally sucked into his computer and learns he is destined to save cyberspace from a variety of evils. After a pilot aired in May 2007, Adult Swim commissioned a full season of Fat Guy Stuck in Internet which lasted ten episodes, airing from June 2008 to August 2008. Following the run of its first season, the channel chose not to renew the show for a second, effectively cancelling the series.\\n\\nHotshot computer programmer Ken Gemberling is the top programmer at his company Ynopmoclive Interactive, but is also remarkably rude, selfish and arrogant. After dumping beer on his computer keyboard, Gemberling is inexplicably sucked into his computer, landing in the farthest reaches of the internet where he soon discovers that he is in fact \"The Chosen One\", prophesied to save cyberspace from a devastating virus known as the nanoplague. Joined by a pair of humanoid \"programs\" named Bit and Byte, Gemberling embarks on an epic adventure to save the internet, return home and unleash the hero within, all the while hunted through cyberspace by ruthless white trash bounty hunter Chains.\\n\\nFat Guy Stuck in Internet uses a mix of greenscreen effects, hard sets, miniatures, matte painting and computer animation to create the show's cyberspace environment, though carries over many of the intentionally low-budget props and special effects from the web series (e.g. broom handles being used as laser-shooting weapons, etc.).\\n\\nThe basic premise of Fat Guy Stuck in Internet is a parody of the film Tron, from which the series also borrows several visual elements. Gemberling and Gwinn have noted further parody and stylistic influence taken from The Matrix, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Stephen King, in particular his Dark Tower series.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nFat Guy Stuck in Internet first appeared as a 2005 web series created by Upright Citizens Brigade alumni John Gemberling and Curtis Gwinn, known as the comedy duo of The Cowboy & John. Originally titled Gemberling, the series followed the same storyline and major plot points of its television adaptation, featuring much of the same cast (with the notable exception of Katie Dippold in the role of Byte) though with a considerably lower budget and more profanity. Aired in five-minute episodes as part of Channel 102, Gemberling became Channel 102's longest-running original series, lasting a total of eight episodes including a 17-minute finale. The shorts also aired as part of Fuse TVs Munchies.\\n\\nIn January 2007, Cartoon Network announced that they had commissioned Gemberling and Gwinn to create a series based on Gemberling as part of the Adult Swim programming block. Adult Swim made the decision to rename the series as Fat Guy Stuck in Internet, a title which both creators disliked. The entirety of the series was filmed and produced inside of a warehouse in Bushwick, Brooklyn. On May 30, 2008, Gemberling and Gwinn premiered Fat Guy Stuck in Internet before a live audience at the Upright Citizens Brigade theatre in New York City.\\n\\nFat Guy Stuck in Internet received mixed reviews from viewers and critics. The A.V. Club, having reviewed every episode as part of their \"Adult Swim Sunday\" column, was one of the series' harsher critics, primarily criticizing the show's \"cheap\" writing, poor movie parodies and John Gemberling's \"smirking, mediocre\" performance. As the series progressed, however, the reception became a bit warmer, with later episodes being called \"not completely terrible\" and \"not entirely unpleasant\" to the final episode being described as \"going out with a bang\", the reviewer admitting \"for a couple minutes, I actually found myself engaged\". Time also looked positively on the series, noting the show \"delivers\", being \"striking-looking and even good-hearted in its own bizarre way\".\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fauvism", "body": "thumbFauvism is the style of les Fauves (French for \"the wild beasts\"), a short-lived and loose group of early twentieth-century Modern art whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong colour over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism. While Fauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1904–1908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were Henri Matisse and André Derain. \\n\\nBesides Matisse and Derain, other artists included Albert Marquet, Charles Camoin, Louis Valtat, the Belgian painter Henri Evenepoel, Maurice Marinot, Jean Puy, Maurice de Vlaminck, Henri Manguin, Raoul Dufy, Othon Friesz, Georges Rouault, the Dutch painter Kees van Dongen, the Swiss painter Alice Bailly, and Georges Braque (subsequently Picasso's partner in Cubism).\\n\\nThe paintings of the Fauves were characterised by seemingly wild brush work and strident colours, while their subject matter had a high degree of simplification and abstraction. Fauvism can be classified as an extreme development of Van Gogh's Post-Impressionism fused with the pointillism of Seurat and other Neo-Impressionist painters, in particular Paul Signac. Other key influences were Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin, whose employment of areas of saturated colour—notably in paintings from Tahiti—strongly influenced Derain's work at Collioure in 1905. In 1888 Gauguin had said to Paul Sérusier: Fauvism can also be seen as a mode of Expressionism.\\n\\nGustave Moreau was the movement's inspirational teacher; a controversial professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and a Symbolist painter, he taught Matisse, Marquet, Manguin, Rouault and Camoin during the 1890s, and was viewed by critics as the group's philosophical leader until Matisse was recognized as such in 1904. Moreau's broad-mindedness, originality and affirmation of the expressive potency of pure colour was inspirational for his students. Matisse said of him, \"He did not set us on the right roads, but off the roads. He disturbed our complacency.\" This source of empathy was taken away with Moreau's death in 1898, but the artists discovered other catalysts for their development.\\n\\nIn 1896, Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited the artist John Peter Russell on the island of Belle Île off Brittany. Russell was an Impressionist painter; Matisse had never previously seen an Impressionist work directly, and was so shocked at the style that he left after ten days, saying, \"I couldn't stand it any more.\" The next year he returned as Russell's student and abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright Impressionist colours, later stating, \"Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained colour theory to me.\" Russell had been a close friend of Vincent van Gogh and gave Matisse a Van Gogh drawing.\\n\\nthumbIn 1901, Maurice de Vlaminck encountered the work of Van Gogh for the first time at an exhibition, declaring soon after that he loved Van Gogh more than his own father; he started to work by squeezing paint directly onto the canvas from the tube.\\n\\nIn parallel with the artists' discovery of contemporary avant-garde art came an appreciation of pre-Renaissance French art, which was shown in a 1904 exhibition, French Primitives. Another aesthetic feeding into their work was African sculpture, which Vlaminck, Derain and Matisse were early collectors of.\\n\\nMany of the Fauve characteristics first cohered in Matisse's painting, Luxe, Calme et Volupté (\"Luxury, Calm and Pleasure\"), which he painted in the summer of 1904, whilst in Saint-Tropez with Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross.\\n\\nthumbthumbThe artists shared their first exhibition at the 1905 Salon d'Automne. The group gained their name, after critic Louis Vauxcelles described their show of work with the phrase \"Donatello au milieu des fauves!\" (\"Donatello among the wild beasts\"), contrasting the paintings with a Renaissance-type sculpture that shared the room with them. Henri Rousseau was not a Fauve, but his large jungle scene The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope was exhibited near Matisse's work and may have had an influence on the pejorative used. Vauxcelles' comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in Gil Blas, a daily newspaper, and passed into popular usage. The pictures gained considerable condemnation, such as \"A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public\" from the critic Camille Mauclair (1872–1945), but also some favourable attention. The painting that was singled out for attacks was Matisse's Woman with a Hat, which was bought by Gertrude and Leo Stein: this had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralisation from the bad reception of his work.\\n\\n*\\n\\n"}

The episode was written by Heather Lombard and Evan Gore and directed by Peter Avanzino and Carlos Baeza.The episode focuses on a delivery the Planet Express Crew must make to a robot planet named Chapek 9. The robot inhabitants hate all humans and Bender decides to join them because he is tired of robots being treated like second class citizens. The episode is a light-hearted satire on racism, an idea reinforced by the title, a reference to Public Enemy's 1990 album Fear of a Black Planet.\\n\\nWhile attending a New New York Yankees blernsball game at Madison Cube Garden, Leela explains to Fry that blernsball is a \"jazzed up\" version of baseball. Bender is offended that humans will not let robots compete. Hermes calls and tells the crew to report back to the office for a delivery mission. The delivery is to Chapek 9, a planet inhabited by human-hating robot separatists who kill humans on sight, so Bender is assigned the duty of delivering the package. Bender claims that it is a robot holiday, Robanukah, and refuses to work. Hermes, however, insists that Bender must go, on the grounds that Bender has already used up all his sick days.\\n\\nUpon arriving at the planet, a resentful Bender is lowered to the surface. Meanwhile Fry and Leela decide to throw a Robanukah party for Bender to show their appreciation. They receive a rushed message from Bender: the robot separatists found out he worked for humans, and he has been captured. In order to avoid being killed on sight, Fry and Leela disguise themselves as robots and infiltrate the robot society.\\n\\nAfter hiding out in a robot movie theater, Fry and Leela blend in with the crowd at the opening ceremonies of the daily human hunt. There they discover Bender is alive and playing the robots' prejudice for his own benefit, claiming he has killed a million billion humans on Earth.\\n\\nFry and Leela reunite with Bender in an abandoned robot porn shop, but he refuses to be rescued. Before Fry and Leela can leave, the other robots arrive, and the two are placed on trial for being human. They are immediately found guilty of the charge and are sentenced to a life of tedious robot-type labor. A trap door opens and they fall into a hidden room where they meet the five Robot Elders. The Robot Elders reveal that the trial was for entertainment and command Bender to kill Fry and Leela, but Bender refuses, stating that the pair are his friends, and that humans pose no threat to robots. The Robot Elders reveal that despite being aware of this, humans provide them with a useful scapegoat to distract the population from their actual problems: lug nut shortages and an incompetent government of corrupt Robot Elders.\\n\\nThe Robot Elders decide the three know too much and must be killed. Fry threatens to breathe fire on the robot elders, throwing them into a state of confusion. None of the elders can remember if humans can do that or if it was something they made up. The crew flees, pursued by a horde of robots. As the crew escapes on the winch, the robots stack on top of each other, keeping pace with the winch. Bender remembers that he never actually delivered the package, and puts it into the hands of the robot on top. The unbalanced tower topples to the ground. The package bursts open, showering the robots in much-needed lug nut. The robots then renounce their human-hating ways. The crew, headed back to Earth, celebrate Robanukah with Bender, who confesses the holiday is fictitious.\\n\\nChapek 9 is named after Karel Čapek, a Czech writer who coined the term \"robot\".\\n\\nThis episode features synthesized speech from the 1980's arcade game Berzerk, after Fry & Leela are discovered leaking 'coolant' behind Garbage Can 738. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fecal occult blood", "body": "Fecal occult blood (FOB) refers to blood in the feces that is not visibly apparent. A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) checks for hidden (occult) blood in the stool (feces). Newer tests look for globin, DNA, or other blood factors including transferrin, while conventional stool guaiac test look for heme.\\n\\nFecal occult blood testing (FOBT), as its name implies, aims to detect subtle blood loss in the gastrointestinal tract, anywhere from the mouth to the colon. Positive tests (\"positive stool\") may result from either upper gastrointestinal bleeding or lower gastrointestinal bleeding and warrant further investigation for peptic ulcer or a malignancy (such as colorectal cancer or gastric cancer). The test does not directly detect colon cancer but is often used in clinical screening for that disease, but it can also be used to look for active occult blood loss in anemia or when there are gastrointestinal symptoms.\\n\\nIn 2007 the nomenclature of overt, obscure and occult bleeding was clarified.\\n\\nThe different methods of testing for \"fecal occult blood\" as broadly considered actually test for particular components of blood or for aberrantly expressed cellular markers from the intestinal mucosa.\\n\\nThere are four methods in clinical use for testing for occult blood in feces. These look at different properties, such as heme, globin, and porphyrin in blood or at DNA from cellular material such as from lesions of the intestinal mucosa.\\n\\nAdditional methods of looking for occult blood are being explored, including transferrin dipstick and stool cytology.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe estimates for test performance characteristics are based on comparison with a variety of reference methods including 51-chromium studies, analytical recovery studies in spiked stool samples, analytical recovery after ingestion of autologous blood, rarer studies of carefully quantified blood instilled at bowel surgery  as well as other research approaches. Additionally, clinical studies look at variety of additional factors.\\n\\nIn healthy people about 0.5 to 1.5 ml of blood escapes blood vessels into the stool each day. Significant amounts of blood can be lost without producing visible blood in the stool, estimated as 200 ml in the stomach, 100 ml in the duodenum, and lesser amounts in the lower intestine. Tests for occult blood identify lesser blood loss.\\n\\n'''Stool guaiac test''' for fecal occult blood (gFOBT) sensitivity varies depending on the site of bleeding. Moderately sensitive gFOBT can pick up a daily blood loss of about 10 ml (about two teaspoonfuls), and higher sensitivity gFOBT can pick up lesser amounts, sometimes becoming positive at about 2 ml. The sensitivity of a single stool guaiac test to pick up bleeding has been quoted at 10 to 30%, but if a standard three tests are done as recommended the sensitivity rises to 92%. Further discussion of sensitivity and sensitivity issues that relate particularly to the guaiac method is found in the stool guaiac test article.\\n\\nFecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) picks up as little as 0.3 ml but because it does not detect occult blood from the stomach and upper small intestine the test threshold doesn't cause undue false positives from normal upper intestinal blood leakage and it is much more specific for bleeding from the colon or lower gastrointestinal tract. The detection rate of the test decreases if the time from sample collection to laboratory processing is delayed.\\n\\nFecal porphyrin quantification by HemoQuant can be false positive due to exogenous blood and various porphyrins. HemoQuant is the most sensitive test for upper gastrointestinal bleeding and therefore may be most appropriate fecal occult blood test to use in the evaluation of iron deficiency  Advised to stop red meat and aspirin for 3 days prior to specimen collection  False positives can occur with myoglobin, catalase, or protohemes and in certain types of porphyria\\n\\nThe DNA based PreGen-Plus was four times more sensitive than fecal blood testing, including detection of early stage disease, when treatment is most effective. Sensitivity increased to 51.6% compared to 12.9%.Additional clinical trials of the PreGen-Plus method are underway to more fully characterize its clinical performance. Expanding the range of DNA testing by looking at additional known genetic markers, such as CTNNB1, or by analyzing epigenetically methylated genes such as MLH1 which is very common in hyperplastic polyps (HP) with microsatellite instability (MSI) and in proximal colon tumours that have poorer differentiation, does not appear to appreciably increase the sensitivity of the method because CTNNB1 mutations are infrequent in sporadic colorectal cancer, and because BAT26 alterations and lack of MLH1 expression show a high degree of overlap.\\n\\nThe stool guaiac test for hidden (occult) blood in the stool can be done at home or in the doctor's office, or can be performed on samples submitted to a clinical laboratory. Testing kits are available at pharmacies in some countries without a prescription, or a health professional may order a testing kit for use at home. If a home fecal occult blood test detects blood in the stool it is recommended to see a health professional to arrange further testing.\\n\\nGastrointestinal bleeding has many potential sources, and positive results usually result in further testing for the bleeding site, usually looking for lower gastrointestinal bleeding before upper gastrointestinal bleeding causes unless there are other clinical clues. Colonoscopy is usually preferred to computerized tomographic colonography.\\n\\nAn estimated 1-5% of large tested populations have a positive fecal occult blood test. Of those, about 2-10% have cancer, while 20-30% have adenoma.\\n\\nA positive test can result from upper gastrointestinal bleeding or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The common causes are:\\n\\nIn the event of a positive fecal occult blood test, the next step in the workup is a form of visualization of the gastrointestinal tract by one of several means:\\n\\nAlthough red or black stools can be an indication of bleeding, a dark or black color can be due to black licorice, blueberries, iron supplements, lead, Pepto-bismol, and a red color can come from natural or artificial coloring such as red gelatin, popsicles, Kool-Aid, and large amounts of beets.\\n\\nScreening methods for colon cancer depend on detecting either precancerous changes such as certain kinds of polyps or on finding early and thus more treatable cancer. The extent to which screening procedures reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal cancer or mortality depends on the rate of precancerous and cancerous disease in that population. gFOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy screening have each shown benefit in randomized clinical trials. Evidence for other colon cancer screening tools such as iFOBT or colonoscopy is substantial and guidelines have been issued by several advisory groups but does not include randomized studies.\\n\\nGuaiac FOB testing of average risk populations may reduce the mortality associated with colon cancer by about 25%. It is not always cost effective to screen a large population. \\n\\nIf colon cancer is suspected in an individual (such as in someone with an unexplained anemia) fecal occult blood tests may not be clinically helpful. If a doctor suspects colon cancer, more rigorous investigation is necessary, whether or not the test is positive.\\n\\nThe 2009 recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) suggest that colon cancer screening modalities that are also directly preventive by removing precursor lesions should be given precedence, and prefer a colonoscopy every 10 years in average-risk individuals, beginning at age 50. The ACG suggests that cancer detection tests such as any type of FOB are an alternative that is less preferred and which should be offered to patients who decline colonoscopy or another cancer prevention test. However, two other recent guidelines, from the US Multisociety Task Force (MSTF) and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) while permitting immediate colonoscopy as an option, did not categorize it as preferred. The ACG and MSTF also included CT colonography every 5 years, and fecal DNA testing as considerations. All three recommendation panels recommended replacing any older low-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) with either newer high-sensitivity guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT). MSTF looked at 6 studies that compared high sensitivity gFOBT (Hemoccult SENSA) to FIT, and concluded that there were no clear difference in overall performance between these methods.\\n\\nIn colon cancer screening, using only one sample of feces collected by a doctor performing a digital rectal examination is strongly discouraged.\\n\\nAn extensive literature has examined the clinical value of FOBT in iron deficiency anemia.\\n\\nConditions such as ulcerative colitis or certain types of relapsing infectious diarrhea can vary in severity over time, and FOBT may assist in assessing the severity of the disease. Medications associated with gastrointestinal bleeding such as Bortezomib are sometimes monitored by FOBT.\\n\\nSeveral aspects of FOBT in alcoholism warrant further discussion.\\n\\nSeveral studies have reported clinical benefit from gFOBT testing including urology and gynecology clinics.\\n\\nSeveral studies have questioned the traditional Admission Screening Guaiac (ASG).  The utility of following stool guaiac in ICU settings is also questioned. \\n\\nThe use of tests for occult blood in disorders of the mouth, nasal passages, esophagus, lungs and stomach, while analogous to fecal testing, is often discouraged, due to technical considerations including poorly characterized test performance characteristics such as sensitivity, specificity, and analytical interference. However, chemical confirmation that coloration is due to blood rather than coffee, beets, medications, or food additives can be of significant clinical assistance.\\n\\nA related concept to colon cancer screening by FOBT, based on most neoplasms affecting the surface epithelium and losing small amounts of blood but no visible blood loss, is screening in populations at high risk for esophageal or gastric cancers by testing for blood by swallowing a small capsule that is recovered after 3 to 5 minutes by gentle retrieval by means of an attached nylon thread.\\n\\nRegulations from the Joint Commission may have unintentionally decreased digital rectal examination and FOBT in hospital settings such as Emergency Departments.\\n\\nGastrointestinal (GI) complaints and low intensity GI bleeding frequently occur in marathon runners. Strenuous exercise, particularly in elite athlete runners and less frequently in other exercise activities, can cause acute incapacitating gastrointestinal symptoms including heartburn, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding. Approximately one third of endurance runners experience transient but exercise limiting symptoms, and repetitive gastrointestinal bleeding occasionally causes iron deficiency and anaemia. Runners can sometimes experience significant symptoms including hematemesis. Exercise is associated with extensive changes in gastrointestinal (GI) tract physiology, including diversion of blood flow from the GI tract to muscle and lungs, decreased GI absorption and small intestinal motility, increased colonic transit, neuroimmunoendocrine changes in hormones and peptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin and peptide-histidine-methionine. Substantial changes occur in stress hormones including cortisol, in circulating concentrations and metabolic behavior of various leucocytes, and in immunoglobulin levels and major histocompatibility complex expression. Symptoms can be exacerbated by dehydration or by pre-exercise ingestion of certain foods and hypertonic liquids, and lessened by adequate training.\\n\\nIngestion of 800 mg of cimetidine 2 hr before running a marathon did not significantly affect the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms or occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Conversely, 800 mg of cimetidine 1 hr before the start and again at 50 miles of a 100-mile running race substantially decreased GI symptoms and postrace guaiac test positivity but did not affect race performance.\\n\\nAdditional studies have reviewed the effect of cimetidine and of PPI \\n\\nRole of endoscopy in marathon runners with positive FOBT \\n\\nThis is a different process than march hemoglobinuria.\\n\\nFeces\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Federal Trade Commission Building", "body": "thumbThe Federal Trade Commission Building is a federal building which serves as the headquarters of the Federal Trade Commission. Completed in 1938, the building was designated by Congress as a contributing structure to the Pennsylvania Avenue Historic Site in 1966, and it was subsequently listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\\n\\nIssues of antitrust legislation, tariff reduction, and tax reform dominated the 1912 presidential race, which culminated in the election of Woodrow Wilson as the twenty-eighth president of the United States. Honoring his campaign promises, Wilson signed the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914. The following year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) absorbed the duties of the Bureau of Corporations in the United States Department of Commerce. The FTC conducted investigations, published reports, and scrutinized industries such as meatpacking. It could challenge unfair competition and practices in trade and commerce.\\n\\nThe FTC occupied various sites in the District of Columbia during its early years. The Public Buildings Act of 1926 authorized Congress to fund the Federal Triangle project, a large-scale initiative to develop a 70-acre site between the White House and the U.S. Capitol with federal buildings executed in classical styles of architecture. At the urging of the American Institute of Architects, the U.S. Treasury Department turned over principal design responsibilities to private architects. Edward H. Bennett of the Chicago firm Bennett, Parsons and Frost oversaw the project and designed the final building, which would become the headquarters for the FTC.\\n\\nIn 1937, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt laid the building cornerstone with the silver trowel that George Washington used to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol in 1793. In his speech, Roosevelt expressed hope that the \"permanent home of the Federal Trade Commission stand for all time as a symbol of the purpose of the government to insist on a greater application of the golden rule to the conduct of corporation and business and enterprises in their relationship to the body politic.\"\\n\\nLocated at the eastern point of the Federal Triangle, it was originally called the Apex Building. Staff moved into the building on April 21, 1938. Over the years, the FTC's responsibilities expanded to include the enforcement of credit laws, oversight of the National Do Not Call Registry, and the development of policies concerning Internet fraud and privacy.\\n\\nThe Federal Trade Commission Building is designed in the Classical Revival style of architecture. It is a refined style that conveys the dignity and stability of the federal government, which was particularly important during the Great Depression. The buildings within the Federal Triangle were designed according to principles of the City Beautiful movement, which espoused the use of formal arrangements, axial streets, and monumental, classical public buildings in city planning. Earlier in his career, the FTC Building's architect, Edward H. Bennett, was an assistant to prominent architect and planner Daniel H. Burnham, a pioneer in city planning responsible for the layout of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, as well as designs for Chicago and San Francisco. Burnham’s influence is evident in Bennett's work on the FTC Building.\\n\\nBennett's design emphasizes the relationship between the building and its site. It is located on a triangular parcel of land bounded by Pennsylvania and Constitution avenues and Seventh Street, NW; the building has an essentially triangular footprint with a semicircular portico at one end. An interior courtyard provides natural light to interior offices. The building has undergone few changes since its construction.\\n\\nThe seven-story building sits on a simple base of Mount Airy granite. The walls above are clad in large, smooth blocks of Indiana limestone laid in a regular pattern. Bays on the midsection of each elevation are divided by pilasters (attached columns) or colonnades that form a loggia (open-air, arcaded space). The seventh story is slightly recessed. The portico is supported by Ionic columns. Aluminum window and door grilles accent the exterior. The low hipped roof is covered with red terra-cotta tiles.\\n\\nThe interior spaces are relatively restrained; only public spaces and hearing rooms are afforded a measure of distinction. Three lobbies on the first floor share similar features. Floors are covered with large, dark green terrazzo panels with black borders. Walls are clad in Neshobe gray marble with black marble on fluted pilasters, and plaster covers the ceiling and cornice. The FTC Building was one of the first federal buildings in Washington to have an integral air-conditioning system and a basement parking garage.\\n\\nAs part of the building plan, the Section of Painting and Sculpture oversaw the design and installation of several significant works of art. Two bas-relief medallions with eagles are located on the northwest corner elevation. Officials requested that the artist, Sidney Waugh, develop a fresh interpretation on the symbol, and the resulting design is highly stylized, relating well to the building's other modern works. Large aluminum entrance grilles function as doors on the Constitution Avenue elevation. Images on the grilles, which were designed by William McVey, portray a continuum of commerce-related transportation methods. Depictions include Christopher Columbus's 14th-century ships, an 18th-century merchant ship, 19th-century clipper ship, paddlewheel steamship, early 20th-century ocean liner, and seaplane. Above the grilles are rectangular panels that represent foreign trade, agriculture, shipping, and industry, each executed by a different artist.\\n\\nTwo nearly identical allegorical sculptural groups called Man Controlling Trade are located at the east ends of the two avenue elevations. Michael Lantz designed the sculptures in the Art Deco style. In each, a muscular man holds a rearing stallion, symbolizing the enormity of trade and the government in its role as enforcer. The sculptures have become the agency's informal logo.\\n\\nBuilding\\n\\n"}

It was published on November 30, 1787 under the pseudonym Publius, the name under which all the Federalist Papers were published. It addresses a major objection of the Anti-Federalists to the proposed United States Constitution: that the sheer size of the United States would make it impossible to govern justly as a single country. Madison touched on this issue in Federalist No. 10 and returns to it in this essay. No. 14 is titled, \"Objections to the Proposed Constitution From Extent of Territory Answered.\"\\n\\nWhile a democracy can cover only a small space, Republics may span over many provinces. This is because in a democracy, all people must gather into one place to vote. In a Republic the people elect representatives to vote. The greatest danger to a republic is to confuse it with a democracy. It is easier to be united to have to travel to a distant province to represent the people than for that person to be isolated and attacked from all sides. So if Americans do not fall for a democracy, a republic will provide for a strong union, additional states, and security.\\n\\n14\\n\\n"}

The smallest species is the sand cat, which may be less than  in length, while the largest is the jungle cat, which can reach . They inhabit a range of different habitats, from swampland to desert, and generally feed on small rodent, supplementing their diet with bird and other small animals, depending on their local environment.\\n\\nGenetic studies indicate that the genus Felis first evolved around eight to ten million years ago, probably in the Mediterranean region.\\n\\nThe genus Felis is currently considered to consist of six living species, although the domestic cat and Chinese mountain cat are sometimes considered subspecies of F. silvestris. \\n\\nThe classification of the cat family (Felidae) has seen many permutations over the years, and nearly all other species of the family were at one point placed in the genus Felis.\\n\\nleft\\n\\nFelis once contained most of the small cats, and at times contained a very large number of species.

Today, few of these subspecies are recognised as being distinct, while the majority of species of small cat have been separated off into their own genera, such as Leopardus and Puma.\\n\\nPallas's Cat has an especially complicated taxonomic history. The bloated genus was later split into many smaller genera, resulting in Pallas's Cat being reclassified as the only member of the genus Otocolobus.

Finally, recent research has shown Pallas's Cat to be closely related to both Felis and Prionailurus.

He started off as a supporting actor, e.g. as the Bailiff in the box-office hit Die Drei von der Tankstelle (1930), but had soon established himself in leading roles of minor movies. After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Jewish-born Bressart had to leave Germany and continued his career in German-speaking movies in Austria, where Jewish artists were still relatively safe. After no fewer than 30 films in eight years, he emigrated to the United States. \\n\\nOne of Bressart's former European colleagues was Joe Pasternak, now a successful Hollywood producer. Bressart's first American film was Three Smart Girls Grow Up (1939), a vehicle for Universal Pictures' top attraction, Deanna Durbin. Pasternak also selected the reliable Bressart to perform in a screen test opposite Pasternak's newest discovery, Gloria Jean. The influential German community in Hollywood helped to establish Bressart in America, as his earliest American movies were directed by Ernst Lubitsch, Henry Koster, and Wilhelm Thiele (director of Die Drei von der Tankstelle). \\n\\nBressart scored a great success in Lubitsch's Ninotchka, produced at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. MGM signed Bressart to a studio contract in 1939. Most of his MGM work consisted of featured roles in major films like Edison, the Man.\\n\\nHe combined his mildly inflected East European accent with a soft-spoken delivery to create kindly, friendly characters, as in Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be, in which he sensitively recites Shylock's famous \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" speech from The Merchant of Venice. Lubitsch also directed Bressart to similar effect in The Shop Around the Corner.\\n\\nBressart soon became a popular character actor in films like Blossoms in the Dust (1941), The Seventh Cross (1944), and Without Love (1945). Perhaps his largest role was in RKO Radio Pictures' \"B\" musical comedy Ding Dong Williams, filmed in 1945. Bressart, billed third, played the bemused supervisor of a movie studio's music department, and appeared in formal wear to conduct Chopin's \"Fantasie Impromptu.\"\\n\\nAfter almost 40 Hollywood pictures, Felix Bressart suddenly died of leukemia at the age of 57. His last film was My Friend Irma (1949), the movie version of a popular radio show. Bressart died during production, forcing the producers to finish the film with Hans Conried. In the final film, Conried speaks throughout, but Bressart is still seen in the long shots.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Felix culpa", "body": "Felix culpa is a Latin phrase that comes from the words Felix (meaning \"happy,\" \"lucky,\" or \"blessed\") and Culpa (meaning \"fault\" or \"fall\"), and in the Catholic tradition is most often translated \"happy fault.\"\\n\\nThe Latin expression felix culpa derives from St. Augustine’s famous allusion to one unfortunate event, the Fall of Man, Adam and Eve's fall and the loss of the Garden of Eden, known theologically as the source of original sin. The phrase is sung annually in the Exsultet of the Easter Vigil: \"O felix culpa quae talem et tantum meruit habere redemptorem,\" \"O happy fault that merited such and so great a Redeemer.\" The medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas cited this line when he explained how the principle that \"God allows evils to happen in order to bring a greater good therefrom\" underlies the causal relation between original sin and the Divine Redeemer's Incarnation, thus concluding that a higher state is not inhibited by sin. The Catholic saint Ambrose also speaks of the fortunate ruin of Adam in the Garden of Eden in that his sin brought more good to humanity than if he had stayed perfectly innocent.\\n\\nThe concept also comes up in Hebrew tradition in the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and is associated with God’s judgment. Although it is not a fall, the thinking goes that without their exile in the desert the Israelites would not have the joy of finding their promised land. With their suffering came the hope of victory and their life restored.\\n\\nIn a literary context, the term \"felix culpa\" can describe how a series of miserable events will eventually lead to a happier outcome. The theological concept is one of the underlying themes of Raphael Carter's science fiction novel The Fortunate Fall; the novel's title derives explicitly from the Latin phrase. It is also the theme of the fifteenth-century English text Adam lay ybounden, of unknown authorship, and it is used in various guises, such as \"Foenix culprit\" and \"phaymix cupplerts\" by James Joyce in Finnegans Wake.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fellows Morton and Clayton", "body": "thumbFellows Morton & Clayton Ltd was, for much of the early 20th century, the largest and best-known canal transportation company in England. The company was in existence from 1889 to 1947.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe company started in 1837 when James Fellows, an agent for a canal carrier, decided to start his own company. James was 32 and based in West Bromwich. His first boat was called \"Providence\". In January 1839 he was allowed toll credit on the Warwick and Napton Canal as his boats were working down to London so frequently. He expanded rapidly and moved his operation to Toll End in Tipton in 1841. His business was as a \"Railway & Canal Carrier\" even though his rail activities were minor. James died in 1854 aged 49, and his widow Eliza carried on the business until their son Joshua was old enough to be an official partner. By 1855 he was transporting 13,000 tons of iron castings between London and Birmingham each year.\\n\\nIn the late 1850s a new boat-building facility was built at Tipton and by the early 1860s the fleet had grown to some 50 boats. Long-distance carrying was the mainstay of the business during these early years.\\n\\nIn 1876 Frederick Morton brought with him investment capital to expand the business, and the company name was changed to Fellows Morton & Co. This new company continued to absorb smaller traders, so expanding with new boats and also with acquired vessels.\\n\\nIn 1888-1889 William Clayton of Saltley, who operated a special fleet of liquid cargo boats as well as traditional loads, became the third partner. William died before the companies merged formally but his son, Thomas, took his place. Fellows, Morton & Clayton Ltd. was formed on 3 July 1889.\\n\\nThe three managing directors appointed at the first meeting of the new company were Joshua Fellows, Frederick Morton and Thomas Clayton, on salaries of £600 (£ as of ),each. The new chairman of Fellows, Morton & Clayton Ltd was Alderman Reuben Farley the majority of shareholders being family members of the directors of the company.\\n\\nAt the time of formation the general cargo fleet amounted to some 11 steamers and around 112 butty boats. The tank boats were transferred to another new company which was called Thomas Clayton Limited of Oldbury.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe company's first results for the 18 months ending 30 June 1890 showed a net profit of £7,497 (£ as of ),. Trading had not been easy to start with - a dock strike in London had caused a serious financial loss and an epidemic of Russian influenza amongst the horses had caused many deaths. However, as there was new traffic, a new basin and headquarters were completed at Fazeley Street in Birmingham. The headquarters were by the builder, Edwin Shipway. Also the company had acquired the interests of a rival carrier, Fanshaw and Pinson. The capital then stood at £84,620 (£ as of ),; barges, boats and steamers were valued at £20,852 (£ as of ),and horses at £4,000 (£ as of ),.\\n\\nIn 1895, new offices, stables and warehouses were opened in Nottingham on Canal Street. The architect was William Dymock Pratt.\\n\\nBy 1898 the capital had increased to £95,060 (£ as of ),, and the business of the London and Birmingham Canal Carrying Company had been acquired.\\n\\nBy 1906, assets stood at £143,300. (£ as of ),\\n\\nIn 1935 a new large warehouse was constructed at the Birmingham depot by the architects Watson & Johnson.\\n\\nthumbIn the new boatyard at Fazeley Street they built five steel-plate steam-powered boats. After an initial period of use they were found unsatisfactory because of the excessive wear on the hull's steel.\\n\\nIn 1896 Fellows, Morton & Clayton Ltd tried iron in the construction of their boats. The boat had an elm bottom and iron sides. This proved much more effective and 3 of the 5 original steel steamers were rebuilt. \\n\\nBetween 1898 and 1899, 8 more iron composite steamers were produced from the Saltley dock and 9 more between 1905 and 1911.\\n\\nThe steamers were known as fly- or express-boats and kept mainly on main-line long-distance routes. On the timetable, a trip from London (City Road Basin) to Birmingham (Fazeley Street Depot) would take around 54 hours. It was a non-stop service and the crew of four would change shifts along the route. The main drawback was the lack of carrying space on the boat due to the size of the engine and boiler. The boats picked up coke at preset points along their routes.\\n\\nPresident survives and is kept at the Black Country Living Museum.\\n\\nIn 1906 an experiment was carried out on the steamer \"Vulcan\": a gas suction engine was fitted, which reduced the size of crew needed to run the boat and also reduced the fuel consumption, but the size of the installation was still an issue. In 1911 a rival carrier had tried a semi-diesel engine which had proved to be successful. Fellows, Morton & Clayton Ltd built a boat for testing this engine (a Swedish Bolinder single-cylinder direct-reversing engine from J. &amp; C.G. Bolinder of Stockholm) which was built with a similar hull to the steamers but with a shortened engine room. \"Linda\" became the first motor boat of the fleet. The new engine was a success and they immediately started building another nine. Due to the success of the new engine they converted all steamers to motor boats by 1927.\\n\\nFellows, Morton & Clayton Ltd had built mainly their own boats, the Uxbridge dock building wooden boats and Saltley building new and maintaining existing boats. In 1922 they approached W.J. Yarwood &amp; Sons of Northwich to make 12 motor boats. The first arrived in May 1923. They ordered 12 more from Yarwoods which were delivered hull-only starting in 1926.\\n\\nThe headquarters of the company was at Fazeley Street in Birmingham. In addition to this, the company maintained depots at the following locations.\\n\\nThe first Fellows, Morton & Clayton Ltd livery was a combination of black & white with a red dividing line. Shortly after the company re-incorporated in 1921 the livery changed to red, green and yellow.\\n\\nIn the first 6 months of 1948 Fellows, Morton & Clayton Ltd incurred its first trading loss of £5,000 (£ as of ), and in November 1948 the company went into voluntary liquidation. The assets were taken over by the British Transport Commission on 1 January 1949.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fender Precision Bass", "body": "The Fender Precision Bass (often shortened to \"P Bass\") is an Electric bass.\\n\\nDesigned by Leo Fender as a prototype in 1950 and brought to market in 1951,  the Precision was the first bass to earn widespread attention and use. A revolutionary instrument for the time, the Precision Bass has made an immeasurable impact on the sound of popular music ever since.\\n\\nthumbAlthough the Precision was the first mass-produced and widely-used bass, it was not the first model of the instrument, as is sometimes believed. That distinction was claimed in the late 1930s by the Audiovox Manufacturing Company in Seattle, Washington.\\n\\nIn its stock configuration, the Precision Bass is an alder or ash-bodied solid body instrument equipped with a single split-coil humbucking pickup and a one-piece maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard and 20 frets. To this day, the Precision Bass is among the best-selling electric basses of all time.\\n\\nThe Standard P-Bass is sanded, painted and assembled in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico along with the other Standard Series guitars. As of December 5, 2008, the Standard P-Bass has been updated with CBS era-style decals, a 3-ply parchment pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard. Other features include a split-coil hum-cancelling pickup and a return to the knurled chrome flat-top control knobs. Models produced before 2003 came for a period with aged white Stratocaster control knobs.\\n\\nSince its introduction in 1992, the Standard Precision Bass used (like the rest of the Standard series instruments) a post-CBS era silver transitional decal. Fender changed the headstock decal to the bolder CBS-style in 2008.\\n\\nThe American Standard (featuring a high-mass vintage bridge and Hipshot lightweight staggered tuning machines), American Deluxe (featuring a J-style humbucking pickup in the bridge position and an active 3-band EQ with an 18V power supply), Highway One (featuring '70s styling, BadAss II bridges with grooved saddles and a Greasebucket tone circuit since 2006) and American Vintage series models are manufactured in Corona, California.American Deluxe \"Ash Body\" Precisions were offered from 1995 to 2006; the 2004 color chart listed Aged Cherry Sunburst, Butterscotch Blonde and Tobacco Sunburst as available finishes during that period. Fender discontinued the ash body option as of 2007. As of March 23, 2010, all American Deluxe Precision Basses came with a N3 stacked-coil Jazz Bass pickup in the bridge position, a 21-fret tinted maple neck with compound rosewood or maple fingerboard with white or black pearloid dot markers, an active/passive toggle switch, a high-mass vintage bridge, Hipshot lightweight vintage tuners, a stealth retainer bar for the A string and a bold CBS-era headstock decal.\\n\\nThe Road Worn Series 50s P-Bass (introduced in 2009) features a distressed alder body with nitrocellulose lacquer finish, a 1-ply gold anodized pickguard, a synthetic bone nut, American Vintage hardware, a split-coil humbucking pickup and a 1-piece maple neck/fingerboard with 20 vintage frets.\\n\\nSimilar to The Beatles and Yes' effect on the popularity of the Rickenbacker 4001, the early adoption of the electric bass was in part due to Bill Black's ownership of the instrument. Black was beginning to use a Precision Bass during the filming of Jailhouse Rock. Fender also delivered an early Precision to LA session bassist and arranger Shifty Henry.\\n\\nThe double bass was considered difficult to play in tune, physically cumbersome and difficult to transport. It was becoming hard to hear in increasingly large bands or in bands that included amplified electric guitar. With electric pickups, a small body and fretted neck, the Precision Bass overcame these problems. The name \"Precision\" came from the use of frets (as opposed to the fretless fingerboard of the double bass); players of the electric instruments could play in tune much more easily - they could play with \"precision.\"\\n\\nThe electric bass produces a timbre that differs from that of the double bass: it is a more focused, harder-edged sound, with less percussive thump and a more clearly articulated fundamental tone. By bringing the sound of the bass up in a band, the bass became more dominant in its role and transformed the beat and rhythm of pop music. The electric bass allowed driving rhythms while still outlining harmonic structures and is essential to the evolution from jump blues and swing to rhythm and blues and rock music, and today is still used regularly in any genre requiring the use of a string bass instrument .\\n\\nleftThe original Precision Bass of 1951 was essentially a bass counterpart to the six-string Telecaster and shared several of its design features—the main difference being its then-radical double cutaway body. In 1953 the Precision Bass received contoured edges for comfort while otherwise retaining the existing Telecaster-like styling.\\n\\nIn 1957 the Precision Bass received a major restyling; the headstock and pickguard were redesigned to closely resemble Fender's recently introduced, ultra-modern Stratocaster guitar, with a rounder neck heel replacing the original square shape introduced in 1951. The redesigned P-Bass pickguard was made of a single layer of gold anodized aluminum with 10 screwholes (1957–59) and then changed in 1960 to a 13-screw celluloid \"multilayer\" with 3 or 4 layers of black, white, mint green, aged white pearloid and brown tortoise shell. The original single-coil pickup was replaced in 1957 with a new split-coil pickup with staggered polepieces, connected in a humbucking mode; however, Fender never emphasized this, as the Seth Lover patent on the humbucking pickup had not yet expired. Two years later (1959), a rosewood fingerboard glued on a maple neck featuring \"clay\"-style dot position marker replaced the 1-piece maple neck. The rosewood neck became a standard feature until 1966/67, when the CBS-owned Fender companies began to offer a separate laminated maple fingerboard capped on a maple neck. Rosewood fingerboards were made of a veneered round-laminated piece of wood; pearloid dot markers replaced the \"clay\"-style inlays introduced in 1959. Since 1969, the 1-piece maple neck option is a standard feature on many Fender basses, with the rosewood fretboard offered as the second neck wood option.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the original Telecaster-derived design, with a few updates, was reintroduced in 1968 as the Telecaster Bass. Within a few years, however, it had evolved into a distinctly different model from the contemporary Precision Bass, and continued to be manufactured alongside the P Bass until the early '80s.right\\n\\nSome Precision Basses made in the 1970s were also available with an unlined fretless rosewood, ebony or (usually) maple fingerboard, popularized by endorsees Sting and Tony Franklin. Fender briefly offered a fretless P Bass in the mid-1990s as a part of the first-generation American Standard line, featuring a lined fretless rosewood fingerboard. The fretless American Standard P Bass left the Fender pricelist at the end of the 20th century. The American Series Precision Bass (introduced in 2000 and discontinued in 2008) sports the S-1 switching system since 2003, allowing the split-coil pickup to be wired from series to parallel, giving the bass a brighter, snappier tone similar to a Jazz Bass. This feature has been discontinued with the introduction of the second generation of American Standard Series instruments in 2008.\\n\\nFrom 1980 to 1984, the Precision Bass has been redesigned with new pickups, an active onboard circuit and a high-mass brass bridge. The range included the Special (1980) featuring a split-coil pickup with white covers, gold hardware and a 2-band EQ with an active/passive toggle switch and the Elite (1983) with one (Elite I) or two (Elite II) special-design split-coil humbucking pickups, TBX tone circuit and a fine-tuner bridge made by Schaller. Some models were available with a solid walnut body and a stained ebony fretboard. Japanese models appeared in late 1984, sporting the same specifications as their American counterparts, except for the addition of a downsized body shape and a modern C-shape maple neck with 22 medium-jumbo frets. The Elite Precision's Schaller fine-tuner bridge has been later used on the Plus Series models in the early 1990s.\\n\\nFender has also produced several 'Deluxe' or 'Special' models over the years which feature active electronics and/or a Jazz Bass pickup or humbucking soapbar at the bridge position in addition to the normal split-coil pickup. Both of these measures are designed to increase the tonal options available to a fairly simple bass. Some P-Basses with J-style bridge pickups usually feature the traditional Jazz Bass control layout of 2 volumes and master tone and a side-mount jack socket; others had the front pickup volume control moved a step forward, leaving much enough room for the top-mounted output jack. Other variants include dual stacked control knobs similar to that of an early 1960s Jazz Bass or a 3-way pickup selector switch (as used on the Tony Franklin Signature and Plus Series P-Basses).\\n\\nThe 1990s saw the introduction of the Precision Plus and Deluxe Plus basses in 1989 and 1991, featuring Lace Sensor pickups, fine-tuner bridges, 22-fret necks and passive or active electronics on certain models. The Custom Shop 40th Anniversary model of 1991 was a luxurious version of the Precision Plus Deluxe bass with gold hardware, a quilted maple top and an ebony fretboard with side dot position markers.\\n\\nOther variants (sometimes with 21 or 22 frets on the fingerboard) and special-edition Precision Bass guitars have been offered in recent years. Fender made an American Deluxe 5-string model with a split-coil neck pickup, a humbucking J-style bridge pickup and a 3-band active EQ between 2001 and 2007 and currently produces a passive American Standard with a high-mass vintage bridge and a gloss-coated maple neck with satin back and vintage tint as of 2008, tuned BEADG, along with a Squier Standard version sporting two J-Bass pickups with alnico magnets. The company has also built a Korean-made Squier ProTone 5-string Precision with dual humbuckers and gold hardware in the mid-1990s and a short-scale passive 5-string tuned EADGC called the Bass V during the CBS period in the mid-1960s. The Bass V did not sell well, and after it was discontinued, Fender did not offer another 5-string bass guitar until the 1980s.\\n\\nMany famous musicians have played Precision basses. Artists who are well known enough for using the instrument to have a signature Fender Precision bass model named for them include James Jamerson, Pino Palladino, Steve Harris, Tony Franklin, Duff McKagan, Matt Freeman, Mike Dirnt, Mark Hoppus, Sting, Pete Wentz, and Jason McCaslin.\\n\\nFor a more complete listing of players, please see List of Precision Bass players\\n\\nPrecision\\n\\n"}

He is best known for creating the first hybrid vehicle (gasoline-electric), the Volkswagen Beetle, the Mercedes-Benz SS/SSK, as well as the first of many Porsche automobiles. Porsche designed the 1923 Benz Tropfenwagen, which was the first race car with mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.\\n\\nHe made a number of contributions to advanced German tank designs: Tiger I, Tiger II, and the Elefant. As well as the Super-Heavy class Panzer VIII Maus tank, which was never put into production. In 1937, Porsche was awarded the German National Prize for Art and Science, one of the rarest decorations in Nazi Germany.\\n\\nIn 1996, Porsche was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame and in 1999 posthumously won the award of Car Engineer of the Century.\\n\\nFerdinand Porsche was born to German-speaking parents in Maffersdorf (), northern Bohemia, during the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today in the Czech Republic.\\n\\nHe showed high aptitude for mechanical work at a very young age. He managed to attend classes at the Imperial Technical School in Reichenberg at night while helping his father in his mechanical shop by day. Thanks to a referral, Porsche landed a job with the Béla Egger Electrical company in Vienna when he turned 18. In Vienna he would sneak into the local university whenever he could after work. Beyond auditing classes there, Porsche had never received any higher engineering education. During his five years with Béla Egger, Porsche first developed the electric hub motor.\\n\\nIn 1898, Porsche joined the Vienna-based factory Jakob Lohner & Co, that produced coaches for Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, as well as for the kings of England, Sweden, and Romania. Jakob Lohner had begun construction of automobiles in 1896 under Ludwig Lohner in the trans-Danubian suburb of Floridsdorf. \\n\\nTheir first design, unveiled in 1898, was the \"System Lohner-Porsche\", a carriage-like car driven by two electric motor, directly fitted within the front wheel hubs, and powered by batteries. This drive train construction was easily expanded to four-wheel drive, by simply mounting two more electric motors to the rear wheels as well, and indeed such a specimen was ordered by the Englishman E. W. Hart in 1900. In December that year, the car was presented at the Paris World Exhibition under the name Toujours-Contente. Even though this one-off vehicle had been commissioned for the purposes of racing and record-breaking, the 1,800 kg of lead acid batteries it required graphically illustrated the limits of this powertrain concept. Though it \"showed wonderful speed when it was allowed to sprint\", the weight of its huge battery pack meant that it was singularly reluctant to climb hills and suffered from limited range due to limited battery life. \\n\\nthumbStill employed by Lohner, Porsche reached the logical conclusion and in 1901 introduced the \"Mixte\" vehicle/transmission concept: instead of a massive battery-pack, an internal combustion engine built by the German firm, Daimler, was fitted to a generator to drive the electric hub motor and (for vehicle reliability) a small battery pack. This way Porsche had created the first petroleum electric hybrid vehicle on record, although since sufficiently reliable gears and couplings weren't available at the time, he chose to make it a series-hybrid, an arrangement currently more common in diesel-electric or turbo-electric railway locomotives than automobiles.\\n\\nThough over 300 Lohner-Porsche chassis were sold up to 1906, most of them were two-wheel drive—either front- or rear-wheel driven trucks, buses and fire-engines. No further four-wheel-drive passenger cars were manufactured, however some buses were fitted with it.\\n\\nThe up to 56 km/h (35 mph) fast carriages broke several Austrian speed records, and also won the Exelberg Rally in 1901 with Porsche himself piloting a front-wheel drive hybrid specimen. It was later upgraded with more powerful engines from Daimler and Panhard, which proved to be enough to post more speed records. In 1905, Porsche was recognized with the Poetting prize as Austria's most outstanding automotive engineer.\\n\\nIn 1902, he was drafted into military service. He served as a chauffeur to Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the crown prince of Austria whose assassination sparked World War I a mere decade later.\\n\\nIn 1906, Austro-Daimler recruited Porsche as their chief designer. Porsche's best known Austro-Daimler car was designed for the Prince Henry Trial in 1910, named after Wilhelm II's younger brother Prince Heinrich of Prussia. Examples of this streamlined, 85 horsepower (63 kW) car won the first three places, and the car is still better known by the nickname \"Prince Henry\" than by its model name \"Modell 27/80\".\\n\\nPorsche had advanced to Managing Director by 1916 and received the honorary doctorate degree, \"Dr. techn h.c.\" from the Vienna University of Technology in 1917 (hence the \"Dr. Ing h.c\" in his name, meaning \"Doktor Ingenieur Honoris Causa\"). Porsche successfully continued to construct racing cars, winning 43 out of 53 races with his 1922 design. In 1923, Porsche left Austro-Daimler after differences ensued about the future direction of car development.\\n\\nOnly a few months later Porsche landed a new job as Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft's Technical Director in Stuttgart, Weimar Germany, which was already then a major hub for the German automotive industry. He received another honorary doctorate from the Stuttgart Technical University for his work at Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft in Stuttgart and later the honorary title Professor. While at Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, he came up with several very successful race car designs. The heavy series of models equipped with superchargers that later culminated in the Mercedes-Benz SSK dominated its class of motor racing in the 1920s. \\n\\nIn 1926, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft and Benz &amp; Cie merged into Daimler-Benz, with their joint products beginning to be called, Mercedes-Benz. Porsche's concept of a small, light-weight Mercedes-Benz car was not popular with Daimler-Benz's board, however. He left in 1929 for Steyr Automobile, but the Great Depression brought about Steyr's economic collapse and Porsche ended up being unemployed.\\n\\nIn April 1931 Porsche founded his consulting firm, Dr. req. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH, Konstruktionen und Beratungen für Motoren und Fahrzeugbau, in Stuttgart, where he returned. With financial backing from the Austrian advocate Anton Piëch and Adolf Rosenberger, Porsche successfully recruited several old co-workers he befriended at his former places of employment including Karl Rabe, Erwin Komenda, Franz Xaver Reimspiess, and his son, Ferry Porsche.\\n\\nTheir first project was the design of a middle class car for Wanderer. Other commissioned designs followed. As the business grew, Porsche decided to work on his own design as well, which happened to be a reincarnation of the small car concept from his days at Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart. He financed the project with a loan on his life insurance. Later Zündapp decided to help sponsor the project, but lost interest after their success with motorcycles. NSU then took over the sponsorship, but also lost interest due to the high tooling costs.\\n\\nWith car commissions low in the depressed economic climate, Porsche founded a subsidiary company Hochleistungs Motor GmbH (High Efficiency Engines Ltd.) in 1932 to develop a racing car, for which he had no customer. Based on Max Wagner's mid-engined layout 1923 Benz Tropfenwagen, or \"Teardrop\" aerodynamic design; the experimental P-Wagen project racing car (P stood for Porsche), was designed according to the regulations of the 750 kg formula. The main regulation of this formula meant that the weight of the car without driver, fuel, oil, water and tire was not allowed to exceed 750 kg.\\n\\nIn 1932 Auto Union Gmbh was formed, comprising struggling auto manufacturers Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, Baron Klaus von Oertzen wanted a show piece project, so at fellow director Adolf Rosenberger's insistence, von Oertzen met with Porsche, who had done work for him before. At the 1933 Berlin Motor Show, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler announced two new programs:\\n\\nThe announcement lead to two projects for Porsche, and set a precedent for the rest of the decade with Porsche accepting further projects from Nazi Germany, latterly including military vehicles from the Panzer, Tiger Tank and the Elefant tank destroyer.\\n\\nthumbthumbIn June 1934, Porsche received a contract from Hitler to build three prototypes from designs Porsche already had, such as Porsche's 1931 Type 12 car. The three cars were completed in winter 1936. However, the original car designs follow from the innovative ideas of Hans Ledwinka, which resulted in a lawsuit by Tatra, against Porsche and his collaborators; settled by Volkswagen only several years after WWII. Daimler-Benz was contracted to build an additional 30 prototypes. A new city, \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\", near Fallersleben was founded for the factory. The city is named Wolfsburg today and is still the seat of Volkswagen.\\n\\nGerman racing driver Hans Stuck had met Hitler before he became Chancellor, and not being able to gain a seat at Mercedes, accepted the invitation of Rosenberger to join him, von Oertzen and Porsche in approaching the Chancellor. In a meeting in the Reich Chancellery, Hitler agreed with Porsche that for the glory of Germany, it would be better for two companies to develop the project, resulting in Hitler agreeing to split the money between Mercedes and Auto Union with 250,000 Reichsmark to each company. This highly annoyed Mercedes, who had already developed their Mercedes-Benz W125, and resulted in a heated exchange both on and off the racing track between the two companies for the period until World War Two.\\n\\nHaving garnered state funds, Auto Union bought Hochleistungs Motor GmbH and hence the P-Wagen Project for 75,000 Reichsmark, relocating the company to Chemnitz. As Porsche became more involved with the construction of the Wolfsburg factory, he handed over his racing projects to his son, Ferry. The dominance of the Silver Arrows of both brands was only stopped by the outbreak of World War II in 1939.\\n\\nIn November 1945 after the war, Porsche was asked to continue the design of the Volkswagen in France and to move the factory equipment there as part of war reparations. Differences within the French government and objections from the French automotive industry put a halt to this project before it had even begun. On 15 December 1945, French authorities arrested Porsche, Anton Piëch, and Ferry Porsche as war criminal. While Ferry was set free soon, Ferdinand and Anton were held in a Dijon prison for 20 months without trial. \\n\\nWhile his father was in captivity, Ferry tried to keep the company in business, and they also repaired cars, water pumps, and winch. A contract with Piero Dusio was completed for a Grand Prix motor racing car, the Type 360 Cisitalia. The innovative 4WD design never went into races, but the money it raised for Porsche was used to redeem Ferdinand Porsche from French prison. \\n\\nThe company also started work on a new design, the Porsche 356, the first car to carry the Porsche brand. The company was located in Gmünd in Carinthia at the time, to which they had evacuated from Stuttgart to avoid Allied bomb raids. The company started manufacturing the Porsche 356 in an old saw mill in Gmünd. They manufactured 49 cars, which were built entirely by manual labor.\\n\\nThe Porsche family returned to Stuttgart in 1949 not knowing how to restart their business. The banks would not give them credit, as the company's plant was still under American embargo and could not serve as collateral. So Ferry Porsche took one of the limited series 356 models from Gmünd and visited Volkswagen dealers to raise some orders. He asked the dealers to pay for the ordered cars in advance. He even wrote a letter to the bank's director to thank him for refusing. \\n\\nThe serial version made in Stuttgart had a steel body welded to the central-tube platform chassis instead of the aluminum body used in the small Gmünd-made series. When Ferry Porsche resurrected the company he counted on series production figures of about 1,500. More than 78,000 Porsche 356's were manufactured in the following 17 years.\\n\\nPorsche was later contracted by Volkswagen for additional consulting work and received a royalty on every Volkswagen Type I (Beetle) car manufactured. This provided Porsche with a comfortable financial situation as more than 20 million Type I were built.\\n\\nIn November 1950, Porsche visited the Wolfsburg Volkswagen factory for the first time since the end of World War II. Porsche spent his visit chatting with Volkswagen president Heinrich Nordhoff about the future of VW Beetle, which were already being produced in large numbers. \\n\\nA few weeks later, Porsche suffered a stroke. He did not fully recover, and died on 30 January 1951.\\n\\nIn 1996, Porsche was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame and in 1999 posthumously won the award of Car Engineer of the Century.\\n\\nIn 2010 an official memorial was erected in Porsche's birthplace in Vratislavice nad Nisou, Czech Republic, featuring Porsche 356.\\n\\nFerdinand\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fergal mac Máele Dúin", "body": "Fergal mac Máele Dúin (died 11 December 722) was High King of Ireland. Fergal belonged to the Cenél nEógain sept of the northern Uí Néill. He was the son of Máel Dúin mac Máele Fithrich (died 681), a King of Ailech, and great grandson of the high king Áed Uaridnach (died 612). He belonged to the Cenél maic Ercae branch of the Cenél nEógain and was King of Ailech from 700 to 722.\\n\\nAs King of Ailech Fergal participated in a victory over the men of Connacht in 707 where their king Indrechtach mac Dúnchado was slain. This was in revenge for the defeat and death of the high king Loingsech mac Óengusso in 703 at the Battle of Corann. Loingsech's son Fergal mac Loingsig was one of the participants.\\n\\nFergal became High King in 710, on the death of Congal Cendmagair of the Cenél Conaill. He ruled from 710 to 722.\\n\\nThe Cenél nEógain were expanding eastwards into Airgialla territory. In 711 he fought the Battle of Sliab Fuait (in the Fews, modern County Armagh) where the king of Uí Méith, Tnúthach son of Mochloinges, and Cú Raí mac Áedo of the Fir Cúl sept of the Síl nÁedo Sláine of Brega were slain. Hostility to the Síl nÁedo Sláine was evidenced by the expulsion of Fogartach mac Néill (died 724) from the kingship of Brega in 714 who went into exile in Britain. This appears to be the work of Fergalin conjunction with Murchad Midi (died 715) the King of Uisnech of Clann Cholmáin and Murchad may have been Fergal's deputy ruler in the south. \\n\\nFogartach's uncle Conall Grant (died 718) killed Murchad the following year and Fogartach returned in 716. In 717 Fogartach caused some manner of disturbance at the Óenach Tailten—an annual Uí Néill gathering held at Teltown—where two men were killed. Then in 718 Conall Grant won a victory over a coalition of southern Ui Neill kings at the Battle of Cenannas (near Kells) as part of the internal feuds of the Síl nÁedo Sláine. In frustration, Fergal intervened and had Conall killed two months later  This seems to have settled affairs among the southern Uí Néill.\\n\\nIn 719 Fergal began to impose his authority on Leinster and harrying expeditions are recorded. In 721 Cathal mac Finguine, king of Munster (died 742) and Murchad mac Brain Mut (died 727), king of Leinster attacked the lands of the southern Uí Néill and ravaged the plain of Brega. Later that year, Fergal retaliated against Leinster; he invaded and ravaged until the cattle-tribute was accepted and took hostages from the Laigin. A truce was made with Cathal as well. The Leinstermen broke the truce however, and Fergal retaliated by invading again in 722 with a large hosting of both northern and southern Uí Néill forces and their Airgíalla allies. However on 11 December 722 Fergal and numerous nobles of the Uí Néill were slain at the disastrous Battle of Allen (modern County Kildare) by the Leinstermen. The battle was preserved in the 10th century saga Cath Almaine. \\n\\nAccording to the saga Fáistine Fergaile meic Máele Dúin (\"Fergal mac Máele Dúin's Prophecy\") his son Áed Allán was born by a daughter of the high king Congal Cendmagair in an illicit union while the mother of his son Niall Frossach was of the Ciannachta. Both his sons Áed Allán and Niall Frossach were both later High Kings. Fergal was succeeded as High King by Fogartach mac Néill of the Síl nÁedo Sláine sept of the southern Uí Néill. His son Áed Allán succeeded him as King of Ailech and chief of the Cenél nEógain.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fermi surface", "body": "In condensed matter physics, the Fermi surface is an abstract boundary useful for predicting the thermal, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of metal, semimetal, and doped semiconductor. The shape of the Fermi surface is derived from the periodicity and symmetry of the crystalline lattice and from the occupation of electronic energy bands. The existence of a Fermi surface is a direct consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, which allows a maximum of one electron per quantum state.\\n\\nConsider a spinless ideal Fermi gas of  particles. According to Fermi-Dirac statistics, the mean occupation number of a state with energy  is given by\\n\\nwhere,\\n\\nSuppose we consider the limit . Then we have,\\n\\nBy the Pauli exclusion principle, no two particles can be in the same state. Therefore, in the state of lowest energy, the particles fill up all energy levels till , which is equivalent to saying that '' is the energy level below which there are exactly  states.\\n\\nIn momentum space, these particles fill up a sphere of radius , the surface of which is called the Fermi surface\\n\\nThe linear response of a metal to an electric, magnetic or thermal gradient is determined by the shape of the Fermi surface, because currents are due to changes in the occupancy of states near the Fermi energy. Free-electron Fermi surfaces are spheres of radius  determined by the valence electron concentration where  is the reduced Planck's constant. A material whose Fermi level falls in a gap between bands is an insulator or semiconductor depending on the size of the bandgap. When a material's Fermi level falls in a bandgap, there is no Fermi surface.\\n\\n[[Image:graphiteFS.png|thumb|A view of the graphite Fermi surface at the corner H points of theBrillouin zone showing the trigonal symmetry of the electron andhole pockets.]]\\n\\nMaterials with complex crystal structures can have quite intricate Fermi surfaces. The figure illustrates the anisotropic Fermi surface of graphite, which has both electron and hole pockets in its Fermi surface due to multiple bands crossing the Fermi energy along the  direction. Often in a metal the Fermi surface radius  is larger than the size of the first Brillouin zone which results in a portion of the Fermi surface lying in the second (or higher) zones. As with the band structure itself, the Fermi surface can be displayed in an extended-zone scheme where  is allowed to have arbitrarily large values or a reduced-zone scheme where wavevectors are shown modulo  (in the 1-dimensional case) where a is the lattice constant. In the three dimensional case the reduced zone scheme means that from any wavevector  there is an appropriate number of reciprocal lattice vectors  subtracted that the new  now is closer to the origin in -space than to any . Solids with a large density of states at the Fermi level become unstable at low temperatures and tend to form ground state where the condensation energy comes from opening a gap at the Fermi surface. Examples of such ground states are superconductor, ferromagnet, Jahn-Teller distortions and spin density wave.\\n\\nThe state occupancy of fermion like electrons is governed by Fermi-Dirac statistics so at finite temperatures the Fermi surface is accordingly broadened. In principle all fermion energy level populations are bound by a Fermi surface although the term is not generally used outside of condensed-matter physics.\\n\\nElectronic Fermi surfaces have been measured through observation of the oscillation of transport properties in magnetic fields , for example the de Haas-van Alphen effect (dHvA) and the Shubnikov-De Haas effect (SdH). The former is an oscillation in magnetic susceptibility and the latter in resistivity. The oscillations are periodic versus  and occur because of the quantization of energy levels in the plane perpendicular to a magnetic field, a phenomenon first predicted by Lev Landau. The new states are called Landau levels and are separated by an energy  where  is called the cyclotron frequency,  is the electronic charge,  is the electron effective mass and  is the speed of light. In a famous result, Lars Onsager proved that the period of oscillation  is related to the cross-section of the Fermi surface (typically given in ) perpendicular to the magnetic field direction  by the equation . Thus the determination of the periods of oscillation for various applied field directions allows mapping of the Fermi surface. \\n\\nObservation of the dHvA and SdH oscillations requires magnetic fields large enough that the circumference of the cyclotron orbit is smaller than a mean free path. Therefore dHvA and SdH experiments are usually performed at high-field facilities like the High Field Magnet Laboratory in Netherlands, Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in France, the Tsukuba Magnet Laboratory in Japan or the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in the United States.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe most direct experimental technique to resolve the electronic structure of crystals in the momentum-energy space (see reciprocal lattice), and, consequently, the Fermi surface, is the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). An example of the Fermi surface of superconducting cuprates measured by ARPES is shown in figure.\\n\\nWith positron annihilation the two photons carry the momentum of the electron away; as the momentum of a thermalized positron is negligible, in this way also information about the momentum distribution can be obtained. Because the positron can be polarized, also the momentum distribution for the two spin states in magnetized materials can be obtained. Another advantage with De Haas-Van Alphen-effect is that the technique can be applied to non-dilute alloys. In this way the first determination of a smeared Fermi surface in a 30% alloy was obtained in 1978.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fernando Rey", "body": "Fernando Casado Arambillet (September 20, 1917 – March 9, 1994) — best known as Fernando Rey — was a Spanish film, theatre, and TV actor, who worked in both Europe and the United States. A suave, international actor best known for his roles in the films of surrealist director Luis Buñuel (Tristana, 1970; Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, 1972; That Obscure Object of Desire, 1977) and as a drug lord in The French Connection (1971), he appeared in more than 150 films over half a century.\\n\\nThe debonair Rey was described by French Connection producer Philip D'Antoni as \"the last of the Continental guys\". He achieved his greatest notoriety after he turned 50: \"Perhaps it is a pity that my success came so late in life\", he told The Times of Madrid in 1973. \"It might have been better to have been successful while young, like El Cordobes in the bullring. Then your life is all before you to enjoy it.\"\\n\\nRey was born in La Coruña, Spain, the son of Captain Casado Veiga. He studied architecture, but the Spanish Civil War interrupted his university studies.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumbIn 1936, Rey began his career in movies as an extra, sometimes even getting credited. It was then that he chose his stage name, Fernando Rey. He kept his first name, but took his mother's second surname, Rey, a short surname with a clear meaning (\"Rey\" is Spanish for \"King\").\\n\\nIn 1944, his first speaking role was the Duke of Alba in José López Rubio's Eugenia de Montijo. Four years later, he acted the part of Felipe I el Hermoso, King of Spain, in the Spanish cinema blockbuster Locura de amor. \\n\\nThis was the start of a prolific career in movies (he played in around two hundred films), radio, theater, and television. Rey was also a great dubbing actor in Spanish television. His voice was considered intense and personal, and he became the narrator of important Spanish movies like Luis García Berlanga's Bienvenido Mr. Marshall (1953), Ladislao Vajda's Marcelino Pan y Vino (1955), and even the 1992 re-dubbed version of Orson Welles' Don Quixote. In fact, Rey acted in four different film versions of Don Quixote in different roles, if one counts the Welles version (for which Rey supplied offscreen narration in the final scene).\\n\\nHis brilliant performance in the role of a demotivated and doubtful actor in Juan Antonio Bardem's Cómicos (1954), while showing him for the first time in a successful lead part, paradoxically, as he saw himself as the real incarnation of the role, plunged him in a professional depression, of which he did not emerge until his collaboration with Luis Buñuel several years later. However, in the short term, Buñuel's disconcerting public remark on Rey's performance in other Bardem's film, Sonatas (1959), \"I love how this actor plays a corpse\", could only increase Rey's apprehensions; but anyway Rey became eventually Buñuel's preferred actor and closest friend.\\n\\nRey's first international performance was in The Night Heaven Fell (Les bijoutiers du clair de lune) a 1958 French-Italian film directed by Roger Vadim, where he shared cast with Stephen Boyd, Marina Vlady and the French sex symbol Brigitte Bardot. In 1959, he co-starred with Steve Reeves and Christine Kaufmann in the Italian sword and sandal film The Last Days of Pompeii.\\n\\nIn 1961 Rey played in the very first Spaghetti Western, The Savage Guns, and along that decade appeared in some other movies of this genre, including the political The Price of Power (1969) and two sequels of The Magnificent Seven, namely Return of the Seven (1966) and Guns of the Magnificent Seven (1969).\\n\\nIt was his work with Orson Welles and Luis Buñuel during the 1960s and 1970s that made Rey internationally prominent; becoming indeed the first 'international Spanish actor'. Rey starred in Buñuel's Viridiana (1961), Tristana (1970), The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie) (1972) (a surreal movie which received the 1972 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film) and That Obscure Object of Desire (1977). For Welles, Rey performed in two completed films, Chimes at Midnight (1966) and The Immortal Story (1968).\\n\\nRey played memorably the French villain Alain Charnier in William Friedkin's The French Connection (1971). Initially, Friedkin intended to cast Francisco Rabal as Charnier, but could not remember his name: he only knew it was a Spanish actor. Rey was hired before Friedkin could see him. Rey's English and French were not perfect, but Friedkin discovered that Rabal spoke neither of them, and opted to keep Rey, who reprised the role in the less successful sequel, French Connection II (1975).\\n\\nAlong 70s and 80s Rey played in many international co-productions of the most heterogeneous film genres, some of his appearances being almost just cameos. Among them, to name only a few, Lewis Gilbert's The Adventurers (1970), Mauro Bolognini's Fatti di gente per bene/Drama of the Rich (1974), Vincente Minelli's A Matter of Time (1976), Valerio Zurlini's The Desert of the Tartars (1976), Robert Altman's Quintet (1979), J. Lee Thompson's Cabo Blanco (1980) and Frank Perry's Monsignor (1982). But Rey's great success in that years indisputably was Elisa, vida mía, a 1977 Spanish drama film written and directed by Carlos Saura.\\n\\nOn his work in Stuart Rosenberg's Voyage of the Damned (1976), Rey once said: \"I played [Cuban] president Prío Socarrás; a cameo. They paid me a lot of money for less than six hours of shooting, in the Barcelona Stock Exchange building, with James Mason. I got more money than Orson Welles, who played a great role ...\" .\\n\\nIn later years Rey preferred to work in Spain, with successes as Francisco Regueiro's Padre Nuestro (1984), José Luis Cuerda's El bosque animado (1987) or Jaime de Armiñán's Al otro lado del túnel (1992), and above all his incarnation of Don Quixote, alongside Alfredo Landa as Sancho Panza, in the memorable Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón`s El Quijote de Miguel de Cervantes (1991) for the Spanish National TV.\\n\\nHis last appearance in the screens was in a supporting role in the Spanish black comedy El cianuro ... ¿sólo o con leche? (Cyanide ... pure or with milk?) (1994).\\n\\nIn 1971 Fernando Rey won the best actor award in the San Sebastián International Film Festival, for his performance in Rafael Gil's La duda, based, like Viridiana and Tristana, in a novel by Benito Pérez Galdós.\\n\\nAnother of the successes of Rey-Buñuel's tandem was That Obscure Object of Desire (1977), nominated for another Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe in the same category, though the movie failed to win either. Rey's voice had to be dubbed by Michel Piccoli.\\n\\nIn Lina Wertmüller's Academy Award-nominated film, Seven Beauties (1975), Rey played the role of Pedro the anarchist who, as a friend of the protagonist and fellow prisoner, Pasqualino Settebellezze, chooses a gruesome suicide rather than spend another day in a Nazi concentration camp.\\n\\nRey won Best Actor award at 1977 Cannes Film Festival by his performance in Elisa, vida mía. \\n\\nIn 1988 he won again the best actor award in the San Sebastián International Film Festival, this time for his performance in two films: Francisco Regueiro's Diario de invierno and Antonio Isasi-Isasmendi's El Aire de un Crimen (The Hint of a Crime). \\n\\nFernando Rey was awarded too with the gold medal of the Spanish Movie Arts and Sciences Academy.\\n\\nIn 1960, Rey married the Argentine actress Mabel Karr. In 1992 he became chairman of the Spanish Movie Arts and Sciences Academy. He died of cancer in Madrid in 1994.\\n\\n"}

It is usually available as the salt potassium ferrocyanide, which has the formula KFe(CN). \\n\\n[Fe(CN)] is a diamagnetic species, featuring low-spin iron(II) center in an octahedral ligand environment. Although many salts of cyanide are highly toxic, ferro- and ferricyanides are less toxic because they tend not to release free cyanide.Its most important reaction is its oxidation to ferricyanide:\\n\\nThis conversion can be followed spectroscopically at 535 nm with an absorption coefficient of 21600 M cm.\\n\\nTreatment of ferrocyanide with ferric-containing salts gives the intensely coloured pigment Prussian Blue.\\n\\nFerrocyanide and its oxidized product ferricyanide, [Fe(CN)], are impermeable to the plasma membrane. For this reason ferrocyanide has been used as a probe of extracellular electron receptor in the study of redox reaction in cells. Ferricyanide is used thus any increase in ferrocyanide can be attributed to secretions of reductants or \"Trans Plasma Membrane Electron Transport\" (TPMET) activity. \\n\\nAccording to the recommendations of IUPAC, ferrocyanide should be called \"hexacyanoferrate(II).\"\\n\\n"}

Ferroelectric devices are used in digital electronics as part of ferroelectric RAM, or in analog electronics as tunable capacitors (varactors).\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIn memory applications, the stored value of a ferroelectric capacitor is read by applying an electric field. The amount of charge needed to flip the memory cell to the opposite state is measured and the previous state of the cell is revealed. This means that the read operation destroys the memory cell state, and has to be followed by a corresponding write operation, in order to write the bit back. This makes it similar to the ferrite core memory. The requirement for a write cycle for each read cycle, together with the high but not infinite write cycle limit, poses a potential problem for some special applications.\\n\\nIn a short-circuited ferroelectric capacitor with a metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) structure, a charge distribution of screening charges forms at the metal-ferroelectric interface so as to screen the electric displacement of the ferroelectric.

The Doge Alvise I Mocenigo promised to build a magnificent church if the plague ended. Andrea Palladio was commissioned, assisted by Da Ponte, to build a majestic church on the Island of Giudecca. The church, known as Il Redentore, was consecrated in 1592, and is one of the most important examples of Palladian religious architecture. After the foundation stone was laid, a small wooden church was temporarily built, along with temporary bridge of barges from the Zattere, so that the Doge Sebastian Venier could walk in procession as far as the tabernacle. Afterwards, the Doge made a pilgrimage to the Church of Redentore every year. \\n\\nOn Saturday, the eve of the festival, fireworks are let off. Preparations begin early in the morning when people begin to decorate their boats, or the small wooden terraces on rooftops from where they can admire the fireworks. At sunset, Saint Mark's basin begins to fill with up with boats of all kinds, festooned with balloons and garlands, and thousands of Venetians await the fireworks while dining on the boats. Around 10 o'clock at night, from pontoons placed nearby the island of San Giorgio, the fireworks begin and Saint Mark's basin becomes one of the most atmospheric stages in the world. The fireworks last for around 45 to 60 minutes, illuminating the night and arousing intense emotions in both Venetians and visitors.

In fact, the only two countries described in the series are  and , whereas others are never depicted and seldom mentioned by name. At one point, Madlax's informant mentions that the civil war in Gazth-Sonika has started in 1999 and has been on-going for twelve years, so the story takes place approximately in 2011. \\n\\nNafrece is a tranquil Europe country apparently styled after France: for example, the Eiffel Tower that can be seen on multiple occasions, and in the official English translation (see Releases), the names of these two states are almost exact anagram of each other.

Bookwald officially invest into the world's key industries, but also covertly deals with weapons and is, in fact, a subsidiary of a powerful worldwide crime syndicate , that controls every information channel on the planet. The leader of Enfant apparently has supernatural powers: he is seen as able to erase a person's memory and alter their personality. \"Enfant\" means \"child\" in French, wherein this organization parallels a similar one in Noir, called \"Soldats\" (French for \"soldier\").\\n\\nEnfant's headquarters are located in Gazth-Sonika, a country in south-western Asia, that has been plagued for twelve years by a civil war between a Royalist faction and an armed religious group named . This country may have been inspired by or named after the Gaza Strip, since the syllables  in both  (gaza chiku, \"Gaza Strip\") and  are written with the same kana. Gazth-Sonika is geographically separated into two zones: the combat and demilitarized one, with the city of Daman in the latter being the only city explicitly named in the series  (it's unknown whether it has been inspired by Daman, India). The Nafrecian yur is used as a currency in Gazth-Sonika, as well, with 50 yur being considered a very large sum by the locals.\\n\\nThere are multiple general similarities between the real world and the fictional world of Madlax, as well, for example, the Darwin operating system  appears throughout the story and the cat statuette that Madlax keeps in her apartment  is a traditional Japanese good luck charm called Maneki Neko. Japan itself is mentioned early in the series, although it's the only real country to be so. Moreover, all firearm depicted in Madlax (as well as some vehicles, such as the light tank ERC 90 Sagaie) exist in the real world, for example, Madlax's favorite SIG 210-2 or Limelda Jorg's H&K PSG-1 sniper rifle.\\n\\nDue to the specifics of the genre, many terms and concepts remain unexplained even upon finishing the series, so the audience has to guess their meaning and nature by their visible effects.\\n\\nright\\n\\n, ,  are the  written in the extinct language of  with the .

Trilogy ), making them first murder everyone they can (starting with their own relatives and friends) and then commit suicide. This effect has been explained so that a person in the trance is \"freed\" from moral and ethic restrictions of their upbringing and therefore genuinely enjoys acting cruel and inhumane, or \"naturally\", as Friday Monday firmly maintains. In rare cases, such as Eric Gillain and Madlax's, the Words of Saruon simply make a person remember once committed, but later selectively forgotten crimes that were so amoral that a mere memory of them can result in their suicide.\\n\\nThe only humans who didn't have the Gift but were able to resist the incantations throughout the series are Madlax, Elenore Baker, and Vanessa Rene, though the latter required Madlax's help.\\n\\nMadlaxMadlaxSetting\\n\\n"}

When production completed, the baseball diamond created for the movie was left behind. Most of the baseball field, including the diamond and the adjacent house, was on one farm owned by the Lansing family, but the left and center field were on an adjacent property owned by the Ameskamp family. The field was built on the two properties because the producers wanted the field in a location where sunset shots would be uninhibited.\\n\\nAfter filming was completed, the Lansing family kept their portion of the field intact, and added a small hut where visitors could buy souvenirs. The Ameskamp family returned their land to farming for a year, but then restored the remainder of the field and opened up their own souvenir stand. The two owners had operated separate tourist facilities, and had also been at odds regarding commercialization of the site.\\n\\nKeith Rahe, a neighboring farmer, put together a baseball team dubbed the \"Ghost Players\" to entertain the visitors at the field. The team's presence at the field on Sunday afternoons once a month attracted thousands of additional fans to the field. Unfortunately, the Lansings failed to support the Ghost Players and prohibited them from using their half of the field for their, \"Greatest Show on Dirt.\" In 1991 and 1992 the Upper Deck Company sponsored a celebrity game at the Field. Executive Producer Tony Loiacono, who later received the key to the city, brought Hall of Famers like Bob Gibson, Reggie Jackson and Bob Feller to take on Hollywood Stars like Kelsey Grammar and Meatloaf in a charity game. The two games raised over $100,000 for local charities.\\n\\nIn August 2007, Rita Ameskamp sold the land containing her portion of the baseball field to Don and Becky Lansing - the owners of the remainder of the field. As a result the movie site is now entirely owned by the Lansing family. In 2009, the Lansings canceled the 20 year Field of Dreams celebration because of the economy. They donated $5,000 to the local food pantry instead.\\n\\nOn May 13, 2010, the Lansings announced they are putting the farm used for the movie up for sale.\\n\\nThe stadium is 281 feet to left field, 314 to center and 262 to right field.

Only the property owned by the Ameskamp family was allowed to be used for this event; the Lansing property was closed to the public.

It describes origins of devils, the rise of the most powerful devil, Asmodeus, and the mystery of how he came to the Nine Hells of Baator in the first place.\\n\\nIt also describes in detail each layer of the Hells, such as their physical features, social structure, rulers, and even the personalities of those who rule over each layer respectively.\\n\\nThis chapter describes the economy and society of the devils in hell, their relationship with demons, their origins, and their soul harvesting of mortals.\\n\\nThis chapter describes the nine layers of hell; Avernus, Dis, Minauros, Phlegethos, Stygia, Malbolge, Maladomini, Cania, and Nessus.\\n\\nThe Hellbreaker specializes in infiltrating the strongholds of devils and relieving them of their treasures. They develop a number of techniques useful for combating the forces of hell. Hellbreakers are always chaotic-good, chaotic-neutral, or chaotic-evil and often start out as rogues or ninjas.\\n\\nHellfire warlocks belong to a secretive group of specialist warlocks who have mastered hellfire, a dangerous energy found only in hell. As warlocks begin this prestige class and advance in it, they attain greater options in the uses of hellfire.\\n\\nHellreavers are warriors who are outraged by the actions of devils and their abilities to corrupt and seduce without consequence. They become tremendously effective combatants against devils. Hellreavers are always good-aligned and often start out in a combat-oriented class such as a barbarian, paladin, fighter, ranger, or even as a cleric or monk.\\n\\nSoulguards are openly opposed to the practices of the devils and are especially outraged by their foul bargains with mortals and their stealing of souls. They go to great lengths to protect those beset by the power of the Baatezu. Soulguards are almost always paladins or clerics, but they can also be druids or favored souls. Soulguards always have the alignment of either Lawful-good or Lawful-neutral.\\n\\nThis chapter introduces new types of devils including Abishai, Amnizu, Assassin Devil (Dogai), Ayberobos Swarm, Harvester Devil (Falxugon), Hellfire Engine, Kalabon, Legion Devil (Merregon), Malebranche, Narzugon, Nupperibo, Orthon, Paeliryon, Pain Devil (Excruciarch), Pleasure Devil (Brachina), Spined Devil (Spinagon), Steel Devil (Bueroza), and Xerfilstyx\\n\\nThe lords of the nine layers of Hell are listed and described in this chapter. Each layer has an archdevil that rules it. The ruler of Avernus is Bel, the ruler of Dis is Dispater, the ruler of Minauros is Mammon, the ruler of Phlegethos is Belial and Fierna, the ruler of Stygia is Levistus, the ruler of Malbolge is Glasya, the ruler of Maladomini is Baalzebul, the ruler of Cania is Mephistopheles, and the ruler of Nessus is Asmodeus.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fiesta al noroeste", "body": "Fiesta al noroeste is a novel written by Ana Maria Matute and first published in 1952.\\n\\nDingo is a puppeteer who is travelling when he runs over a small child with his cart. He then goes to Artamila in order to find Juan Medinao, a prominent land-owner and childhood companion, and find the child's family. Juan is really rich, and when Dingo arrives a servant comes to get Juan. Then, there is a flashback of the childhood of Juan, when his father, aka Juan Padre, was abusive to him and had an affair with Salome, a woman in the town. Salome had Juan Padre's second child, Pablo Zacaro. Juan's mother died as a result of Juan Padre's actions towards her, and after her death, Juan Padre sent Juan away to boarding school because Juan reminds him of his mother. However, Juan wants to know his brother, so he returns home to Artamila. Then, the story returns to the present, where a priest and doctor have joined Juan and Dingo at the dead child's house. The doctor is always drunk (emborrachado). Then, Juan confesses to the priest that his whole life, he has been pride. The rest of the book is his confession (as a flashback).\\n\\nAlthough Juan was an awkward child with a large head, he and Dingo were friends. They became friends when they realized that both of their dads beat them. Pablo, on the other hand, was a stone-fox. Juan Padre was really rich, and when he died, he gave all his money and land to Juan. At one point, Dingo brings Juan to a puppet show in the town, and it scares Juan, but Dingo runs away with the puppet cart.\\n\\nPablo feels every man should construct his own house, but Juan owns all the land and refuses to let Pablo build there. The servants unite around Pablo against Juan, and Pablo runs away. After Pablo runs away, Juan realizes that he wants everyone to know that they are brothers, so he asks Salome where Pablo went. Unfortunately, Salome doesn't know, but Pablo returns to the town with a girlfriend Delia, a peasant woman. Juan goes to Delia's family and asks for her hand in marriage, but she doesn't want to marry him. However, her family forces her to marry Juan so that she won't have to work anymore. After this, Pablo hates Juan and never wants to be with him. He also rejects Delia.\\n\\nThe flashback ends here and Juan's confession is over. The last chapter of the book is the dead child's funeral.\\n\\nThe main theme is pride. The pride of Juan prohibited his happiness. At the end of the novel, Juan Medinao wanted to be with his brother, but becausue he told Pablo that he couldn't build a house on his land, their relationship is ruined. The pride also effected Pablo because he was too prideful to accept Delia after her marriage to Juan.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fifinella (horse)", "body": "Fifinella (1913-?) was a British Thoroughbred who is the last racehorse to ever win both the Epsom Derby and Epsom Oaks and the last filly to ever win the Derby.\\n\\nBred and raced by Sir Edward Hulton, Fifinella was a daughter of Champion Sire Polymelus and out of the mare, Silver Fowl. Conditioned by Dick Dawson, on the track at age two the frequently raucous Fifinella won two races including the important Cheveley Park Stakes under jockey Steve Donoghue.\\n\\nAs a three-year-old, Fifinella was ridden by Joe Childs. Racing against mostly colt, after acting up at the starting gate, Fifinella finished second by a neck in the 1916 1,000 Guineas. However, the \"flying\" filly came back to win England's most prestigious race, the Epsom Derby followed by the country's most prestigious race for females, the Epsom Oaks.\\n\\nRetired at the end of the 1916 season, Fifinella met with only modest success as a broodmare. The most notable of the eight race winners she produced was the colt Press Gang (b. 1927) who won the juvenile Middle Park and Rous Memorial Stakes and at age three the Princess of Wales and Gordon Stakes. \\n\\nAuthor Roald Dahl, born the year of Fifinella's great racing successes, used her name for his female characters in his 1943 book, The Gremlins.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fifth (chord)", "body": "thumbthumbthumb\\n\\nIn music, the fifth factor of a chord is the note or pitch five scale degrees above the root or tonal center. When the fifth is the bass note, or lowest note, of the expressed chord, the chord is in second inversion .\\n\\nConventionally, the fifth is second in importance to the root, with second inversion being the strongest and the fifth perfect in all primary triad (I, IV, V and i, iv, v). In jazz chord and theory however, the fifth is often omitted, or assumed, in preference for the chord quality determining third and chord extensions and additions.\\n\\nThe fifth in a major and minor chord is perfect (G in C). When the fifth of a major chord is raised it is an augmented chord (G in C) . When the fifth of a minor chord is lowered it is a diminished chord (G in C) .\\n\\nThe open fifth and power chord consists of only the root, fifth and their octave doubling.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fighter Interception Unit", "body": "The Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) was a special fighter unit of the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. It was part of Air Defence of Great Britain\\n\\nThe Fighter Interception Unit was initially set up to counter increasing night raids by the Luftwaffe, and thus to evaluate technological advances such as airborne interception (radar) equipment and other proposed operational innovations.\\n\\nThe unit was formed at RAF Tangmere in April 1940 under the command of Squadron Leader George Philip (known as Peter) Chamberlain, with a strength of 5 Blenheims equipped with A.I.Mark III, the latest variant of Airborne Interception (A.I.) radar.\\n\\nOperations initially consisted of daytime practice interceptions and operational night defence flights. The night fighter Blenheims were directed several times to possible targets, in the early days of Ground-controlled interception (GCI) it proved difficult to both acquire and then maintain a radar contact and successfully intercept.\\n\\nHowever on the night of the 22/23 July 1940 a Blenheim Mk. IF flown by Flying Officer Ashfield, with a crew of Pilot Officer C. Morris (Observer) and Sergeant R.A. Leyland (AI Operator), patrolled the Sussex coast at 10,000 feet. They were directed to a possible intercept by the controller at Poling CH radar station who reported an incoming raid. Sgt. Leyland reported a response on the A.I. at a range of 8,000 feet and presently P/O Morris made a visual sighting of a Dornier Do 17 to port and below the Blenheim. Ashfield closed the distance to 400 feet and then opened fire.Strikes were observed on fuselage and engines, the Dornier lurched to starboard and fell away, 5 miles south of Bognor Regis. The aircraft, a Dornier 17Z of 2 Staffel, Kampfgeschwader 3, crashed into the sea, the first airborne radar intercepted kill in history.\\n\\nThe unit was also later equipped with the Hawker Hurricane and the Bristol Beaufighter while at RAF Tangmere\\n\\nBetween 1940 and June 1944, some 21 victories were claimed by the FIU.\\n\\nA FIU detachment was at RAF Newchurch to compliment the already formed 150 Wing with the Hawker Tempest V, where it tested the AN/APS 13 range-determining radar for night fighting use. This special flight of Tempest V's were formed to develop counter measures to the V-1 Flying Bomb which had begun falling on South-East England. This flight operated mainly by night, and claimed 86 ½ V1's destroyed before being absorbed into No 501 Squadron. The FIU's Squadron Leader Joseph Berry claimed 52 V-1's to become the RAF's top scorer against the flying bombs.\\n\\nOn 23 August 1944 the FIU became the 'Fighter Interception Development Squadron' (FIDS).By the latter war years the main element of the unit had become the 'Night Fighter Development Wing' (NFDW) -comprising the Bomber Support Development Unit (BSDU), the FIDS, and the 'Fighter Experimental Flight' (FEF), the latter specialising in day 'Ranger' operations by Mosquitoes.\\n\\nDuring the closing months of the war the BSDU claimed four victories, the FIDS two victories, and the FEF eight victories plus a large number of aircraft destroyed on the ground.\\n\\nIn late 1944 a radar-equipped Vickers Wellington was modified for use by the Fighter Interception Unit as one of the first Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft. It operated at an altitude of 4,000 feet over the North Sea to control Mosquito night fighters intercepting Heinkel He 111 flying from Dutch airbases and carrying out airborne launches of the V-1 flying bomb.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fighting Whites", "body": "rightThe Fighting Whites (alternatively identified as Fightin' Whites, Fighting Whities, or Fightin' Whities) were an intramural basketball team formed at the University of Northern Colorado in 2002 and named in response to the Native American mascot controversy.\\n\\nThe intramural college team briefly attracted a storm of national attention because of its satirical protest about stereotypes of Native Americans being used as sports mascot, particularly the \"Fightin' Reds\" of Eaton High School in Eaton, Colorado, not far from the university in Greeley. The Reds' mascot has been described as \"a caricature Indian with a misshapen nose, [wearing] a loincloth and eagle feather\". \\n\\nThe intramural team, which included players of Native American, white, and Latino ancestry, adopted the name \"Fighting Whites\", with an accompanying logo of a stereotypical \"white man\" in a suit, styled after advertising art of the 1950s, as their team mascot. The character has been described as a man from the Ozzie Nelson era or a \"'Father Knows Best' white American male\".\\n\\nAt first, the team's T-shirts used \"Fightin' Whites\" as the name of the team, but various media reports referred to the team as the \"Whities\" instead of \"Whites\". In response to customer demand, the team eventually began selling shirts under both names. The team added the phrase \"Fighting the use of Native American stereotypes\" to its merchandise to discourage the shirts from being worn by white supremacists, and arranged for CafePress.com to handle manufacturing and sales of the clothing.\\n\\nThe team sold enough shirts that they were eventually able to endow a sizeable scholarship fund for Native American students at UNC. In 2003, the team donated $100,000 to the University of Northern Colorado's UNC Foundation, which included $79,000 designated for the \"Fightin' Whites Minority Scholarship\". \\n\\n"}

Gammon.jpg", "body": "Staff Sergeant Archer T. “John” Gammon, a native of Virginia, was serving with Company A, 9th Armored Infantry Battalion, 6th Armored Division, near Bastogne, Belgium, on 11 January 1945. On that day, he charged through hip-deep snow to demolish an enemy machine gun position and allow his platoon to advance from an open field to nearby woods. As the platoon started its advance, a machine gun supported by riflemen and a Tiger Royal tank opened fire on the unit. Sgt. Gammon rushed forward; cut across the width of his platoon's skirmish line; then, despite intense enemy fire, charged and silenced the automatic weapon and attacked the enemy tank. Advancing to within 25 yards of his objective, he put the enemy on the defensive and forced the tank back a short distance before he was struck and killed by a direct hit from the tank's heavy gun. For his action in clearing the way for his platoon, Sgt. Gammon was awarded, posthumously, the Medal of Honor.Photo courtesy of Pittsylvania County, Virginiahttp://www.navsource.org/archives/09/13/130243.htm\\n\\n"}

The southern shaft of the compass rose arrow is at upper right.\\n\\nThe massive underground bunker for the two 16-inch guns of Battery Murphy is at center. It is oriented almost exactly north-south. The two gun positions are shown on the eastern side of the bunker, and its three drive-in truck entrances are on the western side. To orient the map, the coordinates of the center of the eastern edge of the concrete canopy covering Btty Murphy Gun 1 are ). The plotting room for this battery is shown at the center of a large mound of protective cover at the extreme western edge of the map, with two entrance portals opening towards Swallow Cave Rd. on its western side.\\n\\nThe twin 6-inch gun positions of Battery 206 are shown at lower left. Each gun position occupies a flat portion of seaside ledge, and they are joined by an underground central magazine bunker, which has portals to each side and a portal to the northwest, which was used to deliver ammunition to the bunker.\\n\\nThe two temporary Panama mounts for the 155mm guns are shown in the lower right-hand corner of the map. Today, only the remains of Gun 1 are visible at the surface, the mount for Gun 2 having been graded away during previous redevelopment of the Point.\\n\\nAlso visible, just south of 155mm Gun 1 and right at the water's edge, is the cable hut which served as the terminus for the Navy's underwater magnetic loop cable segments which were used to monitor the northern approaches to Boston Harbor and survives to the present. The structure to the southwest of this (marked \"Navy building [by others] on the map) was used to house the Navy personnel who monitored the magnetic loop detection system.\\n\\nToday, Northeastern University, which uses the former Btty Murphy bunker as a marine research facility, has administrative offices and classrooms (in a recycled 1950s Nike missile site building along the road on the west side of Btty Murphy, roughly in the area of the \"MESS HALL\" indicated on the 1945 map.\\n\\n"}

However, in most cases, scientific data resides in the class of \"factual material that has been discovered\" rather than creative works or matters of opinion. Generally in the US, factual content cannot be copyrighted, though the selection, arrangement, or style of presentation might be (e.g. Feist v. Rural). Since your intention is to take part of the data (presumably copyright exempt) and create a new image from it, you probably have nothing to worry about. Dragons flight 15:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)\"\\n\\n2. If you sketched that yourself (sketched, not traced), the formatting layout is probably too trivial to itself be copyrightable.

The shift operator  on the lattice has an action on the unit square with the following representation: \\n\\nThis map (up to a reflection/rotation around the 45-degree axis) is essentially the Baker's map or equivalently the Horseshoe map. As the article on the Horseshoe map explains, the invariant sets have such a tartan pattern (an appropriately deformed Sierpinski carpet). In this case, the invariance arises from the translation invariance of the Gibbs state of the Ising model: that is, the energy  associated with the state  is invariant under the action of :\\n\\nfor all integers . Similarly, the probability density is invariant as well:\\n\\nThe naive classical treatment given here suffers from conceptual difficulties in the  limit. These problems can be remedied by using a more appropriate topology on the set of states that make up the configuration space. This topology is the cylinder set topology, and using it allows one to construct a sigma algebra and thus a measure on the set of states. With this topology, the probability density can be understood to be a translation-invariant measure on the topology. Indeed, there is a certain sense in which the seemingly fractal patterns generated by the iterated Baker's map or horseshoe map can be understood with a conventional and well-behaved topology on a lattice model.\\n\\nCreated by Linas Vepstas  on 24 September 2006\\n\\n"}

Through education and research, it is contributing to Korean society by leading advancement in science and innovation in technology. To accomplish its mission of cultivation of talents with originality and application abilities, it merged with KIT in March of 1990. To increase the comfort of users, a contemporary 5 story building was constructed as the main library, and it is being operated with an annex library, effectively providing the most current information in the areas of science and technology. The library uses the American LC Classification Schedule, and by using the complete shelf system, library users are able to seek information themselves.\\n\\n"}

Because it is a logo there is no free equivalent, and the entire logo must be used to convey the meaning and avoid misrepresenting the company's corporate branding. As a logo it is significant because it helps the reader identify the company, assures the reader that they have reached the right article, and illustrates the company's intended branding message in a way that words alone could not convey. Care was taken to copy the logo in a size and resolution sufficient to maintain the quality intended by the company, without being overly high resolution. \\n\\n"}
