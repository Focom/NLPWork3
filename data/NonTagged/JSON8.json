{"title": "Electrical tuning", "body": "Electrical tuning is a mechanism by which vertebrate such as frog and reptile, which lack a long cochlea, discriminate sound. Mammal have long cochleae, and are able to distinguish different sounds by mechanisms such as mechanical tuning, in which the stiffness and length of hair cell’ stereocilia makes a given cell best suited to respond to a certain type of stimulus. The basilar membrane of animals with long cochleae also vibrates at different locations along the membrane in response to different frequency sounds. Since the reptilian ear lacks a long cochlea, electrical tuning provides an alternative mechanism for perceiving differences in sound.\\n\\nWith a combination of voltage-gated calcium channel and calcium sensitive K+ channel, the cell set up an oscillation in voltage and oscillate in response to a depolarizing stimulus. Ca enters the cell and depolarizes it, opening K channels which allow K to leave and hyperpolarize the cell. Since the exit of K from the cell is delayed, the voltage increases, but then with the exit of the K the cell overshoots the membrane potential and hyperpolarizes. Different cells have different delays for K leaving and thus the voltage oscillates at different frequencies. The delays can be as short as 0.7 ms or as long as 150 ms, whereas the Ca entry always occurs within about 1 ms (Fettiplace, 1987). Thus by varying the length of delay for K to leave, cells' ion concentration can oscillate at specific frequencies. Cells with higher oscillating frequencies respond best to higher-frequency sounds, while those with lower frequencies respond best to lower frequency ones. Which cells resonate best with a given sound tells the brain what the frequency of the sound is. Hair cells that respond to high frequency stimuli send information to specific neurons, and the information remains segregated in the brain. Thus, information about sound frequency is preserved, rather than being lost as it would if all information from different hair cells converged on the same neuron or group of neurons.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electron density", "body": "Electron density is the measure of the probability of an electron being present at a specific location.\\n\\nIn molecule, regions of electron density are usually found around the atom, and its bonds. In de-localized or conjugated system, such as phenol, benzene and compounds such as hemoglobin and chlorophyll, the electron density covers an entire region, i.e., in benzene they are found above and below the planar ring. This is sometimes shown diagrammatically as a series of alternating single and double bonds. In the case of phenol and benzene, a circle inside a hexagon shows the de-localized nature of the compound. This is shown below:\\n\\n503px\\n\\nIn compounds with multiple ring systems which are interconnected, this is no longer accurate, so alternating single and double bonds are used. In compounds such as chlorophyll and phenol, some diagrams show a dotted or dashed line to represent the de-localization of areas where the electron density is higher next to the single bonds . Conjugated systems can sometimes represent regions where electromagnetic radiation is absorbed at different wavelengths resulting in compounds appearing coloured. In polymer, these areas are known as chromophores.\\n\\nIn quantum chemical calculations, the electron density, ρ(r), is a function of the coordinates r, defined so ρ(r)dr is the number of electrons in a small volume dr. For closed-shell molecules, ρ(r) can be written in terms of a sum of products of basis functions, φ:center300px\\n\\nP is the density matrix. Electron densities are often be rendered in terms of an isosurface (an isodensity surface) with the size and shape of the surface determined by the value of the density chosen, or in terms of a percentage of total electrons enclosed.\\n\\nMolecular modeling software often provides graphical images of electron density. For example, in aniline (see image at right). Graphical models, including electron density are a commonly employed tool in chemistry education. Note in the left-most image of aniline, high electron densities are associated with the carbon and nitrogen, but the hydrogen with only one proton in their nuclei, are not visible. This is the reason that X-ray diffraction has a difficult time locating hydrogen positions.\\n\\nMost molecular modeling software packages allow the user to choose a value for the electron density, often called the IsoValue. Some software also allows for specification of the electron density in terms of percentage of total electrons enclosed. Depending on the IsoValue (typical units are electrons per cubic bohr), or the percentage of total electrons enclosed, the electron density surface can be used locate atoms, emphasize electron densities associated with chemical bond, or to indicate overall molecular size and shape.\\n\\nGraphically, the electron density surface also serves as a canvas upon which other electronic properties can be displayed. The electrostatic potential map (the property of electrostatic potential mapped upon the electron density) provides an indicator for charge distribution in a molecule. The local ionization potential map (the property of local ioniozation potential mapped upon the electron density) provides an indicator of electrophilicity. And the LUMO map (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital mapped upon the electron density) can provide an indicatory for nucleophilicity.\\n\\nElectron densities are often probed with X-ray diffraction scans, where X-rays of a suitable wavelength are targeted towards a sample and measurements are made over time to represent, probabilistically, where electrons can be found, from these positions molecular structures can often be determined for crystallized systems. Quantum electrodynamics and some branches of quantum theory also study and analyze electron superposition and other phenomena. Quantum tunneling and quantum entanglement are interesting areas involving electron (or photon). High speed electrons are often used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and deep inelastic scattering, as well as many other high-speed particle experiments involving electrons.\\n\\nMulliken population analysis is based on electron densities in molecules and is a way of dividing the density between atoms to give an estimate of atomic charges.\\n\\nSpin density is electron density applied to free radical. It is defined as the total electron density of electrons of one spin minus the total electron density of the electrons of the other spin. One of the ways to measure it experimentally is by electron spin resonance , neutron diffraction allows direct mapping of the spin density in 3D-space.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Electronic circuit", "body": "rightright\\n\\nAn electronic circuit is composed of individual electronic components, such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors and diodes, connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current can flow. The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another. Circuits can be constructed of discrete components connected by individual pieces of wire, but today it is much more common to create interconnections by photolithographic techniques on a laminated substrate (a printed circuit board or PCB) and solder the components to these interconnections to create a finished circuit. In an Integrated Circuit or IC, the components and interconnections are formed on the same substrate, typically a semiconductor such as silicon or (less commonly) gallium arsenide.\\n\\nBreadboard, perfboard or stripboard are common for testing new designs. They allow the designer to make quick changes to the circuit during development.\\n\\nAn electronic circuit can usually be categorized as an analog circuit, a digital circuit or a mixed-signal circuit (a combination of analog circuits and digital circuits).\\n\\nright\\n\\nAnalog electronic circuits are those in which current or voltage may vary continuously with time to correspond to the information being represented. Analog circuitry is constructed from two fundamental building blocks: series and parallel circuits. In a series circuit, the same current passes through a series of components. A string of Christmas lights is a good example of a series circuit: if one goes out, they all do. In a parallel circuit, all the components are connected to the same voltage, and the current divides between the various components according to their resistance.\\n\\nright\\n\\nThe basic components of analog circuits are wires, resistors, capacitors, inductors, diode, and transistor. (Recently, memristor have been added to the list of available components.) Analog circuits are very commonly represented in schematic diagram, in which wires are shown as lines, and each component has a unique symbol. Analog circuit analysis employs Kirchhoff's circuit laws: all the currents at a node (a place where wires meet) must add to 0, and the voltage around a closed loop of wires is 0. Wires are usually treated as ideal zero-voltage interconnections; any resistance or reactance is captured by explicitly adding a parasitic element, such as a discrete resistor or inductor. Active components such as transistors are often treated as controlled current or voltage sources: for example, a field-effect transistor can be modeled as a current source from the source to the drain, with the current controlled by the gate-source voltage.\\n\\nWhen the circuit size is comparable to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used. Wires are treated as transmission lines, with (hopefully) constant characteristic impedance, and the impedances at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line. Such considerations typically become important for circuit boards at frequencies above a GHz; integrated circuits are smaller and can be treated as lumped elements for frequencies less than 10 GHz or so. \\n\\nAn alternative model is to take independent power sources and induction as basic electronic units; this allows modeling frequency dependent negative resistors, gyrator, negative impedance converter, and dependent sources as secondary electronic components.\\n\\nIn digital electronic circuits, electric signals take on discrete values, to represent logical and numeric values. These values represent the information that is being processed. In the vast majority of cases, binary encoding is used: one voltage (typically the more positive value) represents a binary '1' and another voltage (usually a value near the ground potential, 0 V) represents a binary '0'. Digital circuits make extensive use of transistor, interconnected to create logic gate that provide the functions of Boolean logic: AND, OR, NOT, and all possible combinations there of. Transistors interconnected so as to provide positive feedback are used as latches and flip flops, circuits that have two or more metastable states, and remain in one of these states until changed by an external input. Digital circuits therefore can provide both logic and memory, enabling them to perform arbitrary computational functions. (Memory based on flip-flops is known as SRAM (static random access memory). Memory based on the storage of charge in a capacitor, DRAM (dynamic random access memory) is also widely used.) \\n\\nDigital circuits are fundamentally easier to design than analog circuits for the same level of complexity, because each logic gate regenerates the binary signal, so the designer need not account for distortion, gain control, offset voltages, and other concerns faced in an analog design. As a consequence, extremely complex digital circuits, with billions of logic elements integrated on a single silicon chip, can be fabricated at low cost. Such digital integrated circuits are ubiquitous in modern electronic devices, such as calculators, mobile phone handsets, and computers. \\n\\nDigital circuitry is used to create general purpose computing chips, such as microprocessor, and custom-designed logic circuits, known as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), chips with logic circuitry whose configuration can be modified after fabrication, are also widely used in prototyping and development.\\n\\nMixed-signal or hybrid circuits contain elements of both analog and digital circuits. Examples include comparator, timers, PLL, ADCs (analog-to-digital converter), and DACs (digital-to-analog converter). Most modern radio and communications circuitry uses mixed signal circuits. For example, in a receiver, analog circuitry is used to amplify and frequency-convert signals so that they reach a suitable state to be converted into digital values, after which further signal processing can be performed in the digital domain.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elena Baltacha", "body": " \\n\\nElena Baltacha (; born 14 August 1983) is a triple AEGON Award Winning, British tennis player of Ukrainian parentage who plays for Great Britain. She is the current British number 1, with a current ranking of World No. 55. Her career high ranking of World No. 49 was achieved on 13 September 2010.\\n\\nOver the course of her career she has won nine ITF singles titles (five $25,000, one $50,000, two $75,000 and one $100,000) and four ITF doubles titles (all $25,000). She has also twice been a runner-up in ITF events in singles and four times in doubles.\\n\\nIn 2010, Baltacha had victories over top 10 players Li Na and Francesca Schiavone, who at the time was the reigning French Open champion.\\n\\nBaltacha was born in Kiev, Ukraine. She comes from a sporting family: her father Sergei is a former professional footballer, representing the USSR and playing in the United Kingdom with Ipswich Town, St Johnstone and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, and her mother Olga represented the USSR in both the pentathlon and heptathlon at the Olympic Games. Her brother Sergei played football for Scottish Football League team St Mirren of Paisley and for Millwall.\\n\\nAfter arriving at Heathrow Airport on 13 January 1989, Elena moved to Ipswich where her father was to play football for the next year before moving to Scotland. The family lived in Perth where she grew up and spent her teenage years. At the age of 19 she was diagnosed with the liver condition primary sclerosing cholangitis and in June 2010 she became patron of the Children's Liver Disease Foundation \\n\\nCurrently living in Ipswich, England, she trains at Culford School near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and Ipswich Sports Club, where she is coached by Nino Severino, a multi-sports specialist in mental and movement training who has also worked with Ipswich Town F.C. and in coaching martial arts athletes. Baltacha can also call on LTA's Head Coach of Women's Tennis Nigel Sears and LTA Coach Simon Walsh.\\n\\nBaltacha played her first match on the ITF junior circuit in February 1997 and her last at the 2001 US Open junior tournament. She never won a title but reached the final of two junior tournaments, at the 14th Bahia Junior Cup and at the LTA International Junior Tournament, Bisham Abbey. She also reached the semifinals of three tournaments and the quarterfinals of six others. In 2001 she reached the semifinals of the Wimbledon juniors championships where she was beaten by eventual champion, Angelique Widjaja, 7–5 6–7 2–6. Over the course of her career as a junior, she gained wins over players such as Svetlana Kuznetsova, Gisela Dulko (twice) and Anne Keothavong. Her career-high singles ranking was World No. 77 and her final singles win-loss record was 40–40.\\n\\nAs a doubles competitor, Baltacha won four tournaments and lost in the final of four more. She also lost in the semifinal stages of tournaments four times and the quarterfinals eight times. Her final doubles win-loss record was 37–30 and her career-high doubles ranking was World No. 60.\\n\\nIn November 1997, Baltacha made her debut on the ITF circuit in Edinburgh where she was beaten in the first round of the qualifying stages in three sets by Danica Kovakova. She did however reach the quarterfinals of the doubles tournament.\\n\\nShe played only three adult ITF tournaments in 1998 (Birmingham, Southsea and Glasgow, all $10,000 events) and lost in the qualifying stages for each of them.\\n\\n1999 saw her first ITF main draw appearances. She competed in four tournaments in total and reached the quarterfinals of the $10,000 tournament in Glasgow.\\n\\nIn April 2000, Baltacha reached the quarterfinals of the $10,000 tournament in Bournemouth as a qualifier. She was given a wild card into the qualifying draw of her home Grand Slam, The Championships, Wimbledon where Flavia Pennetta beat her in three sets, 3–6 6–4 2–6. In October she received another wild card, this one into the Swisscom Challenge, a tier I tournament held in Zürich. The very next week she was a quarterfinalist at the $50,000 ITF tournament in Cardiff. Her season ending singles ranking was World No. 397.\\n\\nBaltacha reached the quarterfinals of her first tournament of the year in January, a $10,000 ITF tournament in Jersey when she was forced to retire with the score at 3–6 0–1. She was out of action until late April when she reached the quarterfinals of the $10,000 tournament in Hatfield. Two weeks later she reached the quarterfinals of the $25,000 tournament in Edinburgh as a qualifier. She followed this up with a run to the semifinals of the $25,000 event in Surbiton. She was then given a wild card into the qualifying draw for the tier II event in Eastbourne, the Britannic Asset Management International Championships where she beat Frenchwoman, Virginie Razzano, 3–6 6–1 6–1, in the final round of qualifying to reach the main draw. Conchita Martínez beat her in the first round, 3–6 3–6. Just a week later she was given a wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon to give her the first appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam. She was beaten, 1–6 5–7, by Nathalie Dechy in round one. Following Wimbledon she reached yet another ITF quarterfinal; this one in a $25,000 tournament in Felixstowe. She lost in round one of the qualifying tournament for the US Open in August and competed in four more ITF tournaments, reaching the quarterfinals of two of them (both $25,000). She ended the year with a singles ranking of World No. 248.\\n\\nIn February, Baltacha reached the quarterfinals of the $25,000 ITF tournament in Sutton. She played for her country in the Fed Cup in April and won her singles rubber against Norway's, Annette Aksdal, 6–0 6–1. She then beat Lina Stančiūtė from Lithuania in the relegation play offs in three sets, 4–6 6–2 6–2. Following this she attempted to qualify for the tier III, Croatian Bol Ladies Open where she was beaten in round one of the qualifying draw. This was the first of a string of five consecutive losses, the last of which was in the first round of the qualifying draw for the DFS Classic, a tier III event. She broke this string of losses with a win over Alina Jidkova in round one of the qualifying draw for the tier II, Britannic Asset Management International Championships. She was beaten by Elena Likhovtseva in the second round of qualifying. She was then given a wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon where she beat María Vento-Kabchi (6–4 6–4) in the first round and Amanda Coetzer (5–7 6–4 6–2) in the second round before losing to Elena Likhovtseva (for the second time in two consecutive tournaments), 4–6 6–7, in the third round.\\n\\nHer next tournament after Wimbledon was the $25,000 ITF event in Felixstowe which she won by beating Irishwoman, Kelly Liggan, in the final to give her the first ITF singles title of her career. Two weeks later she won her second title in Pamplona, again $25,000, when she defeated Virginie Pichet, 6–2 6–1, in the final. After this she attempted to qualify for the US Open but lost in the first round of the qualifying tournament for the second consecutive year. She played two more $25,000 ITF tournaments after the US Open, Glasgow and Southampton, where she reached the semifinals and quarterfinals respectively. Her season ending ranking for 2002 was World No. 157.\\n\\nBaltacha's 2003 season started slowly; she lost in round one of the qualifying tournament for the first Grand Slam of the year, the Australian Open. In April she was again part of the Great Britain Fed Cup team but lost her only match against Hungary's Petra Mandula, 1–6 3–6. She spent May failing to qualify for the tier III tournament, the Internationaux de Strasbourg and the second Grand Slam of the year, the French Open. In June she was given a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic but was forced to retire during her first round match verses fellow Brit, Jane O'Donoghue, with the score at 7–6 5–7 0–1. She was then awarded another wild card; this one into the qualifying draw of the tier II Hastings Direct International where she was beaten by Virginie Razzano, 4–6 1–6. For the third year running, she received a wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon where she forced the former world No. 5, Jelena Dokić, to fight for her eventual 3–6 6–1 4–6 victory. This was Baltacha's final match of the year as she underwent invasive surgery after Wimbledon (to determine the cause of her persistent liver troubles) which put her out of action until 2004. As a result, her year-end singles ranking fell to World No. 373.\\n\\nBaltacha returned to action with a vengeance in January 2004 by reaching the semifinals of her first two ITF tournaments of the year. These were the $10,000 event in Hull and the $25,000 event in Sunderland. She played in the Fed Cup for the Great Britain Fed Cup team where she won her two singles rubbers against Turkey and Romania by beating Cigdem Duru (6–1 6–0) and Monica Niculescu (6–1 6–4) respectively. She also beat Irishwoman, Yvonne Doyle, in the Europe/Africa Group II play-offs. In June, Samantha Stosur beat Elena in the first round of the DFS Classic and Cara Black beat her in the final round of the qualifying tournament for the Hastings Direct International one week later. Baltacha then headed to Wimbledon main draw courtesy of another wild card. She demolished World No. 61, Marta Marrero, 6–1 6–3, in round one before falling, 4–6 4–6, to 3-time Grand Slam champion, Jennifer Capriati in the second round.\\n\\nBetween Wimbledon and the US Open qualifying tournament (where she reached the second round before being beaten by Angelique Widjaja), she suffered three consecutive first-round losses in $50,000 ITF tournaments in the United States. After the US Open she reached the final of a $25,000 ITF event in Jersey where she lost, 6–3 2–6 1–6, to Emma Laine. She spent the remainder of her year competing on the ITF circuit and her year-end singles ranking rose to World No. 202.\\n\\nIn the 2005 Australian Open qualifying tournament she won three matches in straight sets to successfully qualify; she beat Els Callens, Jaslyn Hewitt and Teryn Ashley in rounds one, two and three respectively. In the first round of the main draw she beat Katarina Srebotnik, 5–7 6–4 6–4, who later remarked that the Brit was \"on fire\" and that \"if [Elena] plays like today, she can beat anyone. Some of the shots she was hitting were unbelievable.\" She continued her winning streak with another three set victory in round two, this one over Frenchwoman, Stéphanie Cohen-Aloro, 2–6 6–3 6–1. Unfortunately for Baltacha, she ran out of steam in the third round, losing 1–6 0–6 to No. 15 seed, Silvia Farina Elia. She used her momentum from her good performance in the first Grand Slam of the year to carry her to the semifinals of her next tournament, a $25,000 ITF event in Sunderland where she lost to Sofia Arvidsson, 6–1 6–7 0–6. She then immediately reached the finals of another $25,000 ITF event (this one in Redbridge) before being beaten, 0–6 3–6, by Nika Ožegović. She again played for Great Britain in the Fed Cup. She lost her singles rubber against Ana Timotic from Serbia, won her singles rubber verses Karina-Ildor Jacobsgaard and was demolished in her third singles rubber against Katarina Srebotnik, 1–6 1–6, in retribution for her first round Australian Open exit. In the Europe/Africa Group I play-off, Baltacha was defeated by Ukrainian, Alona Bondarenko, 1–6 3–6.\\n\\nShe then failed to qualify for two consecutive tier I events before losing in the first round of qualifying for the French Open when she was beaten by Elise Tamaela, 7–5 2–6 1–6. In June, three consecutive wild cards granted her entry into the main draws of the DFS Classic, the Hastings Direct International and Wimbledon where she was beaten by Milagros Sequera in the second round (after beating Alona Bondarenko in the first), Conchita Martínez in round one and Sabine Klaschka in the first round respectively. Following Wimbledon, Elena traveled to the ITF circuit in the United States without much success; she won only one of five matches she played in the run-up to the US Open qualifying draw where she also lost in the first round of qualifying. She then returned to the ITF circuit and reached the quarterfinals of the $25,000 event in Glasgow, the semifinals of the $25,000 event in Bolton and won the $25,000 tournament in Jersey. Her year-end singles ranking for the 2005 season was World No. 122.\\n\\nFor Baltacha, 2006 was a year much shortened by injury. Her first tournament of the year was the qualifying event for the Australian Open where she lost to Yuan Meng, 2–6 4–6, at the second stage of qualifying. In February she played one $25,000 ITF event (where she lost to Melanie South in the first round) and attempted to qualify for three consecutive tier II tournaments: Antwerp, Dubai (beaten in final round by Kateryna Bondarenko) and Qatar. This was then followed by two first round losses in $25,000 ITF tournaments and a run to the semifinals of another. In May she again represented Great Britain in the Fed Cup and again won all three of her singles matches. She beat: Hungarian, Kyra Nagy, Bulgaria's Dimana Krastevitch and Valeria Bondarenko from Ukraine. In the Europe/Africa play-off however, she lost to Slovakia's, Magdaléna Rybáriková. After the Fed Cup, Elena played only one more tournament in 2006. This tournament was the French Open where she lost in round one of qualifying to Yevgenia Savransky, 7–6 2–6 2–6. She underwent keyhole surgery on a prolapsed disc on the 7th June and spent the rest of the season out-of-action recovering and as a result, her season-ending ranking was World No. 347.\\n\\nBy the time Baltacha returned to action in March 2007 after surgery on a prolapsed disc, her singles ranking had fallen to 660 in the world and as such, she had to qualify for her first $25,000 ITF tournament of the year in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. She successfully qualified before losing to Sorana Cîrstea, 3–6 6–3 6–7, in the first round. She competed in two more $25,000 events in March (reaching the quarterfinals of one) before heading to Bulgaria to compete in the Fed Cup for Britain. She played two singles matches (winning one) and four doubles matches (winning two). Following this she reached two consecutive $25,000 ITF semifinals in Incheon and Gimcheon, one as a qualifier and the other as a lucky loser. She consolidated these results with a run to the quarterfinals of another $25,000 in Changwon. In June she received a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic where she showed \"fighting spirit\" in her first round loss to Milagros Sequera. She then received a wild card into the qualifying draw for the Hastings Direct International and proved she deserved it by dropping only nine games in the three matches she won to successfully qualify. She then went on to beat the British No. 1, Anne Keothavong, in round one of the main draw in a tense three set match, 6–2 2–6 7–6, and join fellow Britons, Melanie South and Katie O'Brien in the second round, making this the first year since 1991 that three British women reached the second round. She could not quite match up to World No. 14, Nicole Vaidišová, in the second round though; Baltacha was beaten, 3–6 2–6. She then received another wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon but wasn't able to overcome the 19th seed, Katarina Srebotnik, and lost 6–7 6–3 2–6.\\n\\nAfter Wimbledon, Baltacha headed to the United States to compete again on the ITF circuit where she reached the quarterfinals of the $50,000 event in Lexington. After being beaten in the first round of qualifying for the US Open by Evgeniya Rodina (2–6 4–6), Elena headed to Japan to attempt to qualify for the Japan Open. She beat Maria-Emilia Salerni, Agnes Szatmari and Natalie Grandin to qualify and then continued winning by defeating Yan Zi, 2–6 6–2 6–4, in the first round. She was defeated by No. 5 seed and eventual champion, Virginie Razzano, in round 2 with a score of 2–6 2–6. This was followed by an unsuccessful attempt to qualify for a tier III event in Bangkok and then a return to the ITF circuit where she reached the semifinals in Makinohara and the quarterfinals in Hamanako (both $25,000), losing both times to Japan's, Seiko Okamoto. Her final singles ranking of 2007 was World No. 187.\\n\\nBaltacha began her 2008 season by qualifying for the ASB Classic, beating compatriot, Melanie South, along the way. She faced two-time ASB Classic champion and No. 7 seed, Eleni Danilidou, in the opening round and was beaten decisively, 1–6 2–6. She then progressed to round two of the qualifying tournament for the Australian Open when her opponent, Virginie Pichet, retired when down one set. She was beaten in the second round of qualifying by Zhang Shuai, 4–6 1–6. In February she tried to qualify for Doha (tier I) and Dubai (tier II) but was unsuccessful in both.

{"title": "Elephas celebensis", "body": "Elephas celebensis or the Sulawesi dwarf elephant is an extinct species of elephant.\\n\\nThe Sulawesi dwarf elephant (Stegoloxodon celebensis or Elephas celebensis) was about half the size of Archidiskodon (=Mammuthus) planifrons to which it was initially considered to be related by Dirk Albert Hooijer in 1949. The most evident difference with the latter is the presence of functional lower tusk in some individuals. This was considered as paedomorphosis, a retention of juvenile characters in the adult stage, by Vincent Maglio in his revision of the proboscideans in 1973. He based his conclusion on the presence of vestigial incisive germs in mandibles of Mammuthus planifrons. This idea was followed by Hooijer in 1974.\\n\\nThe retention of functional lower tusks is, however, not seen in juveniles of otherwise single paired tuskers, so cannot be considered a paedomorphic feature proper. It is simply a retention of a primitive character, as seen in the African elephantid genera Primelephas and Stegotetrabelodon, and possibly the earliest forms of Mammuthus planifrons. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, an Indonesian-Dutch team excavated more material, including a fairly complete but rather distorted skull. All material, new as well as old, is described and revised in Van den Bergh’s thesis of 1999 on the Indonesian elephantoids, with a discussion on taxonomy. He puts question marks, “Elephas”, to indicate the uncertain taxonomical position, following Paul Sondaar’s approach of 1984. Van den Bergh accepts a possible relation with “Elephas” indonesicus from Ci Pangglosoran near Bumiayu on Java, dated to the same geological period. Also this specimen was originally assigned to Elephas (= Mammuthus) planifrons, but was later renamed Stegoloxodon indonesicus by Kretzoi in 1950. Recently, Georgi Markov and Haruo Saegusa made a further step and synonymized “Elephas” with Stegoloxodon in 2008.\\n\\nThe genus Stegoloxodon is restricted to Java and Sulawesi. The exact relation between the two endemic species is unclear, because the Javan species is known only by a single molar.\\n\\nFossils of the Sulawesi dwarf elephant are found in the Walanea Formation, dated to the Late Pliocene - Early Pleistocene. The single fossil of the Javanese species was found at Ci Pangglosoran near Bumiayu on Java, dated to the same geological period.\\n\\n"}

It is the world's smallest owl, followed closely by the Pygmy owl. They are 5-12 inches tall and have a wingspan of 15-16 inches and short tails. Their primary projection extends nearly past their tail. They have fairly long legs and often appear bow-legged. They weigh 1-1.4 ounces.They can often be heard just after dusk or at sunset, calling to each other. Their call is a high pitched whinny or chuckle. The male and female dart around trees and call back and forth.\\n\\nElf Owls usually choose abandoned, north-facing woodpecker cavities in Saguaro cacti, sycamore, cottonwood and other hardwood trees, to raise their young. The female usually lays three round white eggs. The eggs are incubated for about 3 weeks before the chicks hatch. The young owlets fledge at about 10 weeks. Usually, chicks are born in mid-June or early July. By the end of July, they are almost always fledged and ready to set out on their own.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThey are often found in chapparal habitat, and are easily found during their breeding season.\\n\\nThe elf owl migrates to Arizona and New Mexico in the spring and summer. In the winter, it is found in central and southern Mexico. Migrant Elf Owls return north in mid-August or early May.\\n\\nElf Owls feed mainly on insects and therefore occupy habitats with a ready supply of these. Agave and ocotillo are ideal places for foraging as moth and other insects may sleep in their flowers. Elf owls are known to eat scorpion, somehow managing to cut off the stinger. They are often seen chasing after flying insects, with a flight similar to a tyrant flycatcher's just after dusk.\\n\\nM. w. idonea, the subspecies in southernmost Texas to central Mexico is resident, as are the isolated M. w. sanfordi of southernmost Baja California and M. w. graysoni of Socorro Island, south-west from the tip of Baja California.

{"title": "Eli Terry", "body": "\\tEli Terry Sr. (April 13, 1772 – February 24, 1852) was an inventor and clockmaker in Connecticut. He received a United States patent for a shelf clock mechanism. He introduced mass production to the art of clockmaking, which made clocks affordable for the average American citizen. Terry occupies an important place in the beginnings of the development of interchangeable parts manufacturing. Terry became one of the most accomplished mechanics in New England during the early part of the nineteenth century. The village of Terryville, Connecticut is named for his son, Eli Terry Jr.\\n\\nTerry was the son of Samuel and Huldah Terry, born in what was is now South Windsor, Connecticut (at the time of Terry's birth, South Windsor was part of East Windsor, Connecticut.\\n\\nHe began his career as an apprentice under Daniel Burnap (\"the forerunner of manufacturing\"). It is also likely that he received limited instruction from Timothy Cheney, a clockmaker in East Hartford. Cheney specialized in the making of wooden clocks, which was fairly unusual at the time. The use of wooden components would show great influence in Terry's later career.\\n\\nTerry's apprenticeship to Burnap ended in 1792, and he quickly established himself as both a clockmaker and a repairer of watches in East Windsor. His earliest clocks were fitted with silvered brass dials, which were engraved for him by Burnap. The movements of the clock were made of brass or wood, depending on the requests of his customers. Brass was more commonly used for movements, but it was also considerably more expensive and difficult to work with. Terry moved to Northbury, Connecticut where he continued his business on a smaller scale for several years. In 1801, Terry was granted a patent on an equation clock. This was the first patent for a clock mechanism that was ever granted by the United States Patent Office.\\n\\nSoon after 1800, Terry's production of wooden clocks grew considerably. Like other Connecticut clock makers, Terry knew that apprentices could cheaply rough-cut wooden wheels for more skilled journeymen to shape precisely into clockworks, making clocks slightly more cheaply. And Terry was one of a number of Connecticut clock makers who began to substitute water-powered machines for apprentices in the production of these rough-cut wheels. In 1802 or 03, Terry purchased a mill to produce wooden clock wheels, which still had to be finished by hand by skilled journeymen clock makers. He purchased a grain mill and used the water wheel and main shaft to run saws and lathes, which helped speed the production of parts. He later created jigs and fixtures to produce a large number of interchangeable clock parts. This allowed for the rapid adjustment and assembly of clocks, freeing Terry from the task of fitting and modifying each individual piece of each clock. Using his own ingenuity and inventiveness, Terry was thus able to speedily cut wheels, pinions, and other important clock parts accurately and repetitively. \\n\\nIn the year 1806, Terry signed a contract to produce 4,000 wooden clock movements (other shops would make the cases). According to historian Diana Muir writing in Reflections in Bullough's Pond, at that time a skilled craftsman could produce six to ten clocks per year. Muir writes that Terry spent the first two years of the contract inventing and perfecting machinery that could turn clock wheels with enough precision to require relatively little shaping by skilled craftsmen. In the third year he produced 3,000 wooden clocks. He sold his manufactory to two of his assistants Seth Thomas and Silas Hoadley and retreated to his workshop to create the first machine in the world to be mass-produced using interchangeable parts.\\n\\nTerry envisioned a new kind of clock, intended for mass production from machine-made parts that would come from water-powered machines ready to go into clocks without any additional hand cutting by skilled workmen. This would be a shelf clock, costing less than a tall clock. It would be made quickly and be easily repaired. Terry's further innovations included the design of an escapement with removable verge. This later became a standard design feature of American clocks for the following century.The mass produced wooden clocks manufactured from interchangeable parts that poured from Terry's factory beginning in 1816 were the world's first mass produced machines made of interchangeable parts. As such he would mass market an affordable, complete cased-clock to American consumers. Terry's first clocks were offered in plain wooden box cases. Terry is also credited with the design of the pillar and scroll case. In his autobiography, History of the American Clock Business for the Past Sixty Years and Life of Chauncey Jerome Terry's employee and assistant Chauncey Jerome, later a great clock maker and owner of the world's largest clock factory, mentions building the first pillar and scroll in Terry's workshop with the master's design and under his direction. The pillar and scroll case provided a large, clear dial in a wooden case about thirty inches tall and six inches deep. The upper part was the clock face, the lower part was either a mirror or a picture back-painted on glass. Despite the small size of the clocks compared with traditional long case clocks, Terry was able to provide sufficient power through gearing for the clock to run a full thirty hours before it needed to be rewound. Anticipating a successful product Terry had the foresight to patent his arrangement of clockworks. At least five patents were issued to him through the years up to 1825 in order to protect his invention.\\n\\nAccording to Diana Muir in Reflections in Bullough's Pond, within a few years, several hundred men worked in two dozen factories in the Naugatuck Valley and Bristol produced virtually identical Terry-style thirty-hour wooden clocks. Salesmen innovated such now-familiar marketing devices as installment-plan purchases and model changes of the cases to induce consumers who already owned a functional clock to buy a more fashionable model. \\n\\nAs noted Terry was granted many patents for his advances in clock making, most of which were immediately infringed upon by local competitors eager to participate in satisfying the demand for an affordable clock. Many competitors would note \"patent clocks\" on their label in order to prevent litigation. One lawsuit did develop as noted below.\\n\\nTerry also produced wooden-movement tower clocks, such as those found in the steeples of churches and meeting houses, one of which is still operational today in the town of Plymouth.\\n\\nBetween 1808 and 1833, Terry focused the majority of his time and effort on the production of standardized wooden clocks, which helped him accumulate a modest fortune. By 1833, he was sufficiently satisfied his material success. At this point, he abandoned involvement in quantity production, and returned to clockmaking as the world had known it before his innovations, focusing on the production on a few high-end special clocks and the development of original clock mechanism. He also spent considerable time helping along the businesses of his sons. He continued with this small-scale clock production until his death on the last day of February in 1852.\\n\\nHis achievements place him in an unusual position in the history of clockmaking, leaving him as one of the last of the clock craftsmen, but also as the first of the true manufacturers. His shop represents one of the last Connecticut clock shops (of which there were many) in which there was both pride in workmanship and a high level of personal skill and aptitude.\\n\\nTerry's brother Samuel (1774–1853) was also involved in the production of wooden-movement clocks, and for several years he worked as Eli's partner, manufacturing improved pillar and scroll clocks after his brother's design.\\n\\nMost of Terry's sons also became clock makers. His son Eli Terry Jr. was the most famous, as the village of Terryville in Plymouth, Connecticut was named after him; he purchased the lock making equipment that would eventually be used to form Eagle Lock Company, which for a long period of time was Terryville's biggest employeer. \\n\\nHis son Andrew Terry began a very successful malleable iron foundry that later became OZ/Gedney, which has since moved to Mexico. That business was in operation for more than 150 years just down the stream from Andrew's brother Silas's clock shop.\\n\\nSilas had many financial difficulties in his time, but was eventually a founding member of the Terry Clock Company.\\n\\nEli Terry's success in mass producing and selling an affordable shelf clock for the public drew much inspiration from other entrepreneurs in Connecticut and beyond. Immediately Terry's former partners Seth Thomas and Silas Hoadley began making similar clocks. Others in the Bristol and Plymouth communities manufactured movements, cases or other clock parts for others to assemble and sell complete clocks in order to compete with Terry. Terry was forced to continually update his patents. Paradoxically his updated patents became very narrowly described and this enabled competitors to make slight changes to their design and evade patent infringement. In 1826-7, Eli Terry filed a lawsuit in Litchfield district court against Seth Thomas for patent infringement. Judgement was in favor of Terry but it is unclear if he ever collected compensation. Contemporary historians believe the suit was staged between the two principals in order to dissuade others from competition, but it is unclear that this is correct since Terry, unlike Thomas, was the least interested in the business side of mass clock production.\\n\\nAs one example of the frenzy at the time to copy Terry's designs, Reeves &amp; Co. made clocks in the United States to the Eli Terry design. These clocks faithfully copied the scrollwork and wooden movement of the original Eli Terry clocks. However, since the designs of these clocks were infringements of the Terry patents, Reeves &amp; Co. were forced out of business and were also forced to destroy their stock of unsold clocks. Very few genuine Reeves &amp; Co. clocks still exist. One excellent example of an operating Reeves &amp; Co. shelf clock is in the John Basmajian clock collection, in Altadena, California. Due to its rarity it is extremely valuable to collectors.\\n\\nEli Terry Elementary School, located only a few miles from Terry's childhood home in South Windsor, Connecticut, is named for the clockmaker. His likeness adorns a sign at the school's entrance.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eli Wallace", "body": "Eli Wallace is a fictional character in the Canadian-American television series Stargate Universe, a science fiction drama centering on the adventures of a present-day, multinational scientific team unable to return to Earth after an evacuation to the Ancient spaceship Destiny, which is traveling in a distant corner of the universe. He is portrayed by American actor David Blue. Blue auditioned for the role when he heard they were casting characters for the new show. Wallace is considered to be a complete slacker, yet at the same time an utter genius. Wallace made his first appearance in the pilot episode, \"Air\", first broadcast in the United States and Canada in 2009.\\n\\nBefore being recruited into Stargate Command, Wallace was a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), though he never graduated. His last job was in a fast food restaurant. Wallace lived with his mother Maryann, who contracted HIV from a needle stick when she was a nurse treating a drug user and could not find adequate medical coverage; the attack also caused his father to abandon them when Eli was 14 (\"Time\").\\n\\nSometime in 2009, Wallace solves a math problem in the Prometheus game. The problem that Eli solves is actually a Ancient mathematical proof that was procured from the Ancient Database. For this accomplishment, he is visited by Nicholas Rush and General Jack O'Neill, who are responsible for embedding the problem into the game. They offer him a chance to see the fruits of his labor (but do not elaborate on the details), then beam him aboard the ''George Hammond'' after his initial reluctance to sign the non-disclosure agreement. Rush wins Eli over by promising that the Air Force will provide his mother with the best medical care they have to offer.\\n\\nEli is transported to the Icarus Base to help Rush solve the mystery behind the ninth chevron of the Stargate. He jokingly gives himself the nickname \"Math Boy\" during a dinner conversation, which sticks. Though his formula is initially unsuccessful, Eli is key in discovering the problem with dialing the ninth chevron during an attack on the base, which allows Rush to dial the address. As a result, the remaining Icarus personnel are sent to the Destiny, an Ancient spaceship several billion light-years from Earth.\\n\\nDue to his deference to Colonel Young's authority, Eli becomes one of Young's confidants. He is the only civilian that Young trusts to handle technical problems and decipher Destiny's systems. Currently, Young has tasked Eli with using the Kinos to secretly spy on the crew, a mission that Eli is clearly uncomfortable with.\\n\\nEli is later left stranded off-ship along with Chloe, Greer and Lt. Scott. Greer manages to make it back before Destiny jumps to FTL (Faster than light), but Chloe, Scott and Eli are unable to dial Destiny due to Rush's search team returning, and eventually Destiny jumps to FTL to head to the next galaxy. Eli and company are unable to reach Destiny at first, but later, due to sabotage aboard Destiny, are able to return to the ship. During the last two episodes of season 1, Eli and Chloe Armstrong are left stranded on an unexplored part of the ship, while the ship is being taken over by the Lucian Alliance. Eli helps Scott and Greer back into the ship, reunites with Chloe who's leg wound heals due to what the blueberry aliens have done to her and he, Rush, Chloe and Brody force the Alliance forces to surrender and retake the ship. Eli later starts a relationship with Alliance scientist Ginn and is furious when she is murdered by Simeon, trying to go after him to take revenge before Colonel Young talks him down.\\n\\nDavid Blue became a fan of Stargate SG-1 when it moved from Showtime to the SCI FI Channel (now known as Syfy) and used to watch it when he came home from school. He also later caught up with Stargate Atlantis. His interest in the franchise later influenced him to audition for one of the main roles. Blue was shooting a scene for an episode of Ugly Betty when he heard that the Stargate Universe producers were casting actors. He soon after had an audition and a screen test. Blue has commented that he wanted the role even more when he heard that Robert Carlyle had been signed in for a part.\\n\\nBlue had never acted in the science fiction genre before being cast for Stargate Universe. Prior to Stargate Universe, he was best-known for his portrayal of Cliff in Ugly Betty. Blue himself has said that Stargate Universe is \"completely different\" from his previous work.\\n\\nWallace, EliWallace, Eli\\n\\n"}

Serving as a nurse at a lazarett in Weimar during the first year of World War I, and then for two years as a teacher at the Großherzogliche Sophienstift, she enrolled, in 1917, at the University of Jena to study history, philosophy, and German language and literature. She then switched to the University of Straßburg, then in Germany, where she attended lectures by Georg Simmel, and after one semester, as a result of the end of the war, to the University of Marburg, where she focused on medieval history and on pedagogy and philosophy, two subjects taught together there. Her teacher, who had a chair combining both fields, was the eminent Neo-Kantian Paul Natorp. In 1919, she switched to the University of Göttingen, where she met her most important academic teacher, Herman Nohl. In 1922, she passed the State Examn qualifying her to teach at the Gymnasium, and in 1923, she received a PhD in history.\\n\\nUntil 1926, Blochmann was instructor at the \"Social Women's School\" in Thale, Harz; from 1926 to 1930, lecturer at the Pestalozzi-Fröbel House, and from 1930, Professor of Social and Theoretical Pedagogy at the Academy of Education at Halle an der Saale. After the Nazis' rise to power, she was dismissed from that position in 1933 because of her Jewish background, and fled via the Netherlands to England. Unlike almost all other German émigrés, she was able to secure an eventually permanent position at a prestigious institution, Lady Margaret Hall, the oldest women's college of the University of Oxford, where she also was University Lecturer in Education (since 1945). In 1938, she received an Oxford MA, and in 1947, she became a British citizen.\\n\\nIn 1952, she was invited back to the University of Marburg, in order to build up the newly-founded, first independent Chair of General Education (Pedagogy), and decided to accept this call in spite of many qualms. During that year, she first became acting head of the chair, then Professor extraordinaria (full professor without a chair), and finally Professor ordinaria. During her Marburg time, she was the mentor of a large group of education scientists, many of whom going on to become very eminent scholars and administrators in her own right, forming a \"Blochmann School\". In 1960, she retired as Professor emerita, but substituted later for vacant chairs both in Marburg and Göttingen. \\n\\nIn 1972, Elisabeth Blochmann died of cancer in Marburg. Her grave is in the Urnenhain of the Ockershäuser Friedhof. Recently, a prominent square in the \"new center\" of downtown Marburg, was named after her.\\n\\nBlochmann's work covers history, philosophy, literature, and education. Most important is the latter, as it takes a key role in the establishment of scholarly work on the Kindergarten, as well as on women's education. In that field, her main scholarly interest was in its beginning, i.e. in the first institutions, such as girls schools, in Germany. \\n\\nOf some importance for, and great interest in, the history of philosophy is Blochmann's significant affair with her philosophical teacher Martin Heidegger. It is probably fair to say that, after that with Hannah Arendt, she had one of the most important extramarital affairs with Heidegger (as is known since 2005, Heidegger led something of an open marriage and his wife Elfriede both knew about his affairs and conducted her own). Elfriede Heidegger and Elisabeth Blochmann were friends and former classmates.\\n\\nThe story is well-documented in the 1989 edition of their letters, starting in 1918.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elizabeth Blackwell", "body": "Elizabeth Blackwell (3 February 1821 – 31 May 1910) was the first female doctor in the United States. She was the first openly identified woman to graduate from medical school, a pioneer in educating women in medicine in the United States, and was prominent in the emerging women's rights movement.\\n\\nElizabeth Blackwell was born in Bristol, England and spent her early years living in a house on Wilson Street, off Portland Square, St Pauls, Bristol.She was the third of nine children born to sugar refiner Samuel Blackwell and his wife, Hannah (née Lane). Blackwell could afford to give his numerous sons an education and also believed that his daughters should get the same education as boys, so he had them tutored by the house servants. While growing up, Blackwell lost six of her sisters and two of her brothers. One night when Blackwell was 11, a fire destroyed her father's business. In 1832, the family emigrated to the United States and set up a refinery in New York City. The Blackwells were very religious Quaker. They believed that all men and women were equal in the eyes of God. Due to their Quaker beliefs, the Blackwell family was anti-slavery. An opportunity was presented to Samuel Blackwell that allowed him to open a refinery in Ohio, where slaves would not be needed to harvest the sugar, so the Blackwells moved to Cincinnati. Three months after they moved, Elizabeth's father contracted what was then known as biliary fever, and died.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nAfter the death of her father, Blackwell took up a career in teaching in Kentucky to make money to pay for medical school. Blackwell found this work unpleasant. Desiring to apply herself to the practice of medicine, she took up residence in a physician's household, using her time there to study from the family's medical library. She became active in the anti-slavery movement (as did her brother Henry Brown Blackwell who married Lucy Stone, a suffragist). Another brother, Samuel Charles Blackwell, married another important figure in women's rights, Antoinette Brown. In 1845, she went to Asheville, North Carolina, where she read medicine in the home of Dr. John Dickson. Afterwards, she read with his brother Dr. Samuel Henry Dickson in Charleston, South Carolina.\\n\\nShe attended Geneva College in New York. She was accepted there — supposedly because the faculty put it to a student vote, and the students thought her application was a hoax — and braved the prejudice of some of the professors and students to complete her training. Blackwell is said to have replied that if the instructor was upset by the fact that Student No. 156 wore a bonnet, she would be pleased to remove her conspicuous headgear and take a seat at the rear of the classroom, but that she would not voluntarily absent herself from a lecture. \\n\\nOn 11 January 1849, Blackwell became the first woman to achieve a medical degree in the United States, and graduated, on 23 January 1849.\\n\\nBanned from practice in most hospitals, she was advised to go to Paris, France and train at La Maternité, but had to continue her training as a student midwife, not a physician. While she was there, her training was cut short when in November, 1849 she caught a serious right eye infection, purulent ophthalmia, from a baby she was treating. She had to have her right eye removed and replaced with a glass eye. This loss brought to an end her hopes to become a surgeon.\\n\\nIn 1853, Blackwell along with her sister Emily and Dr. Marie Zakrzewska, founded their own infirmary, the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children, in a single room dispensary near Tompkins Square in Manhattan. During the American Civil War, Blackwell trained many women to be nurses and sent them to the Union Army. Many women were interested and received training at this time. After the war, Blackwell had time, in 1868, to establish a Women's Medical College at the Infirmary to train women, physicians, and doctors.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIn 1857, Blackwell returned to England where she attended Bedford College for Women for one year. In 1858, under a clause in the 1858 Medical Act that recognized doctors with foreign degrees practising in Britain before 1858, she was able to become the first woman to have her name entered on the General Medical Council's medical register (1 January 1859).\\n\\nIn 1869, she left her sister Emily in charge of the college and returned to England. There, with Florence Nightingale, she opened the Women's Medical College. Blackwell taught at London School of Medicine for Women, which she had co-founded, and accepted a chair in gynecology. She retired a year later.\\n\\nDuring her retirement, Blackwell still maintained her interest in the women's rights movement by writing lectures on the importance of education. Blackwell is credited with opening the first training school for nurses in the United States in 1873. She also published books about diseases and proper hygiene.\\n\\nShe was an early outspoken opponent of circumcision and in 1894 said that \"Parents, should be warned that this ugly mutilation of their children involves serious danger, both to their physical and moral health.\" She was a proponent of women's rights and pro-life.\\n\\nHer female education guide was published in Spain, as was her autobiography.\\n\\nIn 1856, she adopted Katherine \"Kitty\" Barry, an orphan of Irish origin, who was her companion for the rest of her life.\\n\\nIn 1907 Blackwell was injured in a fall from which she never fully recovered. She died on 31 May 1910 at her home in Hastings in Sussex after a stroke. She was buried in June 1910 in Saint Mun's churchyard at Kilmun on Holy Loch in the west of Scotland.\\n\\n"}

Some of her verses were recently compiled in a book published by Solid Ground Christian Books (''Golden Hours: Heart-hymns of the Christian Life'').\\n\\nShe was born and raised in Portland, Maine, United States, the fifth of eight children (only six survived) of the eminent Congregationalist pastor Edward Payson. The influences of New England Christianity, consisting of the inherited Puritan foundation with added evangelistic, missional, and philanthropic elements, were evident in the Payson family. From an early age, Elizabeth exhibited sharp mental abilities, deep and indiscriminatory sympathy, and an exceptional perceptiveness. Combined, these traits made her an ideal author, not only of instructive children's books, but also of characteristically warm and insightful letters to family and a wide circle of friends. As a young woman, she published some of her children's stories and poems in \"The Youth's Companion,\" a New England religious periodical. In 1838, she opened a small girls' school in her home and took up a Sabbath-school class as well. Two years later, she left for Richmond, Virginia, to be a department head at a girls' boarding school.\\n\\nIn 1845, she married George Lewis Prentiss, a brother of her dear friend Anna Prentiss Stearns, to whom are addressed some of her warmest and most intimate letters. The Prentisses settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where George became pastor of South Trinitarian Church. After a happy time of transitioning into the duties of a pastor's wife and a housewife, within a period of three months she lost her second and third children – one as a newborn, one at age four. She wrote this poem in that year, 1852, on the occasion of the baby's death:\\n\\nThough she continually struggled with poor health, Mrs. Prentiss went on to have three more healthy children. After Rev. Prentiss resigned his charge in New York, the family went abroad to Europe for a couple of years, returned to New York (where Rev. Prentiss pastored the Church of the Covenant), and eventually settled in Dorset, VT, where Mrs. Prentiss would die in 1878 at the age of 60.\\n\\nAfter her death, Rev. Prentiss published The Life and Letters of Elizabeth Prentiss (1882), for the purpose of fulfilling his wife's wish that the more costly experiences of her life could be used for the consolation of others. Mrs. Prentiss's peculiar trials enabled her to sympathize even more deeply with those who suffered such that, later in life, she declared that she loved the house of mourning better than the house of feasting (see Ecclesiastes 7:2).\\n\\nMrs. Prentiss had six children, of whom four survived. \\n\\n"}

She has been a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario since 1990, originally representing Waterloo North and later Kitchener—Waterloo for the Progressive Conservative Party.\\n\\nWitmer moved with her family to Ontario at a young age. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Ontario, and later attended the Althouse College of Education. She did postgraduate work at the University of Waterloo. Witmer worked as a secondary school teacher from 1968 to 1980, in West Lorne, London and Guelph. She was named the \"Kitchener-Waterloo Woman of the Year\" in 1968.\\n\\nWitmer began her political career as a school trustee, serving on the Waterloo County Board of Education from 1980 to 1990; she became its chair in 1984. She first ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1987 election, but was defeated by Ontario Liberal Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Herb Epp in Waterloo North.\\n\\nEpp retired before the 1990 provincial election, and Witmer again won the Progressive Conservative nomination in the riding. She was successful this time, defeating New Democrat Hugh Miller and Liberal Andrew Telegdi (later a federal Member of Parliament). The NDP scored an upset victory in this election while the Progressive Conservatives won only 20 of 130 seats for third-party status.\\n\\nThere was a significant swing to the Progressive Conservatives in the 1995 provincial election, and Witmer was re-elected by more than 17000 votes over her nearest opponent. On June 26, 1995, she was appointed Minister of Labour in the government of Mike Harris. In October 1997, she was promoted to the key portfolio of Minister of Health, replacing the more confrontational Jim Wilson.\\n\\nHarris's government was initially regarded by many as uniformly right-wing, although moderate Red Tory figures such as Witmer and Isabel Bassett eventually emerged in key portfolios. Witmer's appointment as Minister of Health was generally interpreted as signalling that the government desired a more moderate approach to negotiations with the health sector. Despite this, she presided over a controversial restructuring process which included a number of government cutbacks.\\n\\nWitmer was re-elected in the 1999 election, defeating Liberal Sean Strickland by just under 10,000 votes. On July 17, 1999 her portfolio was renamed the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, and she focused her ministry's attention on community services and long-term care. Following a cabinet shuffle on February 8, 2001, she became Minister of the Environment.\\n\\nShe ran in the 2002 PC leadership election to succeed Harris as Tory leader and Premier, but placed fourth on the first ballot and threw her support to the eventual winner, Ernie Eves. In April 2002, she was appointed Deputy Premier and Minister of Education.\\n\\nThe 2003 election saw a significant backlash against the Conservative government. Witmer was re-elected in Kitchener—Waterloo (again defeating Strickland, this time by 1501 votes), but was one of only 24 Progressive Conservatives returned. Moreover, she is considered to be one of the few moderates in a caucus dominated by the right-wing of the party. She was named as deputy leader of the opposition, and serves as her party's critic on long-term care and women's issues.\\n\\nWitmer considered running to succeed Eves in the 2004 PC leadership election, but ultimately supported John Tory's successful candidacy instead. Tory re-appointed Witmer as deputy leader. Her appointment was considered a notable victory for the centrist wing of the party. In the 2007 provincial election, Witmer won re-election by 4,917 votes.\\n\\nWitmer again considered running in the 2009 PC leadership election, following the resignation of John Tory, but ultimately she decided to endorse Christine Elliott.\\n\\nWitmer recently won the \"Ontario's Greatest Female Premier\" contest conducted by Equal Voice where runners up were political activist Georgina Bencsik and Federal MP Olivia Chow.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Elysian Fields Avenue", "body": "rightElysian Fields Avenue is a broad, straight avenue in New Orleans named after the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris. It courses south to north from the Lower Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain, a distance of approximately . The avenue intersects with Interstate 610, Interstate 10, and U.S. Highway 90, Gentilly Boulevard passing by Brother Martin High School. The part between North Claiborne Avenue (Louisiana Highway 39) and Gentilly Boulevard (U.S. Route 90) is Louisiana Highway 3021 (LA 3021); the piece from N. Claiborne Avenue south to St. Claude Avenue carries Louisiana Highway 46 (which turns east on St. Claude Avenue).\\n\\nFor more than half of its route, from the river to Gentilly Boulevard (U.S. Route 90), it is six lanes wide; the remainder north of Gentilly Boulevard is four lanes wide. Anchoring the lake end and river end (northern and southern termini) respectively are the University of New Orleans and the Esplanade Avenue Wharf.\\n\\nThe location of Elysian Fields Avenue originated in the early 19th century placement of a sawmill canal on the Marigny Plantation, which at that time was just outside of New Orleans proper (the present French Quarter). In 1831 the Pontchartrain Railroad was built from that location straight to Lake Pontchartrain. The railroad carried both goods and passengers. Among the railroad's steady revenue sources was mail, which was carried from New Orleans to Lake Pontchartain for transfer to Mobile, Alabama-bound ships. The railroad, which came to be known locally as \"Smoky Mary\", operated until 1935. The tracks were removed in the 1950s.\\n\\nTwo RTA bus routes operated on Elysian Fields Avenue: one local (est. in the 1950s, first known as just Elysian Fields [or Elysian Fields - Pont. Beach/UNO], and later 55 Elysian Fields), the other an express (est. December 5, 1960, first known as Express 91 - Pontchartrain Beach via Elysian Fields, later 56 Elysian Fields Express). Both routes were shut down before the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina; as of November 28, 2005 only the Elysian Fields local route has been returned to service.\\n\\nElysian Fields is also the street on which Tennessee Williams's play A Streetcar Named Desire is set.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emelan", "body": "Emelan is a fictional realm that provides the main setting of the Circle of Magic quartet by Tamora Pierce, primarily in the capital city of Summersea and the nearby temple of Winding Circle. Of the follow-up books, only Magic Steps of the quartet The Circle Opens and the opening sequence of the standalone book The Will of the Empress take place in Emelan. \\n\\nThe map of Emelan and the surrounding countries is noticeably based on the Mediterranean and Middle East regions, both in geographical features and in culture. \\n\\nEmelan itself resides on the northern shore of the Pebbled Sea, the fictional equivalent of the Mediterranean sea. Its location parallels that of Greece on the world map, extending a peninsula surrounded by many island of various sizes into the sea. However, Emelan seems to extend over a larger and more diverse territory.\\n\\nAll countries between Namorn in the north and Tharios in the south were once a part of the Kurchal Empire, and the language common to these areas is still called Imperial or Imperial Kurchali. Chammur seems to be the exception to this, since in Street Magic Briar Moss takes pains to learn the Chammuri language, and debates about whether or not he should teach his student Evvy to read and write it. This may be for the same reason that Sotat does not enforce its sovereignty over Chammur, since it's located in a distant, mountainous desert. As well, the fall of the Kurchal Empire gave rise to the term \"K.F.\" after the listing of a date, such as 1041 K.F., as frequently mentioned in The Will of the Empress. This probably refers to the term A.D. (in comparison to B.C.) in the Western world.\\n\\nEmelan is a sovereign duchy with an extensive noble class. The inheritance of the ducal throne seems to be combined with a merit system; references in The Will of the Empress reveal that Duke Vedris IV, the current ruler of Emelan, has the power to choose his own heir, through rumors that he is considering displacing his third son (Franzen fer Toren, mentioned in passing and listed in the book's glossary) in favor of his grandniece, protagonist Sandrilene fa Toren. \\n\\nMost countries in the Emelan Universe have monarchic systems of government: Namorn is an empire ruled by Empress Berenene dor Ocmore, Yanjing is an empire(possibly based on China, as it is called the Empire of Silk) with an unknown ruler, Chammur is an emirate and the noble class is abundant almost everywhere. One prominent exception to this rule is the city state of Tharios, which is ruled by an Assembly, although it, too is an oligarchy effectively ruled by the first and highest caste. The caste system in Tharios operates on a principle of divine privilege similar to the one nobility works on. \\n\\nKnown conflicts in the world of Emelan include: \\n\\nThe culture around the Pebbled Sea is strongly based on that of the Middle East. While most locations visited in the books are ethnically mixed, showing characters of apparent Chinese, black, caucasian, India, Middle East and multiracial ethnicities, some of the clothing and most of the food consumed in the region have a strong Middle Eastern flavor. The cuisine favors chickpea, \"flatbread\", couscous and baklawa, among other things. \\n\\nBy contrast, the Namornese culture has a distinct Russia overtone,<ref name=\"\"scholastic\">''The Circle Opens'' Discussion Guide, Rosemary B. Stimola, Scholastic Corporation website, retrieved February 19, 2007.</ref> and the culture of Tharios is mixed; its city state status and democratic tradition have roots in ancient Greece (as well as many Tharian words being very similar to Greek words - shenos/xenos, kyten/chiton), the caste system is based not on the Indian caste system but on the Japanese Burakumin, and the pleasure district of Khapik is based on traditional Japan geisha.\\n\\nThe temple of Winding Circle belongs to the fictional religion, the Living Circle. It is a polytheistic. nature-worshipping religion, based on the classical element system of air, fire, water and earth, with two god, one male and one female, dedicated to each element. A temple is dedicated to each of the four elements within each Living Circle temple-city. \\n\\nThe philosophy of the Living Circle is based on harmony and balance, and opposition of fanaticism. Liberal about sex in general and homosexuality in particular, Dedicates of the Living Circle are not celibate, but are discouraged from pursuing either marriage or child at the expense of their devotion to their god. \\n\\nTamora Pierce on the Living Circle, SheroesCentral, June 28, 2005. \\n\\nTim Liebe on the Living Circle, SheroesCentral, January 3, 2004. \\n\\nVarious minor, specialized gods exist alongside the worship of the Living Circle. These include trickster gods dedicated to thieves such as Lakik, gods of law enforcement such as Harrier the Clawed, and other profession gods. \\n\\nTrader have two gods, Trader Koma and Bookkeeper Oti, and also pay homage to their ancestors with religious ceremony, altar and incense. \\n\\nNamorn has its own pantheon of gods, which is also, to an extent, base on the classical elements. Hospital are named after Yorgiry, the goddess of healing. \\n\\nTharios worships the All-Seeing, and an assortment of minor gods.\\n\\nAcademic magic follows the traditional fantasy genre rules for use of magic. It is a potential that only exists in some individuals, born mages, which can be detected by magic sniffers, sight-mages who specialize in discovering children with magical potential. Magical education may take place in temples, such as Winding Circle, or universities, such as Lightsbridge. At some point during the training the mages choose their own specialty, and once their training is complete they receive a certificate in the form of a medallion bearing their specialty and the names of their primary teacher. \\n\\nMages are also entitled to choose new surname for themselves that will declare their specialty to potential employers. Niklaren Goldeye chose his name because his specialty is seeing things that most people, even other mages, cannot see. By contrast, all four protagonist of the series have chosen to keep their given name--although Briar Moss merely kept the name he chose when Niklaren found him.\\n\\nAmbient magic, although it also exists as a potential from birth and cannot be manufactured, operates on a different principle. It is tied to a specific craft, power or raw material, ranging from carpentry to dance to weather. Ambient mages can only work with the craft their magic is tied to. Ambient mages are rarer than academic ones, at a ratio of about one to four. Both the Circle of Magic and The Circle Opens series focus on the mechanics of ambient magic, shifting viewpoints to show several different types. \\n\\nThe existence of ambient mages is one of the reasons why magic is such a commonplace thing in the Emelan Universe. It manifests as just another aspect of an artisan's expertise, and exemplifies the philosophy that magic exists in all things, no matter how seeingly mundane. This distincts it from other fantastical magic systems, which often manifest as fire or lightning, but rarely as weaving, smithing and other daily craft.\\n\\nCanon novels set in the Emelan Universe. \\n\\nThe Circle of Magic quartet: \\n\\nThe Circle Opens quartet: \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Emilio De Bono", "body": "Emilio De Bono (March 19, 1866, Cassano d'Adda, Province of Milan – January 11, 1944) was an Italian General, fascist activist, Marshal, and member of the Fascist Grand Council (Gran Consiglio del Fascismo). De Bono fought in the Italo-Turkish War, World War I, and the Second Italo-Abyssinian War.\\n\\nDe Bono was born in Cassano d'Adda. He entered the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) in 1884 as a Second Lieutenant and had worked his way up to General Staff by the Italo-Turkish War of 1911. De Bono would later to go on to fight in World War I, where he distinguished himself against the Austrians in Gorizia in 1916 and Monte Grappa in October 1918. In 1920, he was discharged with the rank of Major General.\\n\\nDuring the early 1920s, De Bono helped organize the National Fascist Party. In 1922, as one of the four Quadrumvirs, he organized and staged the \"March on Rome.\" This event signalled the start of the Fascist regime in Italy. \\n\\nIn the period following the march, De Bono served as Chief of Police and Commander of the Fascist Militia.\\n\\nDe Bono was tried for his role in the 1924 death of the leftist politician Giacomo Matteotti. He refused to implicate his superiors and was surprisingly acquitted in 1925. In that same year, De Bono was appointed as the Governor of Tripolitania in Libya. \\n\\nIn 1929, De Bono was appointed the Minister of Colonial Affairs (also referred to as the Minister of Colonies). In 1932, King Victor Emmanuel and De Bono visited Eritrea and, according to them, found a peaceful, loyal, and contented colony.\\n\\nIn November 1932, per a request from Mussolini, De Bono wrote up a plan for an invasion of Ethiopia. What he wrote indicated that he envisioned a traditional mode of penetration. A limited force would move gradually southward from Eritrea. The force would establish bases of strength and, from these bases, advance against increasingly weakened and disorganized opponents. The invasion DeBono envisioned would be cheap, easy, safe, -- and slow.\\n\\nMussolini also involved the Army in the planning stages and, over a two year period, the Army developed an invasion plan which included a massive campaign which would involve five to six times the number of troops required for De Bono's plan. In 1934, Mussolini pulled both of the previously uncoordinated plans together into a plan that included the military's idea of a full-scale war.\\n\\nIn 1935, De Bono became the Supreme Commander of the Italian operation against Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. In addition, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the forces invading from Italian-held Eritrea on what was known as the \"northern front.\" De Bono had under his direct command a force of nine divisions in three Army Corps: The Italian I Corps, the Italian II Corps, and the Eritrean Corps. \\n\\nOn October 3, forces under De Bono's command crossed into Ethiopia from Eritrea. On October 6, his forces retook Adowa, officially avenging the humiliating 1896 Italian defeat. Soon thereafter, De Bono entered the historically significant city of Axum riding a white horse. After these initial triumphs, De Bono's advance slowed appreciably. \\n\\nOn November 8, the I Corps and the Eritrean Corps captured Mek'ele. This proved to be the limit of how far the Italian invaders would get under the command of De Bono. Increasing pressure from the rest of the world on Mussolini caused him to need fast glittering victories. He was not prepared to hear of obstacles or delays from De Bono. \\n\\nOn November 16, De Bono was promoted to Marshal of Italy (Maresciallo d'Italia). But Mussolini continued to grow impatient with his slow progress and, by December, De Bono was relieved of his command. On 17 December, De Bono received State Telegram 13181 (Telegrama di Stato 13181) which indicated that, with the capture of Mek'ele, his mission was accomplished. His place was taken by Marshal Pietro Badoglio. De Bono was appointed the Inspector of Overseas Troops.\\n\\n300pxIn 1940, De Bono commanded a southern defense corps headquartered in Sicily and was opposed to the Italian entry into World War II. But he kept a low profile and, in 1942, he was appointed Minister of State. \\n\\nOn July 24 and July 25, 1943, De Bono was one of the members of the Fascist Grand Council who voted to oust Benito Mussolini when Dino Grandi carried out a coup d'état, in collaboration with Pietro Badoglio and King Victor Emmanuel III. This led to the dictator's downfall, arrest, and imprisonment.\\n\\nLater in 1943, Mussolini was rescued during the Gran Sasso raid and returned to power by Nazi Germany. He was set up in northern Italy by the Germans as the \"Duce of the Nation\" of a new Italian Social Republic (Repubblica Sociale Italiana, or RSI). Upon his return to power, Mussolini had De Bono and others who voted against him arrested. He then had Alessandro Pavolini try them for treason at Verona in what became known as the \"Verona trial.\" De Bono was convicted in a trial where the outcome was known prior to its start. \\n\\nOn January 11 1944, the 77-year old De Bono was executed by firing squad at Verona. He was shot along with Galeazzo Ciano, Luciano Gottardi, Giovanni Marinelli and Carlo Pareschi. Ciano was the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mussolini's son-in-law. Gottardi was the former president of the Fascist Confederation of Industrial workers. Marinelli was the former chief of the Fascist militia and Pareschi was the former Agriculture Minister. The only person on trial who escaped from capital punishment was Tullio Cianetti, the Minister of Corporations. Cianetti was sentenced to thirty years by the RSI judges.\\n\\n"}

At the age of 20, after studying art and design at the University of Hertfordshire he moved to London to pursue a career in art, where he Lived and worked in the economically depressed Hackney, London between the years 1987 and 1998. During this time he encountered diverse influences, including underground film, Santaria, Anarchism, squatting, outsider art, art collective installations using found material, and site-specific installation art. All of which was going on in the relative obscurity of one of the poorest areas of london. In 1998 Emit moved to Hamilton, New Zealand, continuing to work with multi-media projects including street theatre and the organisation of a 13 piece Free improvisation orchestra called The Kaosphere orchestra. In 2006 he founded the Hamilton Underground Film Festival and created Karen Karnak an invented multiple-use name nom-de-plume which multiple filmmakers could participate.thumb\\n\\nThe Remote Viewers (2008) examines the connection between technology, the mass media and magic.

The first three shrines were destroyed but the super 8mm film, which documented the process, was preserved and exhibited in a series of underground film festivals including the exploding cinema insummer 1993. The preservation of The Shrine led to the beginning of a series of coin operated shrines, which are described below, as well as the beginning of several super 8mm films. Santa Arson (1995), filmed on super 8mm, was made with Steve Rife, a pyrotechnics artist from Saint Paul, Minnesota.\\n\\nBetween the years 1991 and 2001 Emit Snake-Beings created over 30 coin-operated electrical shrines, reflecting a combination of technology and religious deities within a polytheist system.

In 1871, she returned to Wisconsin and enrolled in Ripon College, where she graduated in 1874. After graduation she taught in public school for two years and then moved to Milwaukee, where she worked as a journalist. In 1892, she began postgraduate work in history, economics and sociology at Wisconsin State University. She later became a librarian at the Wisconsin Historical Society.\\n\\nIn 1894, Blair resigned from the library staff and became assistant to Dr. Reuben Gold Thwaites. Thwaites was the translator of the 73-volume work Jesuit Relations (1896-1901). This massive work consisted of English translations of the annual reports issued by the superior of the Jesuit missions in New France to the Jesuit overseer in France between the years 1632 and 1673. Blair participated in the editing and annotations. After her work on the Jesuit Relations, she assisted in the editing of the journal of Father Louis Hennepin and of the journals of the Lewis and Clark expedition, still working with Thwaites.\\n\\nIn 1903, she began work on the project she is most remembered for, the translation and editing of Philippine historical documents that were published in the 55-volume series The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 (1903-09).

{"title": "Emotional insecurity", "body": "Insecurity is a feeling of general unease or nervousness that may be triggered by perceiving of oneself to be unloved, inadequate or worthless (whether in a rational or an irrational manner). \\n\\nA person who is insecure lacks confidence in their own value and capability, lacks trust in themselves or others, or has fears that a present positive state is temporary and will let them down and cause them loss or distress by \"going wrong\" in the future. \\n\\nThis is not to be confused with humility, which involves recognizing one's shortcomings but still maintaining a healthy dose of self-confidence. Insecurity is not an objective evaluation of one's ability but an emotional interpretation, as two people with the same capabilities may have entirely different levels of insecurity.\\n\\nInsecurity may cause shyness, paranoia and social withdrawal, or alternatively it may encourage compensatory behaviors such as arrogance, aggression, or bullying, a principle enshrined in the phrase \"all bullies are cowards.\" Many people suffer a period of insecurity during puberty, which gives rise to a lot of the stereotypical behaviors of adolescent.\\n\\nAlso, sometimes people who have a strong character can actually suffer from emotional insecurity. They may subconsciously have a naturally strong character to hide inner personal feelings. \\n\\nInsecurity has many effects in a person's life. There are several levels of it. It nearly always causes some degree of isolation as a typically insecure person withdraws from people to some extent. The greater the insecurity, the higher the degree of isolation becomes. Insecurity is often rooted in a person's childhood years. Like offense and bitterness, it grows in layered fashion, often becoming an immobilizing force that sets a limiting factor in the person's life. Insecurity robs by degrees; the degree to which it is entrenched equals the degree of power it has in the person's life.\\n\\nAs insecurity can be distressing and feel threatening to the psyche, it can often be accompanied by a controlling personality type or avoidance, as psychological defense mechanism.\\n\\nInsecurity can be overcome. It takes time, patience and a gradual realization that one's own worth is purely a matter of perspective (or subjective opinion of oneself), and so while it may be true that insecurity can follow from concerns relating to objective reality, this is by no means a necessity, but more a tendency. Given that insecurity is counter-productive and has no benefits as opposed to self-assuredness, it follows that the latter is preferable. The first of Erikson's stages of psychosocial development details the challenge of finding security and learning to trust oneself and one's environment.\\n\\n"}

He was a son of Emperor Ming and younger brother (by the same mother) of Emperor Cheng. His reign was brief—only two years.\\n\\nSima Yue was born in 322 as the second son of Emperor Ming, by his wife Empress Yu Wenjun. After his father died in 325 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Cheng, Sima Yue was created the Prince of Wu in 326. In 327, because his uncle Sima Yu the Prince of Langye wanted to yield that more honorific title, Sima Yu was created the Prince of Kuaiji and Sima Yue was created the Prince of Langye. It is not known where Sima Yue was during the Su Jun Disturbance of 326–328—whether he was captured and held hostage like his emperor brother, at his principality of Wu (which Su Jun did not occupy), or elsewhere. During his brother's reign, he received a progression of offices, but did not appear to actually participate in major decision-making.\\n\\nIn summer 342, Emperor Cheng grew gravely ill. He had two young sons -- Sima Pi and Sima Yi, then still in cradles, by his concubine Consort Zhou. Yu Bing (庾冰), one of the top two officials and Emperor Cheng's (and Sima Yue's) uncle, fearful that the Yus would lose power if a young emperor were named, persuaded Emperor Cheng that in the face of the powerful enemy Later Zhao that an older emperor should be named. Emperor Cheng agreed and designated Sima Yue the Prince of Langye, despite the other top official He Chong (何充)'s opposition. He died soon after, and Sima Yue took the throne as Emperor Kang. (He did not make secret his opposition, and after Emperor Kang took the throne, when he thanked Yu and He for making him emperor, He stated, \"The reason why Your Imperial Majesty can fly like a dragon is Yu Bing. If I were listened to, we would not have this current prosperous reign.\" Emperor Kang appeared humiliated, but did not retaliate against He (although He himself would request to become a local governor to avoid working with Yu Bing, and his request was granted) and continued to respect him.)\\n\\nIn early 343, Emperor Kang created his wife Chu Suanzi empress.\\n\\nLater in 343, Emperor Kang's other uncle, Yu Yi (庾翼), proposed a major military campaign against Later Zhao, in coordination with Former Yan's ruler Murong Huang and Former Liang's ruler Zhang Jun, both nominal Jin vassals. Most officials feared this large undertaking, but with support from Yu Bing, Huan Wen (Emperor Kang's brother-in-law, having married his sister Sima Xingnan (司馬興男) the Princess Nankang), and Sima Wuji (司馬無忌) the Prince of Qiao, Emperor Kang approved the plan and mobilized troops. Yu Bing was made a governor to coordinate with Yu Yi, and He Chong was recalled to replace him, and served in conjunction with Emperor Kang's father-in-law Chu Pou (褚裒) (who, however, soon yielded his post). However, Yu Yi eventually, for reasons unknown, largely did not carry out his campaign, although he made some border attacks.\\n\\nIn fall 344, Emperor Kang grew ill. Yu Bing and Yu Yi wanted to support his uncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji as emperor, but He Chong, consistent with his prior advice to Emperor Cheng, suggested that Emperor Kang should pass the throne to his son Sima Dan. Emperor Kang agreed and created Sima Dan crown prince.

{"title": "Emperor Norton", "body": "Joshua Abraham Norton (c. 1819 – January 8, 1880), the self-proclaimed Imperial Majesty Emperor Norton I, was a celebrated citizen of San Francisco, California, who in 1859 proclaimed himself \"Emperor of these United States\" and subsequently \"Protector of Mexico\".\\n\\nBorn in London, Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a bequest of $40,000 from his father's estate. Norton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in Peru rice.\\n\\nAfter losing a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, Norton left San Francisco. He returned a few years later, apparently mentally unbalanced, claiming to be the emperor of the United States. Although he had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented.\\n\\nThough he was considered insane, or at least highly eccentric, the citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations, most famously, his \"order\" that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge and a tunnel to be built across San Francisco Bay (which both happened long after his death in the form of the San Francisco&nbsp;– Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube). On January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed at a street corner, and died before he could be given medical treatment. The following day, nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay homage to Norton. Norton's legacy has been immortalized in the literature of writers Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, Christopher Moore, and Neil Gaiman who based characters on him. In December 2004, a resolution was made to name the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge in honor of Norton, but the idea did not progress further.\\n\\nNorton was born in England, but scholarly works disagree as to the date and exact town of his birth. His obituary in the San Francisco Chronicle, \"following the best information obtainable\", cited the silver plate on his coffin which said he was \"aged about 65\", suggesting that 1814 could be the year of his birth. Other sources claim that he was born on February 4, 1819 in London. Immigration records indicate that he was two years old in 1820 when his parents moved to South Africa. South African genealogies suggest that his parents were John Norton (d. August 1848) and Sarah Norden. Sarah was a daughter of Abraham Norden and a sister of Benjamin Norden, a successful Jewish merchant.\\n\\nNorton emigrated from South Africa to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a bequest of $40,000 from his father's estate. He enjoyed a good deal of success in the real estate market and by the early 1850s had accumulated a fortune of $250,000. Norton thought he saw a business opportunity when China, facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of rice, causing the price of rice in San Francisco to skyrocket from four cents per pound to thirty-six cents per pound (9 cents/kg to 79 cents/kg). When he heard that the Glyde, which was returning from Peru, was carrying  of rice, he bought the entire shipment for $25,000 (or twelve and a half cents per pound), hoping to corner the market.\\n\\nShortly after he signed the contract, several other shiploads of rice arrived from Peru causing the price of rice to plummet to three cents a pound. Norton tried to void the contract, stating that the dealer had misled him as to the quality of rice to expect. From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later on, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. Norton's mental state was severely affected by these financial setbacks. He declared bankruptcy in 1858 and left the city for a time. There are no known documents noting that Norton had an eccentric personality prior to the loss of his fortune, so it is not known whether his pronounced eccentricity was a permanent aspect of his character or arose as a result of the stressful financial straits he found himself in during the 1850s. Nonetheless, after his sudden loss of financial stability, Norton became (in the absence of a proper diagnosis) somewhat \"odd\", exhibiting the symptoms often referred to as \"delusions of grandeur\".\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nWhen Norton returned to San Francisco from his self-imposed exile, he had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the vicissitudes and inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States. On September 17, 1859, he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself \"Emperor of these United States\":\\n\\n The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin. Norton would later add \"Protector of Mexico\" to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical twenty-one-year \"reign\" over America.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIn accordance with his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state. After assuming absolute control over the country, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree that formally \"dissolved\" the United States Congress. In the decree, Norton observed:\\n\\nAs a result, Norton ordered that all interested parties gather at Platt's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 so as to \"remedy the evil complained of\".\\n\\nIn another imperial decree a month later, Norton summoned the army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress:\\n\\nNorton's orders obviously had no effect on the Army, and the Congress likewise continued in its activities unperturbed. Norton issued further decrees in 1860 that purported to dissolve the republic and to forbid the assembly of any members of the Congress. Norton's battle against the elected leaders of America was to persist throughout what he considered his reign, though it appears that Norton eventually, if somewhat grudgingly, accepted that Congress would continue to exist without his permission, although this did not change his feelings on the matter. In the hopes of resolving the many disputes between citizens of the United States during the Civil War, Norton issued a mandate in 1862 ordering both the Roman Catholic Church and Protestant churches to publicly ordain him as \"Emperor\".\\n\\nHis attempts to overthrow the elected government of America by force having been utterly ignored, Norton turned his attention and his proclamations to other matters, both political and social. On August 12, 1869, \"being desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing within our realm\", he abolished both the Democratic and Republican parties. The failure to refer to Norton's adopted home city with appropriate respect was the subject of a particularly stern edict in 1872:\\n\\nFor all of his quirks and regardless of the precise nature of his psychological condition, Norton was on some occasions a visionary, and a number of his \"Imperial Decrees\" exhibited a profound foresight. Among his many edicts were instructions to form a League of Nations, and he explicitly forbade any form of discord or conflict between religions or their sects. Norton also saw fit on a number of occasions to decree the construction of a suspension bridge or tunnel connecting Oakland and San Francisco, his later decrees becoming increasingly irritated at the lack of prompt obedience being exhibited by the authorities:\\n\\nThis suggestion, unlike many of Norton's others, actually came to fruition, but not because of him; construction of the San Francisco&nbsp;– Oakland Bay Bridge began on July 9, 1933 and was completed on November 12, 1936. The construction of Bay Area Rapid Transit's Transbay Tube was completed in 1969, with Transbay rail service commencing in 1974.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nNorton spent his days as emperor inspecting the streets of San Francisco in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulets, given to him by officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or an umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot at the time.\\n\\nIt was during one of his inspections that Norton is reputed to have performed one of his most famous acts of \"diplomacy.\" During the 1860s and 1870s, there were a number of anti-Chinese demonstrations in the poorer districts of San Francisco. Ugly riots, some resulting in fatalities, broke out on several occasions. During one such incident, Norton allegedly positioned himself between the rioters and their Chinese targets, and with a bowed head started reciting the Lord's Prayer repeatedly until the rioters dispersed without incident.\\n\\nNorton was much loved and revered by the citizens of San Francisco. Although penniless, he regularly ate at the finest restaurants in San Francisco; these restaurateurs then took it upon themselves to add brass plaques in their entrances declaring \"[b]y Appointment to his Imperial Majesty, Emperor Norton I of the United States.\" By all accounts, such \"Imperial seals of approval\" were much prized and a substantial boost to trade. Supposedly, no play or musical performance in San Francisco would dare to open without reserving balcony seats for Norton.\\n\\nA popular rumor started by the devoted Norton caricaturist Ed Jump holds that he had two dogs, Bummer and Lazarus, who were themselves notable San Francisco celebrities at the time. Although he did not own the dogs, Norton ate at free lunch counters where he provided the dogs with a few morsels of food.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIn 1867, a police officer named Armand Barbier arrest Norton for the purpose of committing him to involuntary treatment for a mental disorder. The arrest outraged the citizens of San Francisco and sparked a number of scathing editorials in the newspapers. Police Chief Patrick Crowley speedily rectified matters by ordering Norton released and issuing a formal apology on behalf of the police force. Chief Crowley observed of the self-styled monarch \"that he had shed no blood; robbed no one; and despoiled no country; which is more than can be said of his fellows in that line.\" Norton was magnanimous enough to grant an \"Imperial Pardon\" to the errant young police officer. Possibly as a result of this scandal, all police officers of San Francisco thereafter saluted Norton as he passed in the street.\\n\\nNorton did receive some small tokens of formal recognition for his self-claimed position: the 1870 U.S. census records Joshua Norton as 50 years old and residing at 624 Commercial Street; his occupation is given as \"Emporer\". Norton would also issue his own money on occasion in order to pay for certain debts, and this became an accepted local currency in San Francisco. Typically these notes came in denominations ranging anywhere from fifty cents to ten dollars; the few notes still extant are collector's items. The city of San Francisco also honored Norton. When his uniform began to look shabby, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, with a great deal of ceremony, bought him a suitably regal replacement. In return, Norton sent them a gracious note of thanks and issued a \"patent of nobility in perpetuity\" for each supervisor.\\n\\nDuring the later years of Norton's \"reign\", he was the subject of considerable rumor and speculation. One popular story suggested that he was the son of Emperor Louis Napoleon and that his claim of coming from South Africa was a ruse to prevent persecution. Another popular story suggested that Norton was planning to marry the already married Queen Victoria. While this claim is unsupported, Norton did write to the Queen on several occasions and he is reported to have met Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy—only affecting poverty because he was miserly.\\n\\nA number of decrees that were probably fraudulent were submitted and duly printed in local newspapers, and it is believed that in at least a few cases, newspaper editors themselves drafted fictitious edicts to suit their own agendas. The Museum of the City of San Francisco maintains a list of the decrees believed to be genuine.\\n\\nOn the evening of January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed on the corner of California Street and Dupont Street (now Grant Avenue) in front of Old St. Mary's Church while on his way to a lecture at the California Academy of Sciences. His collapse was immediately noticed and \"the police officer on the beat hastened for a carriage to convey him to the City Receiving Hospital.\" Norton died before a carriage could arrive. The following day the San Francisco Chronicle published his obituary on its front page under the headline \"Le Roi est Mort\" (\"The King is Dead\"). In a tone tinged with sadness, the article respectfully reported that, \"[o]n the reeking pavement, in the darkness of a moon-less night under the dripping rain..., Norton I, by the grace of God, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life\". The Morning Call, another leading San Francisco newspaper, published a front-page article using an almost identical sentence as a headline: \"Norton the First, by the grace of God Emperor of these United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life.\"\\n\\nIt quickly became evident that, contrary to the rumors, Norton had died in complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single sovereign, worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of hats (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master); an 1828 French franc; and a handful of the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold mine.\\n\\nInitial funeral arrangements included a pauper's coffin of simple redwood. However, members of the Pacific Club (a San Franciscan businessman's association) established a funeral fund that paid for a handsome rosewood casket and arranged a suitably dignified farewell. Norton's funeral on Sunday, January 10, was a solemn, mournful, and large affair. Respects were paid \"...by all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social outcast.\" Some accounts report that as many as 30,000 people lined the streets to pay homage, and that the funeral cortege was two miles (3 km) long. At the time San Francisco's total population was a mere 230,000. He was buried at the Masonic Cemetery, at the expense of the City of San Francisco.\\n\\nIn 1934, Norton's remains were transferred, as were all graves in the city, at the expense of the City of San Francisco to a grave site of moderate splendor at Woodlawn Cemetery, in Colma. The site is marked by a large stone inscribed \"Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico\". Adjacent to his plot is one marked for the self-declared \"Her Royal Majesty, Empress of San Francisco, José I, The Widow Norton.\"\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nAlthough details of Norton's life story may have been forgotten, he was immortalized in literature. Mark Twain, who was resident in San Francisco during part of Emperor Norton's \"reign\", modeled the character of the King in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn after Norton.\\n\\nRobert Louis Stevenson made Norton a character in his 1892 novel, The Wrecker. Stevenson's stepdaughter, Isobel Field, wrote about Norton in her autobiography entitled This Life I've Loved. She wrote that Norton \"was a gentle and kindly man, and fortunately found himself in the friendliest and most sentimental city in the world, the idea being 'let him be emperor if he wants to.' San Francisco played the game with him.\"\\n\\nOver the years Norton's eccentricity has been a continuing source of inspiration: he appears as a patron saint in the religion of Discordianism, and makes numerous appearances in popular culture.\\n\\nIn 1939, E Clampus Vitus placed a plaque on the Transbay Terminal of the San Francisco Bay Bridge commemorating Emperor Norton's \"The bridge will be built\" proclamation.thumb\\n\\nIn January 1980, numerous ceremonies were conducted in San Francisco to honor the 100th anniversary of the passing of the one and only \"Emperor of the United States.\" Norton's proclamations promoting a bridge between San Francisco and Oakland were commemorated on December 14, 2004, when after a campaign by local cartoonist Phil Frank the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a resolution calling for the new span of the San Francisco&nbsp;– Oakland Bay Bridge to be named after Norton. The proposal, however, needed the approval of the City of Oakland and then state authorities before it could be ratified. The members of the Oakland City Council expressed disapproval of the proposal, and no progress was made on the resolution afterwards.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Empire of Brazil", "body": "The Empire of Brazil was a 19th-century constitutional monarchy that broadly comprised present-day Brazil under the rule of Emperors Dom (English: Don or Lord) Pedro&nbsp;I and his son Dom Pedro&nbsp;II, both members of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: Bragança)—a branch of the thousand-year old Capetian Dynasty. A colony of the Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese colonial Empire in 1808, when the Portuguese King Dom João&nbsp;VI, in an attempt to escape from Napoleon Bonaparte's conquests in Europe, established himself and his government in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. He later returned to Portugal, leaving his eldest son and heir Pedro to rule Brazil as regent.\\n\\nOn 7 September 1822, Pedro declared the independence of Brazil and, after waging a successful war against his father's kingdom, was acclaimed on 12 October as Pedro&nbsp;I, the first Emperor of Brazil. As the head of state of a huge but sparsely-populated and ethnically-diverse empire, Pedro&nbsp;I was immediately faced with a number of obstacles: he entered into a long conflict of ideals with a sizable parliamentary faction over the role of the monarch in the government; and the unsuccessful Cisplatine War against the neighboring United Provinces of South America led to the secession of a Brazilian province (later to become Uruguay) in 1828. In 1826, despite his role in Brazilian independence, he became the king of Portugal but immediately abdicated the crown to his eldest daughter, Dona (English: Dame or Lady) Maria&nbsp;II. Two years later her throne was usurped by Pedro&nbsp;I's younger brother, Dom Miguel&nbsp;I. Unable to deal with both Brazilian and Portuguese affairs, Pedro&nbsp;I abdicated on 7 April 1831, having reigned for less than nine years, and immediately departed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.\\n\\nPedro&nbsp;I's successor was his five-year-old son, Pedro&nbsp;II. As Pedro&nbsp;II was still a minor, a weak regency was created and the power vacuum resulting from the absence of a monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro&nbsp;II, once declared of age, transformed Brazil into an emerging power on the international stage. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously-guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government: a functional, representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions.\\n\\nUnlike its neighbors, the Empire of Brazil was not troubled (even during the chaotic regency period) by dictatorships or repression of civil rights. The last four decades of Pedro&nbsp;II's reign were marked by internal peace and economic prosperity. \"So successful was Pedro&nbsp;II\", historian Roderick J. Barman has said, \"that, by the 1880s, the ruling circles took Brazil's existence as a nation-state for granted and no longer considered him to be essential as the organizer and manager of the system.\" Essentially, the monarchy was seen to have become \"redundant\". Additionally, Pedro&nbsp;II himself had no desire that the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and, as he grew older, he made no effort to maintain support for the institution. Since he lacked viable heirs (the next in line was his daughter Dona Isabel, and both Pedro&nbsp;II and the ruling classes considered a female monarch unacceptable) the Empire's political leaders believed that there was no reason to uphold the monarchy. Despite the lack of enthusiasm for a republic among most Brazilians, on 15 November 1889, after a 58-year reign, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator. The republicans' success owed far less to their accomplishments than to Pedro&nbsp;II's refusal to oppose the destruction of the Empire founded by his father.\\n\\nthumbThe territory which would come to be known as Brazil was claimed by Portugal on 22 April 1500, when the navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on its coast. Permanent settlement followed in 1532, and for the next 300 years the Portuguese slowly expanded westwards until they had reached nearly all of the borders of modern Brazil. In 1808, the army of French Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, forcing the Portuguese royal family into exile. They re-established themselves in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, which became the unofficial seat of the Portuguese Empire.\\n\\nKing Dom João&nbsp;VI returned to Portugal in April 1821, leaving behind his son and heir Prince Dom Pedro to rule Brazil as his regent. The Portuguese government then made moves toward revoking the political autonomy that Brazil had been granted beginning in 1808. The threat of losing their limited control over local affairs ignited widespread opposition among Brazilians. José Bonifácio de Andrada, along with other Brazilian leaders, convinced Pedro to declare Brazil's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822. On 12 October, the prince was acclaimed Pedro&nbsp;I, first Emperor of the newly-created Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. The declaration of independence was opposed throughout Brazil by armed military units loyal to Portugal. The ensuing war of independence was fought across the country, with battles in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers to surrender did so in March 1824, and independence was recognized by Portugal in August 1825.\\n\\nPedro&nbsp;I encountered a number of crises during his reign. A secessionist rebellion in the Brazilian province of Cisplatina in late 1825 and the subsequent attempt by the United Provinces of South America (later Argentina) to annex Cisplatina led the Empire into \"a long, inglorious, and ultimately futile war in the south\". In March 1826, João&nbsp;VI died and Pedro&nbsp;I inherited the Portuguese crown, briefly becoming King Pedro&nbsp;IV before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, Maria&nbsp;II. The situation worsened in 1828 when the war in the south ended with Brazil's loss of Cisplatina, which would become the independent republic of Uruguay. During the same year in Lisbon, Maria&nbsp;II's throne was usurped by Prince Miguel, Pedro&nbsp;I's younger brother.\\n\\nOther difficulties arose when the Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. Pedro&nbsp;I, along with a significant percentage of the legislature, argued that Brazil's constitution should specify an independent judicial branch and a legislature which was popularly elected, but presided over by a head of state (the Emperor) who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament wanted the monarch to be circumscribed to a more ceremonial role, with the legislature dominant in governance and setting policies. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by a select social clique, or by representatives of the broader citizenry, was carried into the debates (lasting from 1826 to 1831) over establishing the structure under which politics and government would operate. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugual simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, Pedro&nbsp;II on 7 April 1831, and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.\\n\\nthumbFollowing the hasty departure of Pedro&nbsp;I, Brazil was left with a five-year-old boy as head of state. With no precedent to follow, the Empire was faced with the prospect of a period of more than twelve years without a strong executive, as, under the constitution, Pedro&nbsp;II would not attain his majority and begin exercising authority as Emperor until 2 December 1843. A regency was elected to rule the country in the meantime. Because the Regency held few of the powers exercised by an emperor and was completely subordinated to the General Assembly, it could not fill the vacuum at the apex of Brazil's government.\\n\\nThe hamstrung Regency proved unable to resolve disputes and rivalries between national and local political factions. Believing that granting provincial and local governments greater autonomy would quell the growing dissension, the General Assembly passed a constitutional amendment in 1834, called the Ato Adicional (Additional Act). Instead of ending the chaos, these new powers only fed local ambitions and rivalries. Violence erupted throughout the country. Local parties competed with renewed ferocity to dominate provincial and municipal governments, as whichever party dominated the provinces would also gain control over the electoral and political system. Those parties which lost elections rebelled and tried to assume power by force.\\n\\nThe politicians who had risen to power during the 1830s had by now also become familiar with the difficulties and pitfalls of power. According to historian Roderick J. Barman, by 1840 \"they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro&nbsp;II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival.\" Some of these politicians (who would form the Conservative Party in the 1840s) believed that a neutral figure was required—one who could stand above political factions and petty interests to address discontent and moderate disputes. They envisioned an emperor who was more dependent on the legislature than the constitutional monarch envisioned by Pedro&nbsp;I, yet with greater powers than had been advocated at the beginning of the Regency by their rivals (who later formed the Liberal Party). The liberals, however, took the initiative and contrived to pass an initiative to lower Pedro&nbsp;II's age of majority from eighteen to fourteen. The Emperor was declared fit to rule in July 1840.\\n\\nthumbTo achieve their goals, the liberals had allied themselves with a group of high-ranking palace servants and notable politicians—the \"Courtier Faction\". The courtiers were part of the Emperor's inner circle and had established influence over him, which enabled the appointment of successive liberal-courtier cabinets. Their reign was short-lived, though. By 1846, Pedro&nbsp;II had matured physically and mentally. No longer an insecure 14-year-old swayed by gossip, suggestions of secret plots, and other manipulative tactics, his weaknesses faded and his strength of character came to the fore. He successfully engineered the end of the courtiers' influence by removing them from his inner circle while avoiding any public disruption. He also dismissed the liberals—who had proved ineffective while in office—and called the conservatives to the government.\\n\\nThe abilities of the Emperor and the newly-appointed conservative cabinet were tested by three crises between 1848 and 1852. The first came in confronting the trade in illegally-imported slaves. This had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with Britain. Trafficking continued unabated, however, and the British government's passage of the Aberdeen Act of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize anyone who was found to be involved in the slave trade. While Brazil grappled with this problem, the Praieira revolt erupted on 6 November 1848—a conflict between local political factions within Pernambuco province (and one in which liberal and courtier supporters were involved), the revolt was suppressed by March 1849. It was the last rebellion to occur during the monarchy, and its end marked the start of forty years of internal peace in Brazil. A bill was promulgated on 4 September 1850 giving the government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade. With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate the importation of slaves, and by 1852 this first crisis was over, with Britain accepting that the trade had been suppressed.\\n\\nThe third crisis was a conflict with the Argentine Confederation regarding ascendancy over territories adjacent to the Río de la Plata and free navigation of that waterway. Since the 1830s, Argentine dictator Don Juan Manuel de Rosas had supported rebellions within Uruguay and Brazil. The Empire was not able to address the threat posed by Rosas until 1850, when an alliance was forged between Brazil, Uruguay and disaffected Argentines, leading to the Platine War and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine ruler in February 1852. The Empire's successful navigation of these crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil emerged as a hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans came to see the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as freedom of the press and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood in stark contrast to the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.\\n\\nthumbthumbAt the beginning of the 1850s, Brazil was enjoying internal stability and economic prosperity. The nation's infrastructure was being developed, with progress on the railroad, electric telegraph and steamship lines uniting it into a single entity. After five years, the successful conservative cabinet was dismissed and on September 1853, Honório Carneiro Leão, Marquis of Paraná—the head of the Conservative Party—was charged with organizing a new cabinet. Emperor Pedro&nbsp;II wanted to advance an ambitious plan, which became known as \"the Conciliation\", aimed at strengthening parliament's role in settling the country's political disputes.\\n\\nCarneiro Leão invited several Liberals to join the Conservative ranks and went so far as to name some as ministers. The new cabinet, although highly successful, was plagued from the start by strong opposition from ultraconservative members of the Conservative Party who repudiated the new liberal recruits. They believed that the cabinet had become a political machine, that the converted liberals did not genuinely share the party's ideals and were primarily interested in gaining public offices. Despite this mistrust, Carneiro Leão showed resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks. However, in September 1856, at the height of his career, he died unexpectedly, although the cabinet survived him until May 1857.\\n\\nThe ultraconservatives were led by the Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itaboraí, Eusébio de Queirós and Paulino Soares de Sousa, 1st&nbsp;Viscount of Uruguai—all former ministers in the 1848–53 cabinet. These elder statesmen were of the same generation as the late Carneiro Leão and had taken control of the Conservative Party after his death. In the years following 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed due to the lack of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives who supported the Conciliation. The schism was not caused by the Conciliation policy; rather, in the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation of politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. These men saw their path to high office as being blocked by the conservative elders, who would not readily relinquish control.\\n\\nThe remaining members of the Liberal Party, which had languished since its fall in 1848 and the disastrous Praieira rebellion in 1849, took advantage of what seemed to be the Conservative Party's impending dissolution to return to national politics with renewed strength. They delivered a powerful blow to the government when they managed to win several seats in the Chamber of Deputies in 1860. When many moderate conservatives defected to unite with liberals to form a new political party—the \"Progressive League\"—the Conservative's hold on power became unsustainable due to the lack of a workable governing majority in the parliament. They resigned, and during May 1862, Pedro&nbsp;II named a progressive cabinet. It marked the end of fourteen years of Conservative dominance in national politics. The period had been one of peace and prosperity for Brazil: \"The political system functioned smoothly. Civil liberties were maintained. A start had been made on the introduction into Brazil of railroad, telegraph and steamship lines. The country was no longer troubled by the disputes and conflicts that had racked it during its first thirty years.\"\\n\\nthumbthumbThis period of calm came to an end when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro nearly sparked a war between Great Britain and Brazil. He sent an ultimatum containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862. The Brazilian government refused to yield, and the consul issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared itself for the imminent conflict, and coastal defenses were given permission to fire upon any British warship that tried to capture Brazilian merchant ships. The Brazilian government then severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.\\n\\nAs war with the British Empire threatened, Brazil had to turn its attention to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay which pitted its political parties against one another. The internal conflict led to the murder of Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. Brazil's Progressive Cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War. The dictator of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the Uruguayan situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a regional power. In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized (triggering the Paraguayan War) and then invaded Brazil.\\n\\nWhat had appeared at the outset to be a brief and straightforward military intervention led to a full-scale war in South America's southeast. However, the possibility of a two-front conflict (with Britain and Paraguay) faded when, in September 1865, the British government sent an envoy who publicly apologized for the crisis between the empires. The Paraguayan invasion in 1864 led to a conflict far longer than expected, and faith in the progressive cabinet's ability to prosecute the war vanished. Also, from its inception, the Progressive League was plagued by internal conflict between factions formed by former moderate conservatives and by former liberals.\\n\\nThe cabinet resigned and the Emperor named the aging Viscount of Itaboraí to head a new cabinet in July 1868, marking the return of the conservatives to power. This impelled both progressive wings to set aside their differences, leading them to rechristen their party as the Liberal Party. A third, smaller and radical progressive wing would declare itself republican in 1870—an ominous signal to the monarchy. Nonetheless, the \"ministry formed by the viscount of Itaboraí was a far abler body than the cabinet it replaced\" and the conflict with Paraguay ended in March 1870 with total victory for Brazil and its allies. More than 50,000 Brazilian soldiers had died, and war costs were eleven times the government's annual budget. However, the country was so prosperous that the government was able to retire the war debt in only ten years. The conflict was also a stimulus to national production and economic growth.\\n\\nthumbThe diplomatic victory over the British Empire and the military victory over Uruguay in 1865, followed by the successful conclusion of the war with Paraguay in 1870, marked the beginning of the \"golden age\" of the Brazilian Empire. The Brazilian economy grew rapidly; railroad, shipping and other modernization projects were started; immigration flourished. The Empire became known internationally as a modern and progressive nation, second only to the United States in the Americas; it was a politically stable economy with a good investment potential.\\n\\nIn March 1871, Pedro&nbsp;II named the conservative José Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco as the head of a cabinet whose main goal was to pass a law to immediately free all children born to female slaves. The controversial bill was introduced in the Chamber of Deputies in May and faced \"a determined opposition, which commanded support from about one third of the deputies and which sought to organize public opinion against the measure.\" The bill was finally promulgated in September and became known as the \"Law of the Free Birth\". Rio Branco's success, however, seriously damaged the long-term political stability of the Empire. The law \"split the conservatives down the middle, one party faction backed the reforms of the Rio Branco Cabinet, while the second—known as the escravocratas [slavocrats]—were unrelenting in their opposition\", forming a new generation of ultraconservatives.\\n\\nThe \"Law of Free Birth\", and Pedro&nbsp;II's support for it, resulted in the loss of the ultraconservatives' unconditional loyalty to the monarchy. The Conservative Party had experienced serious divisions before, during the 1850s, when the Emperor's total support for the conciliation policy had given rise to the Progressives. The ultraconservatives led by Eusébio, Uruguai and Itaboraí who opposed conciliation in the 1850s had nonetheless believed that the Emperor was indispensable to the functioning of the political system: the Emperor was an ultimate and impartial arbiter when political deadlock threatened. By contrast, this new generation of ultraconservatives had no experience of the Regency and early years of Pedro&nbsp;II's reign, when external and internal dangers had threatened the Empire's very existence; they had only known prosperity, peace and a stable administration. To them—and to the ruling classes in general—the presence of a neutral monarch who could settle political disputes was no longer important. Furthermore, since Pedro&nbsp;II had clearly taken a political side in the slavery question, he had compromised his position as a neutral arbiter. The young ultraconservative politicians saw no reason to uphold or defend the Imperial office.\\n\\nthumbThe weaknesses in the monarchy took many years to become apparent. Brazil continued to prosper during the 1880s, with the economy and society both developing rapidly, including the first organized push for women's rights. By contrast, letters written by Pedro&nbsp;II reveal a man grown world-weary with age, increasingly alienated from current events and pessimistic in outlook. He remained meticulous in performing his formal duties as Emperor, albeit often without enthusiasm, but he no longer actively intervened to maintain stability in the country. His increasing \"indifference towards the fate of the regime\" and his inaction to protect the imperial system once it came under threat have led historians to attribute the \"prime, perhaps sole, responsibility\" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the emperor himself.\\n\\nThe lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for the nation also threatened the long-term prospects for the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor's heir was his eldest daughter, Dona Isabel, who had no interest in, nor expectation of, becoming the monarch. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still a very traditional, male-dominated society, and the prevailing view was that only a male monarch would be capable as head of state. Pedro&nbsp;II, the ruling circles and the wider political establishment all considered a female successor to be inappropriate, and Pedro&nbsp;II himself believed that the death of his two sons and the lack of a male heir were a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. A weary Emperor who no longer cared for the throne, an heir who had no desire to assume the crown, an increasingly discontent ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve that appeared within the Army ranks.\\n\\nRepublicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favoured a dictatorial republic, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination at the beginning of the 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor and the politicians showed themselves to be respectively uninterested or incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.\\n\\nthumbThe nation enjoyed considerable international prestige during the final years of the Empire and had become an emerging power within the international arena. On 13 May 1888—while Pedro&nbsp;II was receiving medical treatment in Europe—Princess Isabel, after the bill was passed by the parliament, signed the law (which became known as Golden Law) that completely abolished slavery in Brazil. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery proved to be unfounded. Nonetheless, the end of slavery was the final blow to any remaining belief in the crown's neutrality, and this resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by the ultraconservatives—themselves backed by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country.\\n\\nTo avert a republican backlash, the government exploited the ready credit available to Brazil as a result of its prosperity. It made available massive loans at favorable interest rates to plantation owners and lavishly granted titles and lesser honors to curry favor with influential political figures who had become disaffected. The government also indirectly began to address the problem of the recalcitrant military by revitalizing the moribund National Guard, by then an entity which existed mostly only on paper.\\n\\nThe measures taken by the government alarmed civilian republicans and the positivists in the military. The republicans saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. The reorganization of the National Guard was begun by the cabinet in August 1889, and the creation of a rival force caused the dissidents among the officer corps to consider desperate measures. For both groups, republicans and military, it had become a case of \"now or never\". Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government, republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy.\\n\\nThe Positivists launched a coup and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that \"Rarely has a revolution been so minor.\" Throughout the coup Pedro&nbsp;II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions put forward by politicians and military leaders for quelling the rebellion. The Emperor and his family were sent into exile on 17 November. Although there was significant monarchist reaction after the fall of the Empire, this was thoroughly repressed, and neither Pedro&nbsp;II nor his daughter supported a restoration. Despite being unaware of the plans for a coup, once it occurred and in light of the Emperor's passive acceptance of the situation, the political establishment supported the end of the monarchy in favor of a republic. They were unaware that the goal of the coup's leaders was the creation of a dictatorial republic rather than a presidential or parliamentary republic.\\n\\nthumbArticle 2 of Brazil's Constitution held both the Emperor and the Assembléia Geral (General Assembly or Parliament), which in 1824 was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, as the nation's representatives. This endowed the Assembly with both status and authority. The Constitution created legislative, moderating, executive and judicial branches as \"delegations of the nation\" with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined.\\n\\nThe prerogatives and authority granted to the legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in the functioning of the government—it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article 13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct.\\n\\nRegarding matters of foreign policy, the Constitution (under Article 102) required that the General Assembly be consulted about declarations of war, treaties and the conduct of international relations. A determined legislator could exploit these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments and force reconsideration of policies.\\n\\nDuring its annual four-month sessions the Assembly conducted public debates. These were widely reported and formed a national forum for the expression of public concerns from all parts of the country. It was frequently a venue for expressing opposition to policies and airing grievances. Legislators enjoyed immunity from prosecution for speeches made from the floor and in the discharge of their offices. Only their own chambers within the Assembly could order the arrest of a member during his tenure. \"With no actual responsibility for the actual conduct of affairs, the legislators were free to propose sweeping reforms, advocate ideal solutions, and denounce compromising and opportunistic conduct by the government.\"\\n\\nthumbThe Emperor was the head of both the moderating and executive branches (being aided by the Council of State and the Council of Ministers, respectively); he had the final say and held ultimate control over the national government. He was tasked with ensuring national independence and stability. The Constitution (Article 101) gave him very few avenues for imposing his will upon the General Assembly. His main recourse was the right to dissolve or extend legislative sessions. In the Senate, an emperor's authority to nominate senators did not necessarily give him added influence since senators held their offices for life and were thus freed from government pressure once confirmed. On those occasions when the Chamber of Deputies was dissolved, new elections were required to be held immediately and the new Chamber seated. \"This power was effective when held in reserve as a threat. It could not be employed repeatedly, nor would its use work to the emperor's advantage.\"\\n\\nDuring the reign of Pedro&nbsp;I the Chamber of Deputies was never dissolved and legislative sessions were never extended or postponed. Under Pedro&nbsp;II, the Chamber of Deputies was only ever dissolved at the request of the President of the Council of Ministers (Prime minister). There were eleven dissolutions during Pedro&nbsp;II's reign and, of these, ten occurred after consultation with the Council of State, which was beyond what was required by the Constitution. A Constitutional balance of power existed between the General Assembly and the executive branch under the Emperor. The legislature could not operate alone and the monarch could not force his will upon the Assembly. The system functioned smoothly only when both Assembly and Emperor acted in a spirit of cooperation for the national good.\\n\\nA new element was added when the office of \"President of the Council of Ministers\" was officially created in 1847—although it had existed in practice since 1843. The president of the Council owed his position to both his party and to the Emperor and these could sometimes come into conflict. 19th-century abolitionist leader and historian Joaquim Nabuco said that the \"President of the Council in Brazil was no Russian Chancellor, Sovereign's creature, nor a British Prime Minister, made only by the trust of the [House of] Commons: the delegation of the Crown was to him as necessary and important as the delegation of the Chamber, and, to exert with safety his functions, he had to dominate the caprice, the oscillations and ambitions of the Parliament, as well as to preserve always unalterable the favor, the good will of the emperor.\"\\n\\nthumbthumbthumbWhen enacted in 1824, the Imperial Constitution created the Conselho Geral de Província (Provincial General Council), the legislatures of the provinces. These councils were composed of either 21 or 13 elected members, depending on the size of a province's population. All \"resolutions\" (laws) created by the councils required approved by the General Assembly, with no right of appeal. Provincial Councils also had no authority to raise revenues, and their budgets had be to be debated and ratified by the General Assembly. Provinces had no autonomy and were entirely subsidiary to the national government.\\n\\nWith the 1834 constitutional amendment known as the Additional Act, Provincial General Councils were supplanted by the Assembleia Legislativa Provincial (Provincial Legislative Assemblies). The new Assemblies enjoyed much greater autonomy from the national government. A Provincial Assembly was composed of 36, 28 or 20 elected deputies, the number depending on the size of the province's population. The election of provincial deputies followed the same procedure as used to elect general deputies to the national Chamber of Deputies.\\n\\nThe responsibilities of the Provincial Assembly included defining provincial and municipal budgets and levying the taxes necessary to support them; providing primary and secondary schools (higher education was the responsibility of the national government); oversight and control of provincial and municipal expenditures; and providing for law enforcement and maintenance of police forces. The Assemblies also controlled the creation and abolishment of, and salaries for, positions within provincial and municipal civil services. The nomination, suspension and dismissal of civil servants was reserved for the president (governor) of the province, but how and under what circumstances he could exercise these prerogatives was delineated by the Assembly. The expropriation of private property (with due monetary compensation) for provincial or municipal interests was also a right of the Assembly. In effect, the Provincial Assembly could enact any kind of law—with no ratification by Parliament—so long as it did not violate or encroach upon the Constitution. However, it was not permitted to legislate in the areas of criminal law, criminal procedure laws, civil rights and obligations, the armed forces, the national budget or matters concerning national interests, e.g. foreign relations.\\n\\nThe provincial presidents were appointed by the national government and, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, they had little power or influence. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province in which they had no political, family or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to a period in office of only a few months. As the president usually spent a great deal of time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political manoeuvring.\\n\\nThe Câmara Municipal (Municipal Chamber) was the legislative body in towns and cities and had existed in Brazil since the beginning of the colonial period in the 16th-century. The Chamber was composed of vereadores (councilmen), the number of which depended on the size of the town. Unlike the Provincial General Council, the Constitution gave Municipal Chambers great autonomy. However, when the Provincial Assembly replaced the Provincial General Council in 1834, many of the powers of Municipal Chambers (including the setting of municipal budgets, oversight of expenditures, creation of jobs, and the nomination of civil servants) were transferred to the provincial government. Additionally, any laws enacted by the Municipal Chamber had to be ratified by the Provincial Assembly—but not by Parliament. While the 1834 Additional Act granted greater autonomy to the provinces from the central government, it transferred such autonomy as the towns possessed to the provincial governments. There was no office of mayor, and towns were governed by a Municipal Chamber and its president (who was the councilman who won the most votes during elections).\\n\\nthumbthumbUntil 1881, voting was mandatory and elections occurred in two stages. In the first phase voters chose electors who then selected a slate of senatorial candidates. The Emperor would choose a new senator (member of the Senate, the upper house in the General Assembly) from a list of the three candidates who had received the highest number of votes. The Electors also chose the General Deputies (members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house), provincial deputies (members of the Provincial Assemblies) and councilmen (members of the Municipal Chambers) without the involvement of the Emperor in making a final selection. All men over the age of 25 with an annual income of at least Rs 100$000 (the equivalent in 1824 to $98.00 U.S.) were eligible to vote in the first phase. The voting age was lowered to 21 for married men. To become an elector it was necessary to have an annual income of at least Rs 200$000.\\n\\nThe Brazilian system was relatively democratic for a period during which indirect elections were common in democracies. The income requirement was much higher in the United Kingdom, even after the reforms of 1832. At the time the only nations not requiring a minimum level of income as a qualification for voting were France and Switzerland where universal suffrage was introduced only in 1848. It is probable that no European country at the time had such liberal legislation as Brazil. The income requirement was low enough that any employed male citizen could qualify to vote. As an illustration the lowest paid civil employee in 1876 was a janitor who earned Rs 600$000 annually.\\n\\nMost voters in Brazil had a low income. In 1876, for example, in the town of Formiga in the province of Minas Gerais the poor constituted 70% of the electorate and in Irajá in the province of Rio de Janeiro, they were 87%. Former slaves could not vote, but their children and grandchildren could as could the illiterate (which few countries allowed). In 1872, 10.8% of the Brazilian population voted (13% if not taken in consideration the slave population). By comparison, electoral participation in the UK in 1870 was 7% of the total population; in Italy it was 2%; in Portugal 9%; and in the Netherlands 2.5%. In 1832, the year of the British electoral reform, 3% of the British voted. Further reforms in 1867 and 1884 expanded electoral participation in the UK to 15%.\\n\\nAlthough electoral fraud was common, it was not ignored by emperors, politicians or observers of the time. The problem was considered a major issue and attempts were made to correct abuses,  with legislation (including the electoral reforms of 1855, 1875 and 1881) repeatedly being enacted to combat fraud. The 1881 reforms brought significant changes: it eliminated the two-stage electoral system, introduced direct and facultative voting, and allowed the votes of former slaves and enfranchised non-Catholics. Conversely, illiterate citizens were no longer allowed to vote. Participation in elections dropped from 13% to only 0.8% in 1886. In 1889, about 15% of the Brazilian population could read and write, so disenfranchising the illiterate does not solely explain the sudden fall in voting percentages. The discontinuation of mandatory voting and voter apathy may have been significant factors contributing to the reduction in the number of voters.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumbUnder Articles 102 and 148 of the Constitution, the Brazilian Armed Forces were subordinate to the Emperor as Commander-in-Chief. He was aided by the Ministers of War and Navy in matters concerning the Army and the Armada (Navy)—although the President of the Council of Ministers usually exercised oversight of both branches in practice. The ministers of War and Navy were, with few exceptions, civilians.\\n\\nThe military was organized along similar lines to the British and American armed forces of the time, in which a small standing army could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's first line of defense relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. As a matter of policy, the military was to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in political decisions.\\n\\nMilitary personnel were allowed to run for and serve in political office while remaining on active duty. However they did not represent the Army or the Armada, but were instead expected to serve the interests of the city or province which had elected them. Pedro&nbsp;I chose nine military officers as Senators and appointed five (out of fourteen) to the Council of State. During the Regency, two were named to the Senate and none to the Council of State (this body was dormant during the Regency). Pedro&nbsp;II chose four officers as Senators during the 1840s, two in the 1850s and three others during the remaining years of his reign. He also appointed seven officers to be State Councilors during the 1840s and 1850s, and three others after that.\\n\\nThe Brazilian Armed Forces were created in the aftermath of Independence. They were originally composed of Brazilian- and Portuguese-born officers and troops who had remained loyal to the government in Rio de Janeiro during the war of secession from Portugal. Mercenaries were hired to strengthen both the Army and the Armada from their inception in 1822, a practice which continued until 1831, when all battalions of foreigners were disbanded. An artillery regiment of foreign mercenaries was later hired during the Platine War in 1851, but subsequently all military units were composed entirely of nationals. The Armed Forces were crucial to the successful outcomes of international conflicts faced by the Empire, starting with Independence (1822–1824), followed by the Cisplatine War (1825–28), then the Platine War (1851–52), the Uruguayan War (1864–65) and, finally, the Paraguayan (1864–70). They also played a part in quelling rebellions, beginning with the Confederation of the Equator (1824) under Pedro&nbsp;I, followed by the uprisings during Pedro&nbsp;II's early reign (these latter included the War of Tatters (1835–45), Cabanagem (1835–40), Balaiada (1838–41), among others).\\n\\nThe Armada was constantly being modernized with the latest developments in naval warfare. It adopted steam navigation in the 1830s, ironclad plate armor in the 1860s, and torpedoes in the 1880s. By 1889, Brazil had the fifth or sixth most powerful navy in the world and the most powerful battleships in the western hemisphere. The Army, despite its highly-experienced and battle-hardened officer corps, was plagued during peacetime by units which were badly paid, inadequately equipped, poorly trained and thinly spread across the vast Empire.\\n\\nDissention resulting from inadequate government attention to Army needs was restrained under the generation of officers who had begun their careers during the 1820s. These officers were loyal to the monarchy, believed the military should be under civilian control, and abhorred the caudillism (Hispanic-American dictatorships) against which they had fought. But by the early 1880s, this generation (including commanders such as the Duke of Caxias, the Count of Porto Alegre, and the Marquis of Erval) had died, were retired, or no longer exercised direct command.\\n\\nDissatisfaction became more evident during the 1880s, and some officers began to display open insubordination. The Emperor and the politicians did nothing to improve the military nor meet their demands. The dissemination of Positivist ideology among young officers brought further complications, as Positivism opposed the monarchy in the belief that a dictatorial republic would bring improvements. A coalition between a mutinous Army faction and the Positivist camp was formed and directly led to the republican coup on 15 November 1889. Battalions and even full regiments of soldiers loyal to the Empire, who shared the ideals of the older generation of leaders, attempted to restore the monarchy. Attempts at a restoration proved futile and supporters of the Empire were executed, arrested or forcibly retired.\\n\\nthumbUpon independence from Portugal, the immediate focus of Brazil's foreign policy was to gain widespread international recognition. The first nation to recognize Brazilian sovereignty was the United States, in May 1825. Other nations followed in establishing diplomatic relations over the next few years. Portugal recognized the separation in August 1825. The Brazilian government subsequently made it a priority to establish its international borders through treaties with its neighbors—most of them Hispanic-American republics. The task of securing recognized frontiers was complicated by the fact that, between 1777 and 1801, Portugal and Spain had annulled their previous treaties setting out the borders between their American colonial empires. However, the Empire was able to sign several bilateral treaties with neighbors, including Uruguay (in 1851), Peru (in 1851 and 1874), the Republic of New Granada (later Colombia, in 1853), Venezuela (in 1859), Bolivia (in 1867) and Paraguay (in 1872). By 1889, most of its borders were firmly established, with the remaining issues being finally resolved only after Brazil became a republic.\\n\\nA number of conflicts occurred between the Empire and its neighbors. Brazil experienced no serious conflicts with her neighbours to the north and west, due to the buffer of almost the impenetrable and sparsely populated Amazonian rainforest. In the south, however, the colonial disputes inherited from Portugal and Spain over the control of the navigable rivers and plains which formed the frontiers continued after independence. The lack of mutually-agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the Paraguayan War.\\n\\nBy the early 1870s, the international reputation of the Empire of Brazil had improved considerably, and it remained well-regarded internationally until its end in 1889. Christopher Columbus Andrews, an American diplomat in the Brazilian capital in the 1880s, later recalled Brazil as an \"important Empire\" in his memoirs. In 1871, Brazil was invited to arbitrate the dispute between the United States and Britain which became known as Alabama Claims. In 1880, the Empire acted as arbiter between the United States and France over the damage caused to U.S. nationals during the French intervention in Mexico. In 1884, Brazil was called upon to arbitrate between Chile and several other nations (France, Italy, Britain, Germany, Belgium, Austria-Hungary and Switzerland) over damages arising from the War of the Pacific.\\n\\nThe Brazilian government eventually felt confident enough to negotiate a trade deal with the United States in 1889, the first to be undertaken with any nation since the disastrous and exploitative trade treaty with Britain in 1826 (canceled in 1844). American historian Steven C. Topik said that Pedro&nbsp;II's \"quest for a trade treaty with the United States was part of a grander strategy to increase national sovereignty and autonomy.\" Unlike the circumstances of the previous pact, the Empire was in a strong position to insist on favorable trade terms, as negotiations occurred during a time of Brazilian domestic prosperity and international prestige.\\n\\nthumbthumb\\n\\nThe unit of currency under the Empire and until 1942 was the real (\"royal\"), plural réis (or reais in modern Portuguese), and was derived from the Portuguese real. It was usually called milréis (English: thousand royals) and written as 1$000. A thousand milréis (1:000$000)—or one million réis—was known as conto de réis.\" One conto de réis was represented by the symbol Rs written before the value and by a dollar sign separating the units group (lower than 1,000 réis). Thus, 350 réis was written as \"Rs 350\"; 1,712 réis as \"Rs 1$712\"; and 1,020,800 réis was written as \"Rs 1:020$800\". This means that the colon functioned as the millions comma and the $ sign as the thousands comma; the colon is the actual group separator and the $ sign is used only for separating the smaller group of units.\\n\\nthumbthumbthumbthumbBrazil's international trade reached a total value of Rs 79.000:000$000 between 1834 and 1839. This continued to increase every year until it reached Rs 472.000:000$000 between 1886 and 1887: an annual growth rate of 3.88% since 1839. The absolute value of exports from the Empire in 1850 was the highest in Latin America and triple that of Argentina which was in fourth place. Brazil would keep its high standing in exports and general economic growth until the end of the monarchy. Brazilian economic expansion, especially after 1850, compared well with that of the United States and European nations. The national revenue amounted to Rs 11.795:000$000 in 1831 and rose to Rs 160.840:000$000 in 1889. By 1858, national tax revenues ranked as the eighth-largest in the world. To give an idea of the economic potential of the country during the Empire the Barsa Encyclopedia calculated that \"[if] it had been able to sustain the level of productivity achieved in 1780 and managed to increase exports at a pace equal to that verified in the second half of the 19th-century, its per capita income in 1950 would be comparable to the average per capita income of the Western Europe nations\". Imperial Brazil was, despite its progress, a country where wealth was very unequally distributed. However, for purposes of comparison, according to historian Steven C. Topik, in the United States, \"by 1890, 80 percent of the population lived on the margin of subsistence, while 20 percent controlled almost all wealth.\"\\n\\nAs new technologies appeared, and with increases in internal productivity, exports increased considerably. This made it possible to reach equilibrium in the balance of trade. During the 1820s sugar constituted about 30% of total exports while cotton constituted 21%, coffee 18% and leather and skins 14%. Twenty years later coffee would reach 42%, sugar 27%, leather and skins 9%, and cotton 8% of the total exports. This did not mean a reduction in the production of these any of these items and, in fact, the opposite occurred. Growth occurred in all sectors, some more than others. In this period of twenty years, Fausto says \"Brazilian exports had doubled in volume and had tripled in nominal value\" while the valuation denominated in Pounds sterling increased by over 40%. Brazil was not the only country were agriculture played an important role on exports. Around 1890, in the United States, by then the richest nation in the Americas, agricultural goods represented 80% of all its exports.\\n\\nIn the 1820s, Brazil exported 11,000 tons of cacao and by 1880 this had increased to 73,500 tons. Between 1821 and 1825, 41,174 tons of sugar were exported, rising to 238,074 tons between 1881 and 1885. Until 1850, rubber production was insignificant, but between 1881 and 1890, it had reached third place among Brazilian exports. This was about 81 tons between 1827 and 1830 reaching 1,632 tons in 1852. By 1900 the country was exporting 24,301,452 tons of rubber. Brazil also exported around 3,377,000 tons of coffee between 1821 and 1860 while between 1861 and 1889 this reached 6,804,000 tons. Technological innovations also contributed to the growth of exports,, in particular the adoption of steam navigation and railroad allowed for faster and more convenient cargo transportation.\\n\\nDevelopment on an immense scale occurred during this period, anticipating similar advancements in European countries. In 1850, there were fifty factories valued at more than Rs 7.000:000$000. At the end of the Imperial period in 1889, Brazil had 636 factories representing an annual rate of increase of 6.74% from 1850 and valued at approximately Rs 401.630:600$000 with an annual growth rate of 10.94% since 1850. The \"countryside echoed with the clang of iron track being laid as railroads were constructed at the most furious pace of the nineteenth century; indeed, building in 1880s was the second greatest in absolute terms in Brazil's entire history. Only eight countries in the entire world laid more track in the decade than Brazil.\" The first railroad line, with only , was opened on 30 April 1854 at a time when many European countries had no rail service. By 1868, there were  of railroad lines, and by the end of the Empire in 1889 this had grown to  with another  under construction making it the country with \"the largest rail network in Latin America\".\\n\\nFactories were constructed throughout the Empire in the 1880s, allowing Brazil's cities to be modernized and \"receive the benefits of gas, electrical, sanitation, telegraph and tram companies. Brazil was entering the modern world.\" It was the fifth country in the world to install modern city sewers, the third to have sewage treatment and one of the pioneers in the installation of a telephone service. In addition to the foregoing improvements to infrastructure, it was also the first South American nation to adopt public electric lighting (in 1883) and the second in the Americas (behind the United States) to establish a transatlantic telegraph line connecting it directly to Europe in 1874. The first domestic telegraph line appeared during 1852 in Rio de Janeiro. By 1889, there were  of telegraph lines connecting the country's capital to distant Brazilian provinces such as Pará and even linking to other South American countries such as Argentina and Uruguay.\\n\\nthumbEver since the second half of the 18th-century, when Brazil was still a colony, the government had attempted to gather data regarding the population. However, few captaincies (later called provinces) collected the requested information. After independence the government instituted a commission for statistics in a decree of 1829 with a mandate to hold a national census. The commission was a failure and was disbanded in 1834. In the ensuing years, provincial governments were tasked with collecting census information but their census reports were often incomplete or not done at all. In 1851, another attempt at a nationwide census failed when rioting broke out. This was the result of the erroneous belief among Brazilians of mixed-race descent that the survey was a subterfuge designed to enslave anyone having African blood.\\n\\nThe first true national census with exhaustive and broad coverage was carried out in 1872. It showed Brazil as having a total population of 9,930,478 inhabitants. Estimates made by the government in prior decades showed 4,000,000 inhabitants in 1823 and gave a figure of 7,000,700 in 1854. The population was distributed across 20 provinces and one neutral district (the Empire's capital) with 641 municipalities and 1,473 smaller towns. The small population and small number of towns revealed an enormous but sparsely populated country.\\n\\nAmong the free population 23.4% of males and 13.4% of females were considered literate. Men represented 52% (5,123,869) of the total population. Figures for the population by age showed 24.6% were children between the ages of 0 and 10; 21.1% were adolescents and young men between 11 and 20; 32.9% were adults between 21 and 40; 8.4% were between 41 and 50; 12.8% were between 51 and 70; and lastly, only 3.4% were over 71. The northeast region and the southeast region together held 87.2% of the total population.\\n\\nThe second national census was held in 1890 when the Brazilian republic was only a few months old. Its results showed that the population had grown in the meantime to 14,333,915 inhabitants.\\n\\nthumbFour ethnic groups were recognized in Imperial Brazil: white, black, Indian and pardo. The pardo (English: brown) was a designation for multiracial Brazilians which is still officially used, though some scholars prefer the term mestiço (English: mixed one). The term denotes a broad category which includes caboclo (descendants of whites and Indians), mulatto (descendants of whites and blacks) and cafuso (descendants of blacks and Indians).\\n\\nThe caboclos formed the majority of the population in the Northern, Northeastern and Central-Western regions. A large mulatto population inhabited the eastern coast of the northeastern region from Bahia to Paraíba and were also present in northern Maranhão, southern Minas Gerais, eastern Rio de Janeiro and in Espírito Santo. The cafuso were the smallest and most difficult to distinguish from the two other mixed-race subgroups since the descendants of caboclos and mulattoes interbreeding also fall into this category and were found in the northeast sertão (English: backcountry). These groups may still be found in the same areas today.\\n\\nWhite Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spanish and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan Africa ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or pardo. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.\\n\\nBecause of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th-century Brazil developed as a multi–ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. Historian Afrânio Peixoto reported that the population of 1835 was made up of 24.1% whites, 18.2% pardos, 51.4% blacks and an unknown number of Indians. In 1872, there were 38.1% whites, 38.4% pardos, 16.5% blacks and 7% Indians. By 1890 the figures were 44% whites, 32% pardos, 12% blacks and 12% Indians. The main issue regarding this data is that the author does not say what sources were used in obtaining the statistics.\\n\\nAn unofficial estimate made by the explorer Alexander von Humboldt in 1825 reveals a nation with 920,000 whites, 1,960,000 blacks and 1,120,000 pardos and Indians out of a total population of 4 million inhabitants in that year. A rough calculation made by another person in 1830 argued that there were 71.3% whites and caboclos and 28.9% blacks but did not detail which group included those of white and black descent. The traveler Johann Moritz Rugendas believed that in 1835 there were 854,000 whites, 648,000 pardos and 1,987,000 blacks.\\n\\nThe first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% pardos, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% pardos, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians.\\n\\nthumbPrior to 1808, the Portuguese were the only European people to settle Brazil in significant numbers. Although British, Germans, Italians and Spanish had previously immigrated to Brazil, they had only done so as a small number of individuals or in very small groups. These earliest non-Portuguese settlers did not have a significant impact on the culture of Portugal's Brazilian colony. The situation changed after the Portuguese Royal Family came to Brazil in 1808. The Prince Regent João (later King João&nbsp;VI) began to encourage immigration from European countries outside Portugal.\\n\\nThe first to arrive in numbers were the Swiss, of whom some 2,000 settled in Rio de Janeiro province during 1818. They were followed by Germans and Irish, who immigrated to Brazil in the 1820s. German settlers gravitated mostly to the southern provinces, where the environment was more like their homeland. In the 1830s, due to the instability of the Regency, European immigration ground to a halt, only recovering after Pedro&nbsp;II took the reins of government and the country entered a period of peace and prosperity. Farmers in the southeast, enriched by lucrative coffee exports, created the so-called \"partnership system\" to attract immigrants. The scheme endured until the end of the 1850s, when the system collapsed. The failure was rooted in the large debts European settlers incurred in order to subsidize their travel and settlement expenses, leaving them virtually as indentured slaves to their employers. After several revolts, the system was almost completely abandoned. Immigration suffered another decline during the Paraguayan War, which lasted from 1864 to 1870.\\n\\nImmigrant numbers soared during the 1870s in what came to be called the \"great immigration\". Up to that point, around 10,000 Europeans arrived in Brazil annually, but after 1872, their numbers increased dramatically. From 1872 until 1879, the nationalities forming the bulk of the new settlers were composed of Portuguese (31.2%), Italians (25.8%), Germans (8.1%) and Spanish (1.9%). In the 1880s, Italians would surpass the Portuguese (61.8% to 23.3% respectively), and the Spanish would displace the Germans (6.7% to 4.2% respectively). Other, smaller groups also arrived, including Russians, Poles and Hungarians. Since nearly all European immigrants settled in the southeastern and southern areas of the Empire, ethnic distribution, already unequal before the mass immigration, became even more divergent between regions.\\n\\nIt is estimated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics that 500,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1883. The figure for European settlers arriving between 1884 and 1893 climbed to 883,668. The number of Europeans immigrating continued to rise in the following decades, with 862,100 between 1894 and 1903; and 1,006,617 between 1904 and 1913. For a nation that had a small, widely scattered population (4,000,000 in 1823 and 14,333,915 in 1890), the immigration of more than 1,380,000 Europeans had a tremendous effect upon the country's ethnic composition. In 1872, the year of the first reliable national census, white Europeans represented just over a third (38.1%) of the total population; in 1890, they had increased to a little under half (44.0%) of all Brazilians.\\n\\nthumbthumbIn 1823, a year after independence, slaves made up 29% of the population of Brazil, a figure which fell throughout the lifetime of the Empire: from 24% in 1854, to 15.2% in 1872, and finally to less than 5% in 1887—the year before slavery was completely abolished. Slaves were mostly adult males from southwestern Africa. Slaves brought to Brazil differed ethnically, religiously and linguistically, identifying with their own nations rather than as Africans. Some of the slaves brought to the Americas had been captured while fighting inter-tribal wars in Africa and had then been sold to slave dealers.While slaves were usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of white slaves—the product of generations of interbreeding between male slave owners and their female mulatto slaves (although this was very rare and was not approved of socially). Slaves and their descendants were usually found in regions devoted to producing exports for foreign markets. The eastern coast of the northwest region is representative where, during the 16th and 17th centuries, sugarcane was an important export crop. Northern Maranhão province is another instance where cotton and rice were produced in the 18th-century. In the 18th-century, slaves were also used in the Minas Gerais province where gold was extracted. Slavery was also common in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Espírito Santo and again in Minas Gerais during the 19th-century for the cultivation of coffee which became vital to the national economy.\\n\\nMost slaves worked as plantation laborers. Relatively few Brazilians owned slaves and most small and medium-sized farms employed free workers. Slaves could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire slaves and there were even cases of slaves who had their own slaves. Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long-established practice of selling slaves along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals.\\n\\nThe prevalence of slavery was not geographically uniform across Brazil. Around 1870 only five provinces (Rio de Janeiro with 30%, Bahia with 15%, Minas Gerais with 14%, São Paulo with 7% and Rio Grande do Sul also with 7%) held 73% of the nation's total slave population. These were followed by Pernambuco (with 6%) and Alagoas (with 4%). Among the remaining 13 provinces none individually had even 3%.\\n\\nSlaves who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed—the only exception being that, until 1881, freed slaves were barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.\\n\\nthumbThe nobility of Brazil differed markedly from its counterparts in Europe: noble titles were not hereditary, with the sole exception of members of the Imperial Family, and those who had received a noble title were not considered to belong to a separate social class, and received no appanage, stipend or emolument. However, many ranks, traditions, and regulations in Brazil's system of nobility were co-opted directly from the Portuguese aristocracy. During Pedro&nbsp;I's reign there were no clear requisites for someone to be ennobled. During Pedro&nbsp;II's reign (apart from the Regency period during which the regent could not grant titles or honors) the nobility evolved into a meritocracy with titles granted in recognition of an individual's outstanding service to the Empire or for the public good. Noble rank did not represent \"recognition of illustrious ancestry.\"\\n\\nIt was the Emperor's right as head of the Executive branch to grant titles and honors. The titles of nobility were, in ascending order, baron, viscount, count, marquis and duke. Apart from position in the hierarchy there were other distinctions between the ranks: counts, marquises and dukes were considered \"Grandees of the Empire\" while the titles of barons and viscounts could be bestowed \"with Greatness\" or \"without Greatness\". All ranks of the Brazilian nobility were to be addressed as \"Your Excellency\".\\n\\nBetween 1822 and 1889, 986 people were ennobled. Only three became Dukes: Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg (as Duke of Santa Cruz, brother-in-law to Pedro&nbsp;I), Dona Isabel Maria de Alcântara Brasileira (as Duchess of Goiás, illegitimate daughter of Pedro&nbsp;I) and lastly Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (as Duke of Caxias, hero of the Paraguayan War). The other titles granted were as follows: 47 marquises, 51 counts, 146 viscounts \"with Greatness\", 89 viscounts \"without Greatness\", 135 barons \"with Greatness\" and 740 barons \"without greatness\" resulting in a total of 1,211 noble titles. There were fewer nobles than noble titles because many were elevated more than once during their lifetime, e.g. the Duke of Caxias, who was a baron, then a count, a marquis and finally a duke. Grants of nobility were not limited to male Brazilians: Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald, a Scot, was made Marquis of Maranhão for his role in the Brazilian War of Independence, and 29 women received grants of nobility in their own right. As well as being unrestricted by gender, no racial distinctions were made in conferring noble status. Caboclos, mulattoes, blacks and even Indians were ennobled.\\n\\nThe lesser nobility, who were untitled, were made up of members of the Imperial Orders. There were six of these: the Order of Christ, the Order of Saint Benedict of Aviz, the Order of Saint James of the Sword, the Order of the Southern Cross, the Order of Pedro I and the Order of the Rose. The first three had grades of honor beyond the Grand Master (reserved for the Emperor only): knight, commander and grand cross. The latter three, however, had different ranks: the Order of the Southern Cross with four, the Order of the Rose with six, and the Order of Pedro I with three.\\n\\nthumbArticle five of the Constitution declared Catholicism to be the state religion. However, the clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, all of which led to a general loss of respect for the Catholic Church. During Pedro&nbsp;II's reign, the Imperial government embarked upon a program of reform designed to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the official religion, the Emperor exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs and paid clerical salaries, appointed parish priests, nominated bishops, ratified papal bulls and supervised seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops whose moral fitness, stance on education and support for reform met with their approval. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.\\n\\nCatholic clerics moved closer to the Pope and his doctrines, mainly Ultramontanism. This resulted in clashes during the 1870s between the clergy and the government, since the former wanted a more direct relationship with Rome and the latter sought to maintain its oversight of church affairs. Only after arduous negotiations was the government able to restore good relations with the clergy but this came at a high price. The main consequence of this conflict was that the clergy no longer saw any benefit in giving their support to Pedro&nbsp;II, although they were keen to see his eldest daughter and heir, Isabel, ascend to the throne, as she held ultramontane views. At the same time, the Catholic Church began to perceive Positivism (which embodied a clear anti-religious stance) as a serious threat—especially in Brazil where, by the end of the monarchy, it had taken root in the Military.\\n\\nThe Constitution did allow followers of other, non-Catholic, faiths to practice their religious beliefs, albeit only in private. The construction of non-Catholic religious buildings was forbidden. From the outset these restrictions were ignored and the authorities did not interfere. The main non-Catholic faiths in Brazil, although a very small minority, were Judaism and Protestantism.\\n\\nAll Jews residing in Portugal had been forcibly converted to Catholicism in 1496, years before Brazil was claimed by the Portuguese Crown. Those who resisted had been expelled and later settled in northern Africa (mainly in Morocco), becoming known as Sephardi Jews. Some of their descendants, who still spoke Portuguese centuries later, migrated to Brazil soon after its independence and settled mainly in the northeastern provinces of Bahia and Pernambuco and in the northern provinces of Amazonas and Pará. In Belém, Para's capital, the first synagogue was built in 1824—the same year in which Brazil's Constitution was promulgated. Other Jewish groups came from the Alsace-Lorraine region of Germany and Ashkenazi Jews immigrated from Russia to escape the anti-semitic pogroms following the assassination of Czar Alexander&nbsp;II in 1881. By the 1880s, there were several Jewish communities and synagogues scattered throughout Brazil.\\n\\nThe Protestants were another group that began settling in Brazil at the beginning of the 19th-century. The first Protestants were English, and an Anglican church was opened in Rio de Janeiro in 1820. Others were established afterwards in São Paulo, Pernambuco and Bahia provinces. They were followed by German and Swiss Lutherans who settled in the South and Southwest regions and built their own houses of worship. In the 1860s immigrants from the southern United States settled in São Paulo after fleeing the Reconstruction policy following the end of the U.S. Civil War. There followed various mission activities sponsored by several American churches including Baptists, Lutherans, Congregationalists and the Methodists, who were the most active of the Protestant sects. As well as preaching they built churches, started schools and published newspapers, all of which were welcomed by Brazilians.\\n\\nthumbthumbAccording to historian Ronald Raminelli, \"visual arts suffered huge innovations in the Empire in comparison to the colonial period.\" With independence in 1822, painting, sculpture and architecture were influenced by national symbols and the monarchy, as both surpassed religious themes in their importance. Also, the previously dominant old Baroque style was superseded by Neoclassicism. New developments appeared such as the use of iron in architecture, as well as the appearance of lithography and photography, which revitalized the visual arts.\\n\\nThe government's creation of the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts) in the 1820s played a pivotal role in influencing and expading the visual arts in Brazil, mainly by educating generations of artists but also by serving as a guide to style. Its origins laid in the foundation of the Escola Real das Ciências, Artes e Ofícios (Royal School of the Sciences, Arts and Crafts) in 1816 by the Portuguese King João&nbsp;VI. Its members-of whom the most famous was Jean-Baptiste Debret-were French emigrées who worked as painters, sculptors, musicians and engineers. The school's main goal was to teach the French art doctrine and the neoclassical style in place of Portuguese baroque. Plagued by a lack of funds since its inception, the school was later renamed as the Academy of Fine Arts in 1820 and in 1824 its definite name during the monarchy: Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts.\\n\\nIt was only following Pedro&nbsp;II's majority in 1840, however, that the Academy became a powerhouse, part of the Emperor's greater scheme of fomenting a national culture and consequently uniting all Brazilians in a common sense of nationhood. Pedro&nbsp;II would sponsor the Brazilian culture through several public institutions funded by the government (and not just the Academy of Fine Arts) such as Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute and Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera. That sponsorship would pave the way not only to the careers of artists, but also from historians such as Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen to opera composers as Antônio Carlos Gomes.\\n\\nBy the 1840s, Romanticism had largely supplanted neoclassicism, not only in painting, but also in sculpture and architecture. The Academy did not resume its role on simply giving education: prizes, medals, scholarships in foreign countries and funding were used as incentives. Among its staff and students were some of the most renowned Brazilians artists: Simplício Rodrigues de Sá, Félix Émile Taunay, Manuel de Araújo Porto-alegre, Pedro Américo, Victor Meirelles, Rodolfo Amoedo, Almeida Júnior, Rodolfo Bernardelli, João Zeferino da Costa and others.\\n\\nIn the 1880s, having been long regarded as the official style of the Academy, Romanticism declined, as other styles were explored by a new generation of artists, such as Landscape art, the most famous exponents of which were Georg Grimm, Giovanni Battista Castagneto, Joaquim José da França Júnior and Antônio Parreiras. Another style which gained popularity in the fields of painting and architecture was Eclecticism.\\n\\nthumbIn the first years after independence, Brazilian literature was still heavily influenced by Portuguese literature and its most important style, neoclassicism. In 1837, Gonçalves de Magalhães published the first work of Romanticism in Brazil, beginning a new era in the nation. The next year, 1838, the first play performed by Brazilians with a national theme (based on a romantic work by Gonçalves de Magalhães) marked the birth of Brazilian theater. Until then themes were often based on European works even if not performed by foreign actors. Romanticism, then, was regarded as the literary style that best fitted Brazilian literature, which could reveal its uniqueness when compared to foreign literature. In fact, it would be during the 1830s and 1840s that \"a network of newspapers, journals, book publishers, and printing houses emerged which together with the opening of theaters in the major towns brought into being what could be termed, but for the narrowness of its scope, a national culture.\"\\n\\nRomanticism reached its apogee between the late 1850s and the early 1870s as it divided into several branches, including Indianism and sentimentalism. The most influential literary style in 19th-century Brazil, many of the most renowned Brazilian writers were exponents of Romanticism: Manuel de Araújo Porto-alegre, Gonçalves Dias, Gonçalves de Magalhães, José de Alencar, Bernardo Guimarães, Álvares de Azevedo, Casimiro de Abreu, Castro Alves, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Manuel Antônio de Almeida and Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay.\\n\\nIn theater, the most famous Romanticist was the playwright Martins Pena, although others, such as Joaquim Manuel de Macedo also achieved fame. Although Brazilian Romanticism found its place in literature, it did not have the same success in theater, as most of the plays performed were either neoclassic tragedies or romantic works from Portugal or translations from the Italian, French or Spanish. As in other areas, the theater was also sponsored by the government (after the opening of the Brazilian Dramatic Conservatory, in 1845) which tried to help national theater companies with financial aid in exchange for staging plays in Portuguese.\\n\\nThe first reactions to Romanticism appeared in the 1870s but it would only be in the next decade that new literary styles would take its place. The first to appear was Realism, which had among its most notable writers Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis and Raul Pompeia. Newer styles that coexisted with Realism, Naturalism and Parnassianism were both connected to the former's evolution. Naturalism found acceptance in fiction, and Naturalist Brazilian writers were influenced by the French Émile Zola and by the Portuguese Eça de Queirós. Among its best-known names were Aluísio Azevedo and Adolfo Caminha. On the other hand, Parnassianism, \"a radical reaction to Romanticism\", found its place in poetry. Notable Brazilian Parnassian poets were: Gonçalves Crespo, Alberto de Oliveira, Raimundo Correia and Olavo Bilac.\\n\\nNational theater was also influenced by Realism but decades earlier than literature and poetry, in 1855. Among the most famous realist playwrights were José de Alencar, Quintino Bocaiuva, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Júlia Lopes de Almeida and Maria Angélica Ribeiro. Until the end of the Empire and beyond, national plays as well as national companies continued to compete for audiences with foreign plays and companies. Plays were not the only type of performing arts in Imperial Brazil: there were also duets, dancing, gymnastics, comedy and farces. Less prestigious, but more popular with the working classes were puppeteers and magicians, as well as the circus, with its travelling companies of performers, including acrobats, trained animals, illusionists and other stunt-oriented artists.\\n\\n<li>According to the Brazilian Constitution that lasted from 1824 until 1889 the country was officially called \"Império do Brasil\" (Empire of Brazil), not \"Império brasileiro\" (Brazilian Empire).\\n\\nmwl:Ampério de l Brasilpnb:سلطنت برازیل\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Employment Rights Act 1996", "body": "The Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA) was passed originally by the Conservative government in 1996. It consolidated a number of previous statutes dating from the Contracts of Employment Act 1963. It deals with rights that most employees can get when they work, including unfair dismissal, reasonable notice before dismissal, time off rights for parenting, redundancy and more.\\n\\nIt has also been amended substantially by the Labour government since 1997, for instance to include the right to request flexible working time.\\n\\nThe most important point about the Act is that there is some confusion about whom it covers. Most British people will be covered, but often vulnerable workers are not. Under s.230 of the Act the word \"employee\" is defined to mean somebody with a \"contract of employment\". This in turn means someone who has a \"contract of service\". In legal cases since the early 1980s, some judges have placed a restrictive interpretation on what that means. The opposite of a \"contract of service\" is a \"contract for services\", and it is meant to draw the line between someone who is working for another, on their account, under their control and someone who is working on their own account, controlling their own work. In other words, it is meant to be the difference between the truly \"employed\" and the \"self employed\".\\n\\nIn many cases, low paid, vulnerable workers, especially agency worker have been held to fall outside the scope of those rights in the Act which are only for \"employees\". This is because some judges have taken the view that there was not sufficient \"control\" or \"mutuality of obligation\" to establish a contract of employment. What those judges have meant by \"mutuality of obligation\" is that the terms of the contract, especially an obligation to work or not work at any given time and the promise of work in future, were not reciprocal enough. So in O'Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc [1983] ICR 728, Sir John Donaldson MR held that some waiters who were hired through an agency to do dinner functions were not \"employees\" (either of the function hall or the agency) because they did not, technically, have to turn up to work for a shift, and they could be sacked at any time. Sir John Donaldson MR said therefore, that the contract lacked \"mutuality\" and could not be described as one between an \"employee\" and \"employer\". The legal effect was to put them in the same boat as the \"self employed\" and that they were not covered by the Act. The practical effect was they had no right to fair dismissal and could be sacked for organising a trade union.\\n\\nBut other judges have said other things. In Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner [1984] ICR 612, part time workers were sewing pockets onto Nethermere company's trousers. The sewing machines were provided and they were paid by the piece. There was disagreement over holiday pay and they were removed. Stephenson LJ decided (at 623) \"There must, in my judgment, be an irreducible minimum of obligation on each side to create a contract of service.\" And what he meant by this was an exchange of wages for work and sufficient control to make establish the employee-employer relationship. He did not use the \"mutuality\" concept, or if he did, he used it to mean the exchange of wages for work, and no more.\\n\\nThere is considerable debate about where the scope of employment rights really lie. Most people will have a contract of employment, and fall squarely within the \"employee\" category. But it will not apply to professional self employed people at the top end of the labour market, and it is uncertain whether it always applies to those working through agencies and those whose jobs make them vulnerable.\\n\\nEmployees have a right under s94 of the Act not to be unfairly dismissed. This is probably the most important right, because it would usually be under an action after dismissal that a former employee would complain that his other rights were breached. Firstly, it is unusual to commence litigation against an employer while still working for them. Second some rights, such as the right to reasonable notice before dismissal (s.86) can logically only be breached when someone is dismissed.\\n\\nDismissal must be unfair, though this means it can also be harsh. The reasons laid out that an employer can dismiss are in s.98(2). Fair reasons to dismiss an employee are if it,\\n\\nSo there is no restriction on management's right to dismiss (for instance, giving reasonable notice) if the employee is (a) just bad at his job, (b) not a nice person to work with (ba) is retiring (c) is redundant (see below) or (d) the employer is forced to sack someone because of a law (this last one does not come up often). An important detail, however is that an employer may also dismiss, under s.98(1) for \"some other substantial reason\". For this, see the main page.\\n\\nMost dismissals take place for legitimate business reasons, because the employer will no longer require staff, or maybe because times are bad and the employer can no longer afford to pay. There may be the possibility of claiming redundancy (see below). But employers will usually be happy to write a reference. If they do there is an obligation to be accurate and fair, and that means not providing a so called \"kiss of death\" reference on to the next potential employer: if only bad things can be said, nothing should be said at all (see the case, Spring v. Guardian Assurance plc).\\n\\nThe way to enforce a claim for unfair dismissal is at an employment tribunal. An employee who is dismissed may also have breach of contract claim(s), based on common law. Common law claim(s) may be brought in a county court.\\n\\nEmployment tribunals are spread around the country, in most towns. The right to bring a case falls under Part X, Chapter 2, s.111. \\n\\nEmployees have a right to reasonable notice before having their contracts terminated under s.86. At present this means everyone should get a minimum of 1 week's notice before being dismissed if they have worked for the employer for more than a month. After 2 years, the minimum is 2 weeks' notice. After 3 years, 3 weeks' notice, and so on, up to a maximum of twelve weeks' notice. Naturally, many employees will have higher notice periods in their contracts, or under the protection of collective agreement established by the workplace union. It is important to note that these minimum periods are reciprocal - there is a \"mutuality of obligation\" - and so employees are also required to give such reasonable notice. However nothing prevents employers' giving pay in lieu of notice, or both sides agreeing within that period to waive their rights.\\n\\nBoth this right and the right to written particulars of one's contract of employment were introduced through the Contracts of Employment Act 1963.\\n\\nAn employee has an employment contract. Section 1(2) of the Employment Rights Act (1996) states, that the main terms of the contract must be in writing and provided to the employee within eight weeks of the start of their employment. This document is called a \"written statement of particulars\". It confirms the main express terms of the employment contract. Whilst not definitive of the entire contract, the written statement is intended to be a guide for employees' of their rights, so that they know what kind of terms and conditions of employment to expect (in reality people know anyway). But it is also meant to provide an evidential basis on which to bring a claim for the breach of some right in a court or employment tribunal.\\n\\nRights to time off for bringing up children are spread through Part VIII of the Act. This includes maternity leave and pay, paternity and parental leave.\\n\\nEmployees have the right to request flexible working under s.80F. It should be noted that this is not a right to flexible working time itself, but a right to request it. What an employer must do is (a) grant more flexible hours, or (b) give written reasons for declining to do so. In practice this has been a success, because once employers start thinking about whether they can accommodate their employees' needs, they have realised it is not that difficult.\\n\\nSection 135 of the Act gives employees a right to redundancy payments. This means when their jobs have become obsolete and employer should compensate them, provided they have become an established employee. The qualifying period for redundancy is having worked for two years with the same employer (s.155). You are not entitled to redundancy if you have simply reached retiring age (s.156). And nothing prevents the employer from making a dismissal for misconduct or capability, as outlined under the fairness provisions for dismissal (s.98).\\n\\nThe amount of redundancy is based on a length of service calculation and age. For each year you have worked while you were under 21 years old, you get half a week's pay. For each year between ages 21 and 40, one week's pay. For each year over 40, one and a half week's pay (s.162). However, there is an upper limit set on what can be considered a week's pay, which is approximately the same as a week on the minimum wage (if you were made redundant on or before 30 September 2009, it was £350 per week - currently it is £380, before tax).\\n\\nThis right, under s.182, to compensation for lost earnings is for when the employer goes broke. It applies in the unlucky cases where an employer has gone bankrupt or insolvent and there is no money left to pay the staff, who have outstanding pay cheques. The Secretary of State, on behalf of the government, guarantees pay up to a certain maximum, to replace what was lost.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Empress Shen Wuhua", "body": "Empress Shen Wuhua (沈婺華), later Buddhist nun name Guanyin (觀音), was an empress of the Chinese dynasty Chen Dynasty. Her husband was Chen Shubao, the last emperor of the dynasty.\\n\\nShen Wuhua's father Shen Junli (沈君理) was a junior official during the reign of Chen's founder Emperor Wu, and Emperor Wu, impressed by his abilities, gave Shen Junli his daughter the Princess Kuaiji as his wife, and Shen Wuhua was born of the Princess Kuaiji, but her birth year is lost to history. He subsequently served under Emperor Wu's nephews Emperor Wen and Emperor Xuan. When the Princess died, Shen Wuhua mourned her greatly, and was praised for her filial piety. In 569, she married Chen Shubao, who was then his father Emperor Xuan's crown prince, as his wife and crown princess. (Her age at the time, as noted above, is not known; he was 16.) They did not have any sons together, and when his concubine Consort Sun died in childbirth in 573 while giving birth to his first son Chen Yin, she took Chen Yin and raised him as her own son. Her father Shen Junli died later that year, and she again mourned greatly.\\n\\nIn 582, Emperor Xuan died, and Chen Shubao, after surviving a failed coup attempt by his brother Chen Shuling (陳叔陵) the Prince of Shixing and cousin Chen Bogu (陳伯固) the Prince of Xin'an, albeit with substantial injuries, took the throne. He created her empress and Chen Yin crown prince. However, as he did not favor her, she was not allowed to attend to him during his injuries—only Consort Zhang Lihua, his favorite concubine, was allowed to.\\n\\nEmpress Shen was said to be solemn and had few desires, spending much of her time studying Confucian classics, history, and Buddhist sutra, as well as practicing calligraphy. She did not participate much in Chen Shubao's feasting, and he did not favor her, instead greatly favoring his Consort Zhang, who effectively took over the governance of the palace. Empress Shen had few complaints about that, however, and she lived a frugal life, limiting her staff to about 100 people and not using elaborate decorations, often submitting suggestions to Chen Shubao. In 588, believing in accusations that Chen Yin despised him for not favoring Empress Shen, Chen Shubao deposed him and replaced him with Consort Zhang's son Chen Shen. He also considered deposing Empress Shen and replacing her with Consort Chang, but had not had chance to carry this out when Sui Dynasty forces captured the capital Jiankang in 589, seizing him and ending Chen, unifying China.\\n\\nConsort Zhang was executed by the Sui general Gao Jiong, but Chen Shubao was spared and taken to the Sui capital Chang'an to be treated as an honored guest of Emperor Wen of Sui. Empress Shen followed Chen Shubao to Chang'an. She wrote deeply mournful texts to commemorate him when he died in 604. Earlier that year, Emperor Wen had died as well and was succeeded by his son Emperor Yang of Sui, who, during his reign, undertook 11 journeys through various parts of the empire and often had Empress Shen accompany his train. She was with his train in Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in 618, when he was killed in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. After Emperor Yang's death, Empress Shen crossed the Yangtze river south to the city Piling (毗陵, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), where she became a Buddhist nun with the name Guanyin—same as the Chinese name for the Buddhist deity Avalokiteśvara. She died early in the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang (626-649), but the exact year is not known.\\n\\n|-\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Endoscopic foreign body retrieval", "body": "rightEndoscopic foreign body retrieval refers to the removal of ingested objects from the esophagus, stomach and duodenum by endoscopic techniques. It does not involve surgery, but rather encompasses a variety of techniques employed through the gastroscope for grasping foreign bodies, manipulating them, and removing them while protecting the esophagus and trachea. It is of particular importance with children, people with mental illness, and prison inmates as these groups have a high rate of foreign body ingestion.\\n\\nCommonly swallowed objects include coin, button, batteries, and small bones (such as fish bones), but can include more complex objects, such as eyeglasses, spoons, and toothbrush (see image).\\n\\nSome patients at risk for foreign body ingestion may not be able to give an accurate medical history of ingestion, either due to age or mental illness. It is important that physicians treating these patients recognize the symptom of esophageal foreign body impaction requiring urgent intervention. Most frequently, these include drooling and the inability to swallow saliva, neck tenderness, regurgitation of food, stridor and shortness of breath if there is compression of the trachea.\\n\\nThere are several situations in which endoscopic techniques are not indicated, such as for small blunt objects less than 2.5 cm which have already passed into the stomach (as these usually do not obstruct anywhere else), when there is perforation of the esophagus or mediastinitis (inflammation of structures around the esophagus), and for narcotic-containing bags or condom that have been ingested, because of the risk of overdose if they are ruptured.\\n\\nForeign bodies should be removed from the esophagus within 24 hours of ingestion because of a high risk of complication.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nPrior to undertaking endoscopy, attempts should be made to locate the foreign body with x-ray or other non-invasive techniques. For radio-opaque objects, x-rays of the neck, chest and abdomen can be used to locate the foreign body and assist endoscopy. Alternative approaches, including the use of metal detector, have also been described.\\n\\nX-rays are also useful for identifying the type of foreign body ingested and complications of foreign body ingestion, including mediastinitis and perforation of the esophagus.\\n\\nEndoscopic retrieval involves the use of a gastroscope or an optic fiber charge-coupled device camera. This instrument is shaped as a long tube, which is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach to identify the foreign body or bodies. This procedure is typically performed under conscious sedation. Many techniques have been described to remove foreign bodies from the stomach and esophagus. Usually the esophagus is protected with an overtube (a plastic tube of varying length), through which the gastroscope and retrieved objects are passed.\\n\\nOnce the foreign body has been identified with the gastroscope, various devices can be passed through the gastroscope to grasp or manipulate the foreign body. Devices used include forceps, which come in varying shapes, sizes and grips, snare, and oval loops that can be retracted from outside the gastroscope to lasso objects, as well as Roth basket (mesh nets that can be closed to trap small objects), and magnet placed at the end of the scope or at the end of orogastric tubes. Some techniques have been described that use foley catheter to trap objects, or use two snares to orient foreign bodies.\\n\\n"}

Johannes Kleven was a music teacher in Skudeneshavn, one of the main towns of the Skudenes parish of the island of Karmøy, Rogaland. Cleven studied music under his father during his childhood, but was not able to pursue a musical education when his father's death, when Cleven was nine, left the family in poverty. Cleven attended public school and, at the age of fourteen, began working as a ship hand, where he cooked food for sailors and was frequently beaten for minor misdemeanors. To escape the hardships of the fishing life he moved to the United States at the age of seventeen and settled in Inwood, Iowa, where he lived for several years before moving to New York City in 1893 to pursue further opportunities. \\n\\nCleven worked at the Columbia hospital in New York City between 1893 and 1899, during this time, he studied music with Professor Brunker, who was also a personal friend of Cleven and also noted within the Norwegian community. Cleven became a maestro at violin and was active at boxing and wrestling and also became a personal acquaintance of the boxer Bob Fitzsimmons. In 1899, Cleven enlisted in the US Army during the Spanish-American War and was stationed in the Philippines as part of the 203rd New York Volunteer Infantry, eventually being promoted to Sergeant in the US Army Musical Corps. After the war had ended, Cleven returned to Norway to visit his family, travelling via Japan, India, China, the Suez Canal and other countries along the way.\\n\\nCleven returned to Canada and re-settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba in April 1903 and began work as a photographer and musician. He married Margit Hoines, daughter of Lars Aadnesen Hoines and Maria Vaula of Skudenes, in a Lutheran ceremony on September 7, 1904. The couple had met during Cleven's return to Norway. Together they had six children: daughters Camilla (who died in infancy) and Lillian and sons Endre, Harald, Alf and Odvar.\\n\\nCleven began working with the Norwegian-Canadian community shortly after his return to Canada, participating in inviting Norwegians to immigrate and helping to start the \"Nord Mannslaget\" (Normannalaget) in modern Norwegian, a Norwegian-Canadian society. He started a mixed choir and was its conductor. For many years he was the president of the Musicians Union, and one of the organizers of the city Musicians' Club. He played the violin and bass violin at the Walker Theatre Orchestra and later at the Orpheum Theatre in Winnipeg. \\n\\nIn January 1912, the Canadian government commissioned Cleven to be in charge of Canada's Scandinavian settlement program. During this time, he had an office in Winnipeg and travelled throughout the United States and Canada to further the settlement of Manitoba by Norwegians. \\n\\nAfter the outbreak of the First World War, Cleven, ranked Captain, was appointed as the leader of three Norwegian-Canadians who were intent on organizing the 197th Battalion (\"The Vikings of Canada\") of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Endre's motive and the impetus for the battalion's formation was that he was concerned about the possibility of Norwegians not being seen as loyal Canadians in wartime.\\n\\nWhile travelling to Camp Hughes (a temporary camp in Manitoba) in order to arrange for a summer camp that was to be the battalion's first muster, Cleven died after the car he was travelling in ran into a ditch near Portage La Prairie, Manitoba. He was the only one of the three onboard to die, and ironically the most important to the future of the battalion. Cleven was buried with full military honours. His funeral was the first military funeral held in Winnipeg after the outbreak of the First World War. His death was described as a \"hard blow\" to the Norwegian-Canadian community.\\n\\n \\n\\n"}

Together with the priest Virgil Šček, Besednjak became one of the leaders of the Slovene Christian Socialist youth in the Austrian Littoral. Between 1913 and 1914, he was the president of the Christian Social Association (Krščansko-socialna zveza) in Gorizia and Gradisca, and between 1917 and 1919, he was a personal secretary of the chairman of the Slovene People's Party Anton Korošec.\\n\\nAfter World War One, he returned to Gorizia, and soon became one of the main figures of Slovene and Croat political Catholicism in the so-called Julian March, an administrative region formed out of the former Austro-Hungarian Adriatic provinces annexed to Italy. In 1919, he became chief editor of the Slovene daily newspaper Edinost ('Unity') of Trieste, and in 1921 he was elected to the Provincial Assembly of the Province of Gorizia. From 1922 to 1924, he was director of the newspaper Goriška straža ('The Guard of Gorizia'). In the mid 1920s, he was member of the executive board of the League of the Slovene Agrarian Workers in Italy, and of the National Council of Croats and Slovenes in the Julian March. He also served as editor of the journal Socialna misel ('Social Thought').\\n\\nIn 1924, he was elected to the Italian Parliament on the unified list of Slovene, Croat and South Tyrol parties. Besednjak thus became, together with the national liberal politician Josip Wilfan who was also elected on the same list, the highest representative of the around half a million South Slavs living in Italy. He quickly rose to prominence for his eloquent defence of minority rights against Fascist Italianization. Despite his consistent criticism of the regime, he insisted on the political loyalty to the Italian state. He did not join the Aventine Secession, but continued with regular parliamentary work until mid 1926. \\n\\nHis parliamentary speeches, in which he defended minority rights, and human rights in general, from the early abuses of the Fascist regime, became famous among the Slovenes and Croats. Besednjak's speeches also attracted the attention of the Italian political scene and included parliamentary debates with the highest officials of the regime, including the Minister of Education Giovanni Gentile and Benito Mussolini himself. These speeches were printed in an integral version by Besednjak's journal Goriška straža, thus becoming widely known in the Slovene public. Several of his statements and punchlines entered the daily speech or acquired legendary status. His most famous speeches were directed against the school reform which sanctioned Italian as the sole language of education in Italy. In his last speech, delivered in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, he stated that, after the abolition of Slovene and Croatian language schools, every South Slavic family in Italy would transform itself into a school. In his concluding remark, he stated that \"the laws of States are mutable, but Nations live forever\", thus famously asserting the natural right of peoples before the established legal conventions.\\n\\nIn 1929, Besednjak emigrated to Argentina, but already the following year he returned to Europe in order to work at the Congress of European National Minorities in Vienna, serving as its vice-president. Afterwards, he moved to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, settling in Belgrade. Throughout the interwar period, he remained a member of the Slovene People’s Party, supporting its centrist faction led by the Christian Democratic politician Andrej Gosar. After 1935, when the party leadership decided to support with the conservative Yugoslav government of Milan Stojadinović, Besednjak became increasingly critical of its policies. Although he remained a member of the Slovene People's Party, he became disenchanted with its authoritarian and corporatist shift. \\n\\nHe spent the World War II years in Belgrade. Although he did not join any of the political factions fighting against the German occupation of Yugoslavia. Initially, he rejecting the both the partisan movement and Draža Mihajlović's Chetniks, as well as the various collaborationist militias (such as the Slovene Home Guard). After 1943, he collaborated with of the so-called \"Catholic Centre\", led by Jakob Šolar and Andrej Gosar in the Province of Ljubljana, and Virgil Šček in the Julian March, trying to keep a balance between the pro-Communist Liberation Front of the Slovenian People and various anti-Communist forces. After 1944, however, he became increasingly supportive of Josip Broz Tito’s partisan movement, believing that the Communists would be the only force able to achieve the annexation of the Slovenian Littoral and Istria to Yugoslavia, as well as the only ones capable to keep the country together.\\n\\nWith the Paris Treaty of 1947, the Istria peninsula and most of the Slovenian Littoral were annexed to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Gorizia and the Slovene-inhabited Venetian Slovenia remained part of Italy, while Trieste and the neighbouring villages were included in the Allied-administered Free Territory of Trieste. In 1950, Besednjak settled in Trieste. There, he was among the co-founders of the Slovene Christian Social Union, which later merged with other Slovene democratic and anti-Communist parties in Italy into the Slovene Union. After the annexation of the Province of Trieste to Italy in 1954, he retired from public life. In the late 1950s, he published a memoir dedicated to his friend and collaborator Virgil Šček. The text remains, to this days, one of the most comprehensive sources on the Slovene and Croat political movement in the Julian March under the Kingdom of Italy.\\n\\nHe died in Trieste in 1968.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Engine-generator", "body": "thumbAn engine-generator is the combination of an electrical generator and an engine (prime mover) mounted together to form a single piece of equipment. This combination is also called an engine-generator set or a gen-set. In many contexts, the engine is taken for granted and the combined unit is simply called a generator.\\n\\nIn addition to the engine and generator, engine-generators generally include a fuel supply, a constant engine speed regulator (governor) and a generator voltage regulator, cooling and exhaust systems, and lubrication system. Units larger than about 1 kW rating often have a battery and electric starter motor; very large units may start with compressed air either to an air driven starter motor or introduced directly to the engine cylinders to initiate engine rotation. Standby power generating units often include an automatic starting system and a transfer switch to disconnect the load from the utility power source when there is a power failure and connect it to the generator.\\n\\nEngine-generators are available in a wide range of power ratings. These include small, hand-portable units that can supply several hundred watts of power, hand-cart mounted units, as pictured below, that can supply several thousand watts and stationary or trailer-mounted units that can supply over a million watts. Regardless of the size, generators may run on gasoline, diesel, natural gas, propane, bio-diesel, sewage gas or hydrogen. Most of the smaller units are usually built to use gasoline (petrol) as a fuel, and the larger ones have various fuel types, including diesel, natural gas and propane (liquid or gas). Some engines may also operate on diesel and gas simultaneously (bi-fuel operation).\\n\\nSome engine-generators use a turbine as the engine, such as the industrial gas turbines used in peaking power plant and the microturbines used in some hybrid electric bus.\\n\\nOther engine-generators use a steam engine, such as most coal-powered fossil-fuel power plant.\\n\\nOther engine-generators use a reciprocating engine.\\n\\nThe generator voltage (volts), frequency (Hz) and power (watts) ratings are selected to suit the load that will be connected.\\n\\nEngine driven generators fueled on natural gas fuel often form the heart of small scale less than 1,000 kW combined heat and power installations.\\n\\nThere are only a few portable three-phase generator models available in the US. Most of the portable units available are single phase power only and most of the three-phase generators manufactured are large industrial type generators. In other countries where three-phase power is more common in households, portable generators are available from a few kW and upwards. \\n\\nPortable engine-generators may require an external power conditioner to safely operate some types of electronic equipment. Small portable generators may use an inverter. Inverter models can run at slower RPMs to generate the power that is necessary, thus reducing the noise of the engine and making it more fuel-efficient. Inverter generators are best to power sensitive electronic devices such as computers and lights that use a ballast.\\n\\nThe mid-size stationary engine-generator pictured here is a 100 kVA set which produces 415 V at around 110 A. It is powered by a 6.7 liter turbocharged Perkins Phaser 1000 Series engine, and consumes approximately 27 liters of fuel an hour, on a 400 liter tank. Diesel engines in the UK can run on red diesel and rotate at 1,500 or 3,000 rpm. This produces power at a frequency of 50 Hz, which is the frequency used in the UK. In areas where the power frequency is 60 Hz (United States), generators rotate at 1,800 rpm or another divisor of 3600. Diesel engine-generator sets operated at their peak efficiency point can produce between 3 and 4 kilowatthours of electrical energy for each liter of diesel fuel consumed, with lower efficiency at part load.\\n\\nEngine-generators are used to supply electrical power in places where utility (central station) power is not available, or where power is needed only temporarily. Small generators are sometimes used to supply power tools at construction sites. Trailer-mounted generators supply power for temporary installations of lighting, sound amplification systems, amusement rides etc.\\n\\nTrailer mounted generators or mobile generators, diesel generators are also used for emergencies or backup where either a redundant system is required or no generator is on site. To make the hookup faster and safer, a  is frequently installed near the building switchgear that contains connectors such as camlocks. The tie in panel may also contain a phase rotation indicator (for 3 phase systems) and a circuit breaker. Camlock connectors are rated for 400 amps upto 480 volt systems and used with 4/0 type W cable connecting to the generator. Tie in panel designs are common between 200 to 3000 amp applications. \\n\\nStandby power generators are permanently installed and kept ready to supply power to critical loads during temporary interruptions of the utility power supply. Hospitals, communications service installations, data processing centers, sewage pumping stations and many other important facilities are equipped with standby power generators.Some standby power generators can automatically detect the loss of grid power, start the motor, run using fuel from a natural gas line, detect when grid power is restored, and then turn itself off -- with no human interaction.\\n\\nPrivately-owned generators are especially popular in areas where grid power is undependable or unavailable. Trailer-mounted generators can be towed to disaster areas where grid power has been temporarily disrupted.\\n\\nOperation of portable electric generators must occur in well ventilated spaces to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "English art song", "body": "The composition of art song in England and English-speaking countries has a long history, beginning with lute song in the late 16th century and continuing today.\\n\\nthumbThe composition of polyphonic music was at its peak in the late 16th century. By that time, however, the lute started to gain popularity, and was very common among educated people by 1600. The Italians were trying to recapture a simpler vocal style, to mimic Greek models. Giulio Caccini and the Florentine Camerata developed the monody, for solo voice with lute accompaniment, around 1600. Caccini traveled around Europe, other countries begin developing their own solo songs with lute, especially the English composers. John Dowland (1563–1626) and Thomas Campion (1567–1620) emerged as the best-known and most respected of the composers of lute song. Later in the 17th century, Henry Purcell (1659–95) composed many solo songs for his semi-operas, and his songs are also generally considered among the best early English Art songs.\\n\\nOther English Art song composers in the 17th century\\n\\nAs Italian opera composition developed in the later 17th century, recitative and aria began to split apart as separate parts of solo vocal music. Four types of vocal music began to blossom in the 18th century: Church music, early oratorio (esp. with Carissimi in Italy), opera, and the secular (or \"chamber\") cantata. In the early 18th century, George Frideric Handel (1685–1759) made Italian opera very popular in London, but The Beggar's Opera in 1729, a parody of Handel's Italian operas, created a new fad for English popular opera, and Italian opera in London faded by 1740. Thus, the two important types of English solo vocal music in the mid 18th century are oratorios by Handel, and \"pastiche operas\" or \"ballad operas\" from Arne, Boyce and other English composers. The publication of solo vocal music (songs often called \"canzonets\" or canzonettas\") with English texts at the end of the 18th century helped to establish the art song genre in subsequent years.thumbEnglish Art song composers in the 18th century\\n\\nLondon was the largest city in Europe by 1800; many non-English composers traveled there, especially from Germany and Italy. English theater works (\"ballad operas\") continued to be popular into the 19th century. The harpsichord, fortepiano, harp, and guitar were all popular instruments at the time; all were used to accompany voices and as solo instruments; song composition began to flourish as home music making with these instrument increased. In the 19th century almost everyone sang, in choral societies, at church services, and at home (in the 'drawing room'). Popular songs, called ballads, became the standard for vocal music publishing later in the 19th century, creating a \"low point\" in British music composition. Famous singers performed these ballads in concerts, paid for by music publishers, so that the songs would gain popularity and sell copies. In contrast, serious British composers late in the 19th century look towards Germany for inspiration and support.thumbPrimary English Art song composers in the early 19th century\\n\\nPrimary English Art song composers in the mid- to late 19th century\\n\\nthumbOther English Art song composers in the mid- to late 19th century\\n\\nThe great success of European Romantic composers encouraged a \"Renaissance\" of English music, especially vocal music. Interest in British folk music was expanded through the work of Cecil Sharp, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others; it gradually becomes incorporated into British \"classical\" music. The highest point of the English musical \"Renaissance\" began around 1900, and many great art songs were composed in England before the First World War.

{"title": "English compound", "body": "A compound is a word composed of more than one free morpheme.\\n\\nEnglish compounds may be classified in several ways, such as the word class or the semantic relationship of their components.\\n\\nMost English compound noun are noun phrase (= nominal phrases) that include a noun modified by adjective or attributive noun. Due to the English tendency towards conversion, the two classes are not always easily distinguished. Most English compound nouns that consist of more than two words can be constructed recursively by combining two words at a time. Combining \"science\" and \"fiction\", and then combining the resulting compound with \"writer\", for example, can construct the compound \"science fiction writer\". Some compounds, such as salt and pepper or mother-of-pearl, cannot be constructed in this way, however.\\n\\nSince English is a mostly analytic language, unlike most other Germanic language, it creates compounds by concatenating words without case marker. As in other Germanic languages, the compounds may be arbitrarily long. However, this is obscured by the fact that the written representation of long compounds always contains blanks. Short compounds may be written in three different ways, which do not correspond to different pronunciations, however: \\n\\nUsage in the US and in the UK differs and often depends on the individual choice of the writer rather than on a hard-and-fast rule; therefore, open, hyphenated, and closed forms may be encountered for the same compound noun, such as the triplets container ship/container-ship/containership and particle board/particle-board/particleboard.\\n\\nIn addition to this native English compounding, there is the classical type, which consists of words derived from Latin, as horticulture, and those of Greek origin, such as photography, the components of which are in bound form (connected by connecting vowels, which are most often -i- and -o- in Latin and Greek respectively) and cannot stand alone.\\n\\nIn general, the meaning of a compound noun is a specialization of the meaning of its head. The modifier limits the meaning of the head. This is most obvious in descriptive compound (known as karmadharaya compounds in the Sanskrit tradition), in which the modifier is used in an attributive or appositional manner. A blackboard is a particular kind of board, which is (generally) black, for instance.\\n\\nIn determinative compound, however, the relationship is not attributive. For example, a footstool is not a particular type of stool that is like a foot. Rather, it is a stool for one's foot or feet. (It can be used for sitting on, but that is not its primary purpose.) In a similar manner, an office manager is the manager of an office, an armchair is a chair with arms, and a raincoat is a coat against the rain. These relationships, which are expressed by preposition in English, would be expressed by grammatical case in other languages. (Compounds of this type are known as tatpurusha in the Sanskrit tradition.)\\n\\nBoth of the above types of compounds are called endocentric compounds because the semantic head is contained within the compound itself—a blackboard is a type of board, for example, and a footstool is a type of stool.\\n\\nHowever, in another common type of compound, the exocentric or (known as a bahuvrihi compound in the Sanskrit tradition), the semantic head is not explicitly expressed. A redhead, for example, is not a kind of head, but is a person with red hair. Similarly, a blockhead is also not a head, but a person with a head that is as hard and unreceptive as a block (i.e. stupid). And, outside of veterinary surgery, a lionheart is not a type of heart, but a person with a heart like a lion (in its bravery, courage, fearlessness, etc.).\\n\\nNote in general the way to tell the two apart:\\n\\nExocentric compounds occur more often in adjectives than nouns. A V-8 car is a car with a V-8 engine rather than a car that is a V-8, and a twenty-five-dollar car is a car with a worth of $25, not a car that is $25. The compounds shown here are bare, but more commonly, a suffix morpheme is added, esp. -ed. Hence, a two-legged person is a person with two legs, and this is exocentric.\\n\\nOn the other hand, endocentric adjectives are also frequently formed, using the suffixal morphemes -ing or -er/or. A people-carrier is a clear endocentric determinative compound: it is a thing that is a carrier of people. The related adjective, car-carrying, is also endocentric: it refers to an object, which is a carrying-thing (or equivalent, which does carry).\\n\\nThese types account for most compound nouns, but there are other, rarer types as well. Coordinative, copulative or dvandva compounds combine elements with a similar meaning, and the compound meaning may be a generalization instead of a specialization. Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, is the combined area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but a fighter-bomber is an aircraft that is both a fighter and a bomber. Iterative or amredita compounds repeat a single element, to express repetition or as an emphasis. Day by day and go-go are examples of this type of compound, which has more than one head.\\n\\nAnalyzability may be further limited by cranberry morpheme and semantic changes. For instance, the word butterfly, commonly thought to be a metathesis for flutter by, which the bugs do, is actually based on an old bubbe-maise that butterflies are petite witch that steal butter from window sill. Cranberry is a part translation from Low German, which is why we cannot recognize the element cran (from the Low German kraan or kroon, \"crane\"). The ladybird or ladybug was named after the Christian expression \"our Lady, the Virgin Mary\".\\n\\nIn the case of verb+noun compounds, the noun may be either the subject or the object of the verb. In playboy, for example, the noun is the subject of the verb (the boy plays), whereas it is the object in callgirl (someone calls the girl).\\n\\nStress patterns may distinguish a compound word from a noun phrase consisting of the same component words. For example, a black board, adjective plus noun, is any board that is black, and has equal stress on both elements. The compound blackboard, on the other hand, though it may have started out historically as black board, now is stressed on only the first element, black. Thus a compound such as the White House normally has a falling intonation which a phrase such as a white house does not.\\n\\nEnglish compound adjectives are constructed in a very similar way to the compound noun. Blackboard Jungle, leftover ingredients, gunmetal sheen, and green monkey disease are only a few examples.\\n\\nA compound adjective is a modifier of a noun. It consists of two or more morphemes of which the left-hand component limits or changes the modification of the right-hand one, as in \"the dark-green dress\": dark limits the green that modifies dress.\\n\\nThere are some well-established permanent compound adjectives that have become solid over a longer period, especially in American usage: earsplitting, eyecatching, and downtown.\\n\\nHowever, in British usage, these, apart from downtown, are more likely written with a hyphen: ear-splitting, eye-catching.\\n\\nOther solid compound adjectives are for example:\\n\\nA compound adjective is hyphenated if the hyphen helps the reader differentiate a compound adjective from two adjacent adjectives that each independently modifies the noun. Compare the following examples:\\n\\nThe hyphen is unneeded when capitalization or italicization makes grouping clear:\\n\\nIf, however, there is no risk of ambiguities, it may be written without a hyphen: Sunday morning walk.\\n\\nHyphenated compound adjectives may have been formed originally by an adjective preceding a noun:\\n\\nOthers may have originated with a verb preceding an adjective or adverb:\\n\\nYet others are created with an original verb preceding a preposition.\\n\\nThe following compound adjectives are always hyphenated when they are not written as one word:\\n\\nThe following compound adjectives are not normally hyphenated:\\n\\nA compound verb is usually composed of a preposition and a verb, although other combinations also exist. The term compound verb was first used in publication in Grattan and Gurrey's Our Living Language (1925).\\n\\nFrom a morphological point of view, some compound verbs are difficult to analyze because several derivations are plausible. Blacklist, for instance, might be analyzed as an adjective+verb compound, or as an adjective+noun compound that becomes a verb through zero derivation. Most compound verbs originally have the collective meaning of both components, but some of them later gain additional meanings that may predominate the original, accurate sense. Therefore, sometimes the resultant meanings are seemingly barely related to the original contributors.\\n\\nCompound verbs composed of a noun and verb are comparatively rare, and the noun is generally not the direct object of the verb. In English, compounds such as *bread-bake or *car-drive do not exist. Yet, we find literal action words, such as breastfeed, and washing instructions on clothing as for example hand wash.\\n\\nCompound verbs with single-syllable modifiers are solid, or unhyphen. Those with longer modifiers may originally be hyphenated, but as they became established, they became solid, e.g.,\\n\\nThere was a tendency in the 18th century to use hyphens excessively, that is, to hyphenate all previously established solid compound verbs. American English, however, has diminished the use of hyphens, while British English is more conservative.\\n\\nEnglish syntax distinguishes between phrasal verb and preposition verbs. Consider the following:\\n\\nThe first three sentences are possible in English; the last one is unlikely. When to hold up means to raise, it is a prepositional verb; the preposition up can be detached from the verb and has its own individual meaning \"from lower to a higher position\". As a prepositional verb, it has a literal meaning. However, when to hold up means to rob, it is a phrasal verb. A phrasal verb is used in an idiomatic, figurative or even metaphorical context. The preposition is inextricably linked to the verb; the meaning of each word cannot be determined independently but is in fact part of the idiom.\\n\\nThe Oxford English Grammar (ISBN 0-19-861250-8) distinguishes seven types of prepositional or phrasal verbs in English:\\n\\nEnglish has a number of other kinds of compound verb idioms. There are compound verbs with two verbs (e.g. make do). These too can take idiomatic prepositions (e.g. get rid of). There are also idiomatic combinations of verb and adjective (e.g. come true, run amok) and verb and adverb (make sure), verb and fixed noun (e.g. go ape); and these, too, may have fixed idiomatic prepositions (e.g. take place on).\\n\\n\"Compound verb\" is often used in place of:\\n\\nCompounds\\n\\n"}

When John Rylands died in 1888, Enriqueta as the inheritor of the major part of his estate became a major shareholder of his family firm and in the Manchester Ship Canal.\\n\\nIn memory of her husband, Enriqueta founded the John Rylands Library. She admired the design of Basil Champneys's library for Mansfield College, Oxford, and contracted him to develop something similar, on a more lavish scale. The library was inaugurated on 6 October 1899, the anniversary of her marriage. On the same day, she was admitted to the Freedom of the City of Manchester, the first woman to be so honoured. She was committed to many philanthropic and missionary causes and bequeathed much of her wealth to educational and medical institutions (including the Victoria University of Manchester).\\n\\nIn later life she was affected by rheumatic symptoms and spent frequent periods convalescing overseas. In 1894, she purchased a villa in Torquay where she died 14 years later.

{"title": "Enterocytozoon bieneusi", "body": "Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a species of the order microsporida which infects the intestinal epithelial cell. It is an obligate intracellular parasite.\\n\\nEnterocytozoon bieneusi, commonly known as microsporidia, is a unicellular, obligate intracellular eukaryote. Their life cycle includes a proliferative merogonic stage, followed by a sporogonic stage resulting in small, environmentally resistant, infective spores, which is their transmission mode. The spores contain a long, coiled polar tube, which distinguishes them from all other organisms and has a crucial role in host cell invasion. E. bieneusi was first found in an AIDS patient in France in 1985 and was later found in swine in 1996 in fecal samples. It causes diarrhea thus the pigs excrete more spores spreading the disease. As this pathogen is very prevalent throughout the world, E. bieneusi is found in a wide variety of hosts including pigs, humans, and other mammals. E. bieneusi can be studied using TEM, light microscopy, PCR and immunofluorescence and can be cultured for short-term. It has not been known yet whether the pathogen gets any diseases and there seem to be widespread economic implications of this pathogen in the swine industry. Furthermore, several treatment medications such as Fumagilin and albendazole seem promising (Mathis et al. 2005).\\n\\nTaxonomy:\\n\\nEnterocytozoon bieneusi\\n\\nKingdom: Fungi\\n\\nDivision/Phylum: Microspora\\n\\nClass: Microsporea\\n\\nOrder: Microsporida\\n\\nFamily: Enterocytozoonidae\\n\\nGenus: Enterocytozooan\\n\\nSpecies: Bieneusi\\n\\nCommon Name: Microsporidia\\n\\nThe earliest reference to the order microsporida was in the mid-20th century. E. bieneusi was first found in an AIDS patient in France in 1985. The electron microscope studies revealed presence of developmental stages of parasite resembling microsporidia. The investigators then named it as E. bieneusi (Desportes et. al. 1985). The presence of E. bieneusi in swine was first detected in fecal samples of pigs in Zurich, Switzerland in 1996 (Deplazes et. al. 1996)\\n\\nShort-term culturing of E. bieneusi was achieved by inoculating duodenal aspirate and biopsy specimens into E6 and HLF monolayers. The short-term cultures lasted up to 6 months. After several weeks of culture, gram-positive spore-like structures measuring 1 to 1.2 um long were observed. Mature spores and sporoblasts with double rows of polar tubule coils were seen (Visvesvara 2002). Long term culturing seems to be unsuccessful.\\n\\nLight microscopy of stained clinical smears, especially of fecal samples, is used to diagnose microsporidia infections.. Transmission electron microscopy is required to differentiate between species of microsporidia, but it is time consuming and expensive. Immunofluorescence Assays using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are used, and PCR has recently been employed for E. bieneusi (CDC).\\n\\n1)\\tThe infective form of E. bieneusi is the resistant spore and it can survive for a long time in the environment.2)\\tThe spore extends its polar tubule and infects the host cell.3)\\tThe spore injects the infective sporoplasm into the eukaryotic host cell through the polar tubule.4)\\tInside the cell, the sporoplasm undergoes extensive multiplication either by merogony (binary fission) or schizogony (multiple fission).5)\\tThis development occurs in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, microsporidia develop by sporogony to mature spores.6)\\tDuring sporogony, a thick wall is formed around the spore, which provides resistance to adverse environmental conditions. When the spores increase in number and completely fill the host cell cytoplasm, the cell membrane is disrupted and releases the spores to the surroundings. These free mature spores can infect new cells thus continuing the cycle (Desportes 1985).\\n\\nE. bieneusi is transported through environment resistant spores.\\n\\nCommon environmental sources of E. bieneusi include ditch and other surface waters, and several species of microsporidia can be isolated from such sources indicating that the disease may be waterborne.\\n\\nThe different modes of transmission that may be possible include the fecal-oral or oral-oral route, inhalation of aerosols, or ingestion of food contaminated with fecal material (Mathis et al. 2005). Furthermore, there seem to be a close relationship between E. bieneusi strains from humans and pigs, suggesting the absence of transmission barrier between pigs and humans for this parasite (Rinder et al. 2000).\\n\\nAnimals, particularly pigs may play a role of zoonotic reservoir in transmitting the disease to other organisms (Abreu-Acosta et al. 2005), (Lores et al. 2002). Both vertical and horizontal transmissions are possible.\\n\\nPigs, Fish, Birds, Cattle, Human, Other mammals such as monkeys\\n\\nE. bieneusi is a common parasite in pigs and it causes diarrhea, from self-limited to severe forms. This is documented by the lack of intestinal lesions in pigs experimentally infected with E. bieneusi (Mathis et al. 2005). The pigs that were infected with this disease excreted more spores.\\n\\nInhibitors of chitin synthase enzymes seem to be effective against this pathogen. Fumagilin and albendazole treatments seem promising in swine (Mathis et al. 2005)\\n\\nIt is very common in pigs and seems to be a natural pathogen in animals such as pigs (Lores et al. 2002). In some communities of pigs, the prevalence rates of E. bieneusi reached 37% (Mathias et al. 2005). There are no recorded large epidemics yet. PCR Analysis in Czech Republic revealed existence of E. bieneusi in 94% of the samples indicating the large presence of E. bieneusi in swine, and that they may be naturally occurring (Sak et al. 2008).\\n\\nSince this is a relatively new finding in pigs, the economic impact has not been studied yet. Pig farming in the US has annual revenue of $18 billion and US has about 75000 pig farms. Infection in even few pigs can be devastating as the disease is easily spread. Moreover, these pigs can serve as zoonotic reservoirs for E. bieneusi so transmission to other animals and humans is possible. Since the transmission from swine to other humans and animals is not studied yet, this may cause a major impact on the health of this country. Moreover, in other parts of the world such as China where the pig industry is major economic component and where humans and pigs live in crowded conditions, the disease can be very easily spread and can have a potentially major impact on the economy.\\n\\nMuch more work needs to be done in characterizing this pathogen as this was discovered relatively recently. Moreover, work needs to be done in studying effects in a broad range of species such as swine (not just humans) as this will reveal the multi-faceted nature of E. bieneusi. Furthermore, a concrete plan on treatment in pigs needs to be developed and its effects on specific stages of lifecycle should be measured to see where it can be effectively controlled. Also, it is not known whether E. bieneusi gets any diseases itself, and while the morbidity effects are known, the effects of this pathogen on reproduction are not known.\\n\\nDid you know that in the mid-19th century, microsporidia almost destroyed the silk industry in Europe?\\n\\nLouis Pasteur studied the disease in silkworm for 5 years and showed the farmers that the plague could be successfully overcome by microscopic examination of silkworms and ova with elimination of all those found to be diseased (Franzen 2008). Though we do not know what species of microsporidia infected the silkworm, E. bieneusi or other closely related species are possible.\\n\\nThis work was the main influence on Pasteur for his Germ Theory of Disease.\\n\\nMicrosporidia are currently under debate as an organism to be studied by mycologists or by other eukaryotic scientists. They are basal to fungi and the animal kingdoms as evidence from microsporidia's extremely puny genome.\\n\\nAbreu-Acosta, N., Lorenzo-Morales, J., Leal-Guio, Y., Coronado-Alvarez, N., Foronda, P., Alcoba-Florez, J., Izquierdo, F., Batista-Diaz, N., Del Aguila, C., & Valladares, B.

This is up from 47 on 2009, and ranks third in the Arab World and listed among the Top 10 Reformers. According to GEM 2009 Global Report, UAE has the highest increase globally in new startup activity 38% (Comparing 2006-2007) results to those in 2008-2009.\\n\\nIn the UAE NGOs are known as associations or societies for public welfare. Although the sector is relatively small, it includes a number of wealthy philanthropic organisations, which work internationally. Federal Law No. (2) of 2008 in respect of National Societies and Associations of Public Welfare defines and provides the framework for public welfare organisations operating within the UAE. This has replaced Federal Law No. (6) of 1974, and its amending laws, which previously governed public welfare societies operating within the country. \\n\\nDespite significant barriers in creating uniformed ownership laws in United Arab Emirates, the federal government has recently set a committee to draft the investment law of the country. Drafting this law has proven to be a time consuming job as each emirate in the country has different standards for foreign investment. This is because related laws such as land ownership, company formation and many others are different in all emirates. \\n\\nUAE loses 3 places in this year’s Doing Business 2011 report in the ease of getting credit-from 72nd to 69th place. Access to finance continued to be one of the leading constrains in starting a business in UAE. In 2006 survey conducted by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), entrepreneurs were forced to rely on their own social networks to source funding. Business angels, in the form of work colleagues, friends, neighbors and even strangers had been a major source of funding. Accessing to funds from commercial banks remained difficult and limited in UAE. In the joint survey of Union of Arab Banks and the World Bank on ‘The status of bank lending to SMEs in the MENA region,’ the average share of bank lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) was low- only 8% of their total lending in the MENA region. The average share of SME lending is only 2% in the GCC in 14% in the non-GCC region. According to the Dun &Bradstreet “UAE SME Lending Report” report in 2008, SMEs constitute 85% of the businesses in the UAE and banks generally reject between 50% to 70% of the credit applications. According to the report, 55% of the SMEs surveyed were not able to get the financing they needed. Interest rates for unsecured loan lending are around 15%.\\n\\nIn October 2007, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the opening of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation, which was built to support future generations in devising sustainable homegrown solutions to regional challenges by spreading knowledge throughout the region and fostering ideas and innovation. the MBR Foundation is mandated to create a wealth of regional job opportunities during the next decade. his was the first step towards diversifying and growing Arab economies, and helped pave the way for the creation of the region's first Seed Capital fund and Business Angel network, the Arab Business Angel Network (ABAN).\\n\\nThe Initial Public Offering (IPO) of stock is how many entrepreneurs and the financiers who back them make their money, rewarding the risk of investing their capital and years of very hard work.

They got married in 2007 and established a music partnership called Striking Media Music which became the label for EntropiK's releases as well as their film and media composition activities. They released their debut album \"Reflections on Time\" in 2007 shortly after changing their name from Cellofiend to EntropiK. Tracks from this album enjoyed airplay on BBC Introducing as well as numerous local community, student and internet radio stations all over the world.\\n\\nIn 2008 they were commissioned to work alongside Irish composer, Ronnie Doyle on the score for the independent feature film \"Bane\" which won Best Horror Feature at the 2008 Shriekfest Awards. During this year they also signed nonexclusive publishing agreements with Lars von Trier's film company, Zentropa and Epping film Studios based HandE Music Publishing.\\n\\nThey went on to do a critically acclaimed collaboration with German electronica duo, Ancient Astronauts in 2009 on the track \"Lost in Marrakesh\" on Ancient Atronauts album \"We Are To Answer\" (signed and released by ESL Music). The album and in particular Lost in Marrakesh received high praise from reviewers and listeners alike. Later on in that year released their second album \"Cellotronics\", tracks of which have gone on to have regular airplay on Pathaan's Musical Rickshaw on the BBC Asian Network and Tom Robisnson's BBC Introducing\\n\\nAs Cellofiend, the duo's style was New Age with a strong classical influence. As EntropiK, they maintained this style for their debut album, Reflections on Time. Following this release, they began to experiment more with the electronica elements of their music, moving away from orchestral samples and developing a more psychedelic sound. They also began digitally manipulating the cello to create contrasts between conventional sounding cello and a more synthesised, treated sound. Their 2009 release, Cellotronics features a mixture of ambient, introspective tracks chiefly inspired by the Frippertronics technique devised by Robert Fripp and made popular by Brian Eno.\\n\\nFollowing their collaboration with Ancient Astronauts in which they successfully experimented with a world music flavour they have also added this element to some of their own compositions.\\n\\nIn a live setting, EntropiK's sound leans towards certain dance genres such as trip-hop, breakbeat and downtempo but does not strictly conform to any one of these.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Entropic force", "body": "In physics, an entropic force acting in a system is a phenomenological force resulting from the entire system's statistical tendency to increase its entropy, rather than from a particular underlying microscopic force.\\n\\nA standard example of an entropic force is the elasticity of a freely-jointed polymer molecule. If the molecule is pulled into an extended configuration, the system has an increased amount of predictability. But randomly coiled configurations are overwhelmingly more probable; i.e., they have greater entropy. This results in the chain eventually returning (through diffusion) to such a configuration. To the macroscopic observer, the precise origin of the microscopic forces that drive the motion is irrelevant. The observer simply sees the polymer contract into a state of higher entropy, as if driven by an elastic force. \\n\\nthumb example of an entropic force is the hydrophobic force. It comes from the entropy of the 3D network of water molecules (at room temperature). Each water molecule is capable of\\n\\nTherefore, water molecules can form an extended three-dimensional network. Introduction of a non-hydrogen-bonding surface disrupts this network. The water molecules rearrange themselves around the surface, so as to minimize the number of disrupted hydrogen bonds. This is in contrast to hydrogen fluoride (which can accept 3 but donate only 1) or ammonia (which can donate 3 but accept only 1), which mainly form linear chains. \\n\\nIf the introduced surface had an ionic or polar nature, there would be water molecules standing more or less normal to the surface. But a non-hydrogen-bonding surface forces the surrounding hydrogen bonds to be tangential and they are locked in a clathrate-like basket shape. Water molecules involved in this clathrate-like basket around the non-hydrogen-bonding surface are constrained in their orientation. Thus, any event that would minimize such a surface is entropically favored. For example, when two such hydrophobic particles come very close, the clathrate-like baskets surrounding them merge. This releases some of the water molecules into the bulk of the water, leading to an increase in entropy. This is the basis of the so-called \"attraction\" between hydrophobic objects in water.\\n\\n140px example of a force is gravity. Some people think it is caused by the tendency toward entropy, or random mixing, or blendedness, or lack of predictability. In the image at the right, there are two galaxies. As they are, we can almost predict which star will be in which galaxy. But after they merge, we wont be able to predict this anymore. So the merger can be thought of as an attempt to increase the randomness (or blendedness) of the star locations. There are many different variations of this idea. See Entropic gravity.\\n\\nthumb example is copper. If you separate all the atoms, then the location of the single outer electrons is more predictable. But if you melt them together, then the outer electrons can be anywhere in the crystal, so the location will be more random. This is one reason why copper exists as a crystal. It also helps to explain why current (waves of probability) flows smoothly in purified metals.\\n\\nEntropic forces also occur in the physics of gases and solutions, where they generate the pressure of an ideal gas (the energy of which depends only on its temperature, not its volume), the osmotic pressure of a dilute solution, and in colloidal suspensions, where they are responsible for the crystallization of hard spheres.\\n\\nPerhaps the most important law for the modern world wide electromagnetic infrastructure is Coulomb's law. Recently, in a series of fine articles, the Coulomb law has been derived as an entropic force. The implication is that electromagnetism is of holographic origin. The classical form is\\n\\n \\n\\nbut the entropic version is\\n\\n \\n\\nwhere l is the planck length, and β and μ and are unknown yet-to-be-determined constants near one. It is argued that this new law is more accurate at very small length scales. As d becomes large, one recovers the ordinary coulomb law. The authors are able to derive the very same correction terms for Newton's law, suggesting a unification of gravity and electromagnetism based on the holographic principle, to wit:\\n\\n \\n\\n120px has been argued that the accelerating expansion of the universe, along with the pioneer anomaly, can be explained as an entropic force, without invoking arguments about dark matter or dark energy.\\n\\nIn addition, the electroweak and strong force can also be restated as entropic forces. This leads to the concept that there are no fundamental force at all.\\n\\n"}

However, they have rebounded since the 1970s as a result of intensive reforestation efforts. The country's few remaining old-growth forests are protected in nature reserves. South Korea also has 20 national parks. One of the world's most interesting wildlife sanctuaries has developed in the DMZ, having been virtually untouched since 1953. The uninhabited zone has become a haven for many kinds of wildlife, particularly migrating birds.\\n\\nLarge mammals such as tigers, bears, and lynx were once abundant throughout the Korean peninsula. However, they have virtually disappeared due to human settlement, loss of forest habitat, and over-hunting. The Siberian tiger has not been sighted in South Korea since the 1920s. Bears and wildcats can still be found in the more remote areas, such as Jiri-san and Seorak-san. South Korea also has several indigenous species of deer, including the roe deer and the Siberian musk deer. Wild boar have been growing more common in recent years, thanks to reduced hunting pressure.\\n\\nThe national flower of South Korea is the Hibiscus syriacus, a species of hibiscus that blooms continually from July through October. In South Korea, it is known as mugunghwa (무궁화), meaning \"eternal flower\". The unofficial national animal is the Tiger, for the peninsula seems like a tiger in a point of view. The unofficial national bird is the Korean magpie, which was chosen in 1964 through a poll organized by the Hankook Ilbo.\\n\\nThere are a number of environmental issues in South Korea. These include pollution, land use, and habitat preservation.\\n\\nAir pollution is a serious concern, particularly in major cities, because more than 80 percent of all South Koreans live in urban areas. Although far behind first-place United States, South Korea’s much smaller population is the ninth largest consumer of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. City sewer systems are overtaxed. Other issues include water pollution from sewer discharge and industrial effluents, acid rain, drift net fishing, and wasteful packaging of consumer goods. Transboundary pollution concerns spurred the creation of a joint commission among South Korea, Japan, and China to address environmental problems.\\n\\nThe South Korean government's July 2008 decision to boost investment into renewable energy to reduce its reliance on foreign oil imports may provide a boost to conglomerates' solar plans . The Ministry of Knowledge and Economy said the country intends to spend 194.4 billion won ($193 million) on technologies and projects, including solar, wind and biofuel, in 2008 .\\n\\nOver the centuries, Korea's inhabitants have cut down most of the ancient Korean forests, with the exception of a few remote, mountainous areas. The disappearance of the forests has been a major cause of soil erosion and flooding. Because of successful reforestation programs and the declining use of firewood as a source of energy since the 1960s, most of South Korea's hills in the 1980s were amply covered with foliage.\\n\\nNews that North Korea was constructing a huge multipurpose dam at the base of Mount Kumgang (1,638 meters) north of the DMZ caused considerable consternation in South Korea during the mid-1980s . South Korean authorities feared that once completed, a sudden release of the dam's waters into the Han River during north-south hostilities could flood Seoul and paralyze the capital region. During 1987 the Kumgang-san Dam was a major issue that Seoul sought to raise in talks with Pyongyang. Though Seoul completed the Peace Dam on the Bukhan River to counteract the potential threat of Pyongyang's dam project before the 1988 Olympics, the North Korean project apparently still was in its initial stages of construction in 1990. Construction was suspended on the dam until 1995. The second phase of construction was completed in October 2000.\\n\\n"}

It is a premiere label for Sony Music. Though it was originally conceived as a jazz imprint, it has since expanded to represent various genres.\\n\\nEpic Records was launched in 1953 by CBS for the purpose of marketing jazz, pop and classical music that did not fit the theme of the more mainstream Columbia Records. Pop talent on co-owned Okeh Records were transferred to Epic which made Okeh a rhythm and blues label. Epic's bright-yellow, black and blue logo became a familiar trademark for many jazz and classical releases. This has included such notables as the Berlin Philharmonic, Charles Rosen, the Juilliard String Quartet, Antal Doráti conducting the Hague Philharmonic and George Szell conducting the Cleveland Orchestra.\\n\\nBy 1960, the label's musical base had been expanded to include all genres. This was done in part to prevent the roster of Columbia Records (which, at the time, had a reputation for releasing material by more established acts) from being overstuffed with newer artists.  Subsequently, Epic became better known for its signing of newer, fledgling acts. By the end of the 1960s, Epic earned its first gold records and had evolved into a formidable hit-making force in rock and roll, R&B and country music. Among its many acts, it included Roy Hamilton, Bobby Vinton, The Dave Clark Five, The Hollies, Tammy Wynette, Donovan, The Yardbirds, Lulu, July and Jeff Beck. Several of the British artists on the Epic roster during the 1960s were the result of CBS's Epic/Okeh units' international distribution deal with EMI; Epic recordings were issued by EMI on the Columbia label.\\n\\nAlso during the 1960s, Epic oversaw the smaller subsidiary CBS labels including: Okeh Records and Date Records. In 1968, the Epic imprint was added in the U.K. and distributed by CBS after the distribution deal with EMI expired that year.\\n\\nEpic's commercial success continued to grow in the 1970s with releases from ABBA, Boston, Cheap Trick, The Clash, Charlie Daniels, Heart, The Isley Brothers, The Jacksons, Labelle, Johnny Nash, Ted Nugent, REO Speedwagon, Charlie Rich, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Steve Vai and Edgar Winter. Also contributing to the labels success was its distribution of Philadelphia International Records, which produced additional hit records by acts such as The Three Degrees and McFadden and Whitehead.\\n\\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Epic's mainstream success further escalated with such acts on its roster as Adam Ant, Shakin' Stevens, Cry Before Dawn, Culture Club, Dead or Alive, Céline Dion, Gloria Estefan, Europe, Cyndi Lauper, Ozzy Osbourne, Sade, Luther Vandross and Stevie Ray Vaughan. The label's greatest pay-dirt achievement came with the release Thriller, the 1982 album by Michael Jackson, which went on to achieve eighty million in international sales, becoming the biggest selling album in history.\\n\\nMore recently, other successful acts on the label have included Modest Mouse, Paloma Faith, Mudvayne, Chevelle, The Fray, Jessica Simpson, Shakira, Korn, Fiona Apple, Ozzy Osbourne, Jennifer Lopez, Rage Against the Machine, and Nate Mcdonald.\\n\\nEpic Records is today owned by Sony Music Entertainment. Sony bought CBS Records in 1987 and the company was renamed Sony Music in 1991. In February 2009, Sony Music appointed singer/songwriter Amanda Ghost president of Epic Records. Later in the year, Sony Music (during a reconsolidation of labels) merged Epic's operations with Columbia Records, and subsequently formed the Columbia/Epic Label Group — under which both labels continue to operate as separate brands. Sony Music's Legacy Recordings, in the meantime, reissues the label's classic and historical titles.\\n\\nIn addition, in the 1990s, European operations of Sony Music was integrated into two separate labels, Columbia and Epic.

{"title": "Epicyclic gearing", "body": "thumb\\n\\nEpicyclic gearing or planetary gearing is a gear system consisting of one or more outer gears, or planet gears, revolving about a central, or sun gear. Typically, the planet gears are mounted on a movable arm or carrier which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate the use of an outer ring gear or annulus, which meshes with the planet gears.\\n\\nThe axes of all gears are usually parallel, but for special cases like pencil sharpeners they can be placed at an angle, introducing elements of bevel gear (see below). Further, the sun, planet carrier and annulus axes are usually concentric.\\n\\nthumbnailthumb\\n\\nThe gear ratio in an epicyclic gearing system is somewhat non-intuitive, particularly because there are several ways in which an input rotation can be converted into an output rotation. The three basic components of the epicyclic gear are:\\n\\nIn many epicyclic gearing systems, one of these three basic components is held stationary; one of the two remaining components is an input, providing power to the system, while the last component is an output, receiving power from the system. The ratio of input rotation to output rotation is dependent upon the number of teeth in each gear, and upon which component is held stationary.\\n\\nIn other systems, such as hybrid vehicle transmissions, two of the components are used as inputs with the third providing output relative to the two inputs.\\n\\nOne situation is when the planetary carrier is held stationary, and the sun gear is used as input. In this case, the planetary gears simply rotate about their own axes at a rate determined by the number of teeth in each gear. If the sun gear has Ns teeth, and each planet gear has Np teeth, then the ratio is equal to -Ns/Np. For instance, if the sun gear has 24 teeth, and each planet has 16 teeth, then the ratio is -24/16, or -3/2; this means that one clockwise turn of the sun gear produces 1.5 counterclockwise turns of each of the planet gear(s) about its axis.\\n\\nThis rotation of the planet gears can in turn drive the annulus, in a corresponding ratio. If the annulus has Na teeth, then the annulus will rotate by Np/Na turns for each turn of the planet gears. For instance, if the annulus has 64 teeth, and the planets 16, one clockwise turn of a planet gear results in 16/64, or 1/4 clockwise turns of the annulus. Extending this case from the one above:\\n\\nSo, with the planetary carrier locked, one turn of the sun gear results in  turns of the annulus.\\n\\nThe annulus may also be held fixed, with input provided to the planetary gear carrier; output rotation is then produced from the sun gear. This configuration will produce an increase in gear ratio, equal to 1+Na/Ns.\\n\\nThese are all described by the equation:\\n\\nwhere n is the form factor of the planetary gear, defined by: \\n\\nIf the annulus is held stationary and the sun gear is used as the input, the planet carrier will be the output. The gear ratio in this case will be 1/(1+Na/Ns). This is the lowest gear ratio attainable with an epicyclic gear train. This type of gearing is sometimes used in tractors and construction equipment to provide high torque to the drive wheels.\\n\\nIn bicycle hub gear, the sun is usually stationary, being keyed to the axle or even machined directly onto it. The planetary gear carrier is used as input. In this case the gear ratio is simply given by (Ns+Na)/Na. The number of teeth in the planet gear is irrelevant.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nSome designs use \"compound planets\" which have two differently-sized gears on either end of a common casting. The large end engages the sun, while the small end engages the annulus. This may be necessary to achieve smaller step changes in gear ratio when the overall package size is limited. Compound planets have \"timing marks\" and must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and annulus at opposite ends of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. The use of compound planets is like increasing the size of the annulus; for example, compound planets with teeth in a 2:1 ratio with a 50T annulus would give the same effect as a 100T annulus, but with half the actual diameter.\\n\\nMore planet and sun gear units can be placed in series in the same annulus housing (where the output shaft of the first stage becomes the input shaft of the next stage) providing a larger (or smaller) gear ratio. This is the way some automatic transmission work.\\n\\nDuring World War II, a special variation of epicyclic gearing was developed for portable radar gear, where a very high reduction ratio in a small package was needed. This had two outer annular gears, each half the thickness of the other gears. One of these two annular gears was held fixed and had one tooth fewer than did the other. Therefore, several turns of the \"sun\" gear made the \"planet\" gears complete a single revolution, which in turn made the rotating annular gear rotate by a single tooth.right\\n\\nrightthumbnail\\n\\nIt is first drawn simplified as the sun, a single planet, the annulus, and an arm holding the planet. Any gear can be the input or output, including the arm.\\n\\nNow, put in the known values and solve for :\\n\\nor you can use the other form of this equation:\\n\\nwhere N is the number of teeth,  is angular velocity of the element (sun, arm, or ring). Since the angular velocity and rpm are directly proportional, you can use rpm instead.\\n\\nHowever, if the arm is the input or output, say the ring is the output/input instead and reverse the direction (since if the arm moves a certain speed relative to the ring, the ring moves that same speed the other way relative to the arm, and obviously the arm does not have a tooth count to plug in)\\n\\nTo derive this, just imagine the arm is locked, and calculate the gear ratio  /  = N / N, then unlock the arm. From the arms reference frame the ratio is always N/N, but from your frame all the speeds are increased by the angular velocity of the arm. So to write this relative relationship, you arrive at the equation from above.\\n\\nAlso, make sure N+2N=N where N is the number of teeth. This simply says that the gears will fit, since N is directly proportional to diameter.\\n\\nAdvantages of planetary gears over parallel axis gears include high power density, large reduction in a small volume, multiple kinematic combinations, pure torsional reactions, and coaxial shafting. Disadvantages include high bearing loads, inaccessibility, and design complexity.The planetary gearbox arrangement is an engineering design that offers many advantages over traditional gearbox arrangements. One advantage is its unique combination of both compactness and outstanding power transmission efficiencies. A typical efficiency loss in a planetary gearbox arrangement is only 3% per stage. This type of efficiency ensures that a high proportion of the energy being input is transmitted through the gearbox, rather than being wasted on mechanical losses inside the gearbox.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the planetary gearbox arrangement is load distribution. Because the load being transmitted is shared between multiple planets, torque capability is greatly increased. The more planets in the system, the greater load ability and the higher the torque density. \\n\\nThe planetary gearbox arrangement also creates greater stability due to the even distribution of mass and increased rotational stiffness.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Epidural blood patch", "body": "thumbAn epidural blood patch is a surgical procedure which uses autologous blood in order to close one or many holes in the dura mater of the spinal cord, usually as a result of a previous lumbar puncture. The procedure can be used to relieve post dural puncture headache caused by lumbar puncture (spinal tap). A small amount of the patient's blood is injected into the epidural space near the site of the original puncture; the resulting blood clot then \"patches\" the meningeal leak. The procedure carries the typical risks of any epidural puncture. However, it is effective, and further intervention is rarely necessary.\\n\\nAn epidural needle is inserted into the epidural space at the site of the cerebrospinal fluid leak and blood is injected. The clotting factors of the blood close the hole in the dura.\\n\\nAs such, the autologous blood does not \"repair\" the leak, but rather treats the patient's symptomology.\\n\\nIt is also postulated that the relief of the headache after an epidural blood patch is due to more of a compression effect than sealing the leak. Because the fluid column in the lumbar spine is continuous with the fluid around the brain, the blood exerts a \"squeeze\" and relieves the low pressure state in the head.\\n\\nTaken fromhttp://www.uwhealth.org/servlet/Satellite?cid=1105110029981&pagename=B_EXTRANET_HEALTH_INFORMATION/FlexMember/Show_Public_HFFY&c=FlexGroup\\n\\n"}

It is sometimes mistakenly labeled as a Philodendron in plant stores. \\n\\nIt is a liana growing to 20 m tall, with stems up to 4 cm diameter, climbing by means of aerial roots which hook over tree branches. The leaves are evergreen, alternate, heart-shaped, entire on juvenile plants, but irregularly pinnatifid on mature plants, up to 100 cm long and 45 cm broad (juvenile leaves much smaller, typically under 20 cm long). The flower are produced in a spathe up to 23 cm long. This plant produces trailing stems when it climbs up trees and these take root when they reach the ground and grow along it. The leaves on these trailing stems grow up to 10cm long and are the ones normally seen on this plant when it is cultivated as a pot plant.\\n\\nIt is a popular houseplant with numerous cultivar selected for leaves with white, yellow, or light green variegation. It is often used in decorative displays in shopping center, office, and other public locations largely because it is a very hardy plant that requires little care and is also attractively leafy. It is also efficient at removing indoor pollutants such as formaldehyde, xylene, and benzene A study found that this effect became less the higher the molecular weight of the polluting substance. \\n\\nAs a houseplant it can reach a height of two meters or more, given suitable support. For best results it requires medium indirect light; bright light is tolerated, but lengthy spells of direct sun will scorch the leaves. The plant prefers a temperature of between 17 to 30 °C (63 to 86 °F). Generally it only needs water when the soil begins to feel dry to the touch. For best results a liquid fertilizer can be added in spring, and they should be repotted every couple of years. However, this is a robust plant that can stand a very high degree of abuse. It will grow hydroponically quite readily.\\n\\nThe plant is listed as \"toxic to cats, toxic to dogs\" by the ASPCA, because of the presence of insoluble calcium oxalate. Care should be taken to ensure the plant is not consumed by house pets or children.

{"title": "Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh", "body": "The Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh is a diocese in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Geographically, it encompasses several counties in Western Pennsylvania, and its cathedral is located in downtown Pittsburgh. The Rt. Rev. Robert Hodges Johnson served the diocese as Assisting Bishop and was succeeded in October, 2009, by the Rt. Rev. Kenneth L. Price as provisional Bishop.\\n\\nFounded in 1865, the diocese experienced schism after its diocesan convention voted to withdraw from the Episcopal Church and join the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone in 2008. These actions, not provided for in the constitution and canons of the Episcopal Church, were believed by the Episcopal Church to be ultra vires and null. Those members remaining in the Episcopal Church reorganized the diocese, resulting in the body which is the subject of this article. Both this body and the rival Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh of the Province of the Southern Cone claim to be the true and legal successor of the pre-schism diocese. On October 5, 2009, a Pennsylvania court ruled that the diocese in communion with the Episcopal Church is the legal successor, and on October 29, the rival diocese announced it had changed its name to the Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh.\\n\\nBefore the 2008 split, the diocese included 66 individual parishes, and in 2004 had a total membership of 20,263. Because the schism is currently in progress, it is difficult to give accurate and undisputed numbers for the two bodies. In addition to its parishes, the diocese is home to numerous other Episcopal/Anglican organizations including the Community of Celebration, the Church Army, Rock the World Youth Mission Alliance, and the South American Missionary Society. Perhaps the most prominent of these is Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry, a leading conservative Evangelical seminary. The relationship of these bodies to the rival dioceses remains unclear. The diocese is also home to Progressive Episcopalians of Pittsburgh, one of the founding members of the Via Media USA coalition.\\n\\nThe Diocese of Pittsburgh covers the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania and includes the current counties of Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland. In the mid-18th century this rich transmontane area drew the first Indian traders, exploring surveyors, military men and later settlers, many of whom were at least nominal Anglicans primarily from Maryland, eastern Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\\n\\nThe earliest penetration of the southwest corner of the state, then sparsely populated with Indians, was made by Episcopalians who set up posts in the 1740s along the Allegheny, Youghiogheny and Ohio rivers. Maryland surveyor Christopher Gist crossed the mountains to survey large claims of the best farm land. On Christmas Day in 1750, Gist read Prayers and delivered a homily to Indians and traders near what is now the town of Coshocton.\\n\\nYoung George Washington, already a Virginia vestryman, was guided by Gist when he came west to warn the French to withdraw from this region claimed by the British. The French's refusal to leave led to invasion and capture of the tiny stockade built by Virginians at the future site of Pittsburgh in 1754. Washington read the burial office from the 1662 Prayer Book in 1755 when British churchman General Edward Braddock, fatally wounded while attempting to drive the French from Fort Duquesne at the Forks, was carried back over Chestnut Ridge and buried in the middle of the wagon tracks of US 40 in Fayette County. The successful 1758 campaign of British churchman General John Forbes marked the end of French control of the region.\\n\\nWhen the first new migrating settlers arrived in the 1760s, there were no settled Episcopal clergy. Laity read Morning Prayer, mainly in farm cabins but sometimes at Fort Burd or Fort Pitt, or in public houses as those were established. Before the American Revolution there were no organized Episcopal churches left anywhere in this corner of the state. Some of the more dedicated laity maintained Prayer Book worship in their homes until after the first convention of 1789, but they kept no records, elected no vestries, and built no houses for worship. From then until the 1820s, the leadership of the scattered congregations established was mainly in the hands of the few early ministers who sought ordination as Episcopalians and rode wide itinerant circuits.\\n\\nThe first known Episcopal services led by ordained clergy were conducted by the Rev. Francis Reno. In 1794 he officiated alternately at Pittsburgh and Chartiers.Other clergy resident in this western third of what was then Diocese of Pennsylvania included Robert Ayres, a Methodist ordained in 1789, residing at Brownsville, Fayette County; and Joseph Doddridge, a Methodist ordained in 1792, residing in Independence, Washington County. John Taylor, raised in Ireland and originally a Presbyterian, was ordained to the Episcopal ministry in 1794. He moved to Washington County in 1797 to teach school, and was soon invited to lead a small congregation in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nIn 1865, the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania was divided, and the western part became known as the Diocese of Pittsburgh. John Barrett Kerfoot was the first bishop of the diocese, which then included 24 counties and 28 parishes.\\n\\nthumbThe Diocese of Pittsburgh was a theologically conservative diocese within the Episcopal Church. Bishop Robert Duncan in particular had a prominent role in the conservative position within the national church. In 2003, he and a group of other conservative bishops walked out of General Convention after the House of Bishops approved Gene Robinson's election as Bishop of New Hampshire. In January 2004, Duncan was elected the first moderator of the Anglican Communion Network.\\n\\nIn 2003, Calvary Episcopal Church in Shadyside sued the diocese and Bishops Duncan and Scriven specifically over actions taken by a special convention the diocese held after the Episcopal Church's 2003 General Convention. At the special convention, the diocese had passed a resolution that asserted that all property of individual parishes belonged to the parishes themselves, rather than to the diocese. In the suit, Calvary claimed that the diocese could not take such an action, as it violated the Dennis Canon which states that parish property is held in trust for the diocese and the national church. Eventually, the suit was settled out of court. The final settlement did not affirm Calvary Church's central contention that diocesan property was held in trust for the national church, but it created a process by which the diocese agreed to make decisions about property and assets should a congregation wish to leave the diocese.\\n\\nOn November 2, 2007, the Diocese of Pittsburgh voted to change its constitution to remove accession to the constitution and canons of the Episcopal Church. The vote was 118 to 58 in the lay order and 109 to 24 in the clergy order. As a result of this action, a September 18, 2008, session of the House of Bishops deposed Bishop Duncan from ordained ministry on charges of abandoning the communion of the church.\\n\\nTo take affect, however, constitutional changes require votes at two successive annual conventions, and at its annual convention on October 4, 2008, 119 of 191 lay deputies and 121 of 160 clergy deputies voted on the second reading of constitutional changes intended to facilitate withdrawal from the Episcopal Church. In additional votes, canonical changes were approved that were intended to move the diocese into the Province of the Southern Cone. This is similar to what happened in the Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin in 2007.\\n\\nOnly one member of the diocese's Standing Committee, the ecclesiastical authority in the absence of a bishop, remained in the Episcopal Church. That member, the Rev. James Simons, appointed two additional members to the Standing Committee and informed Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori of the situation. On October 9, 2008, the Presiding Bishop acknowledged the reorganized Standing Committee as the legitimate ecclesiastical authority of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh.\\n\\nBishop David Jones, a suffragan bishop of the Diocese of Virginia, began serving as a consulting bishop on October 23 to assist the diocese in its rebuilding efforts. A special meeting of the diocesan convention was held on December 13. Twenty-seven congregations actively participated in the convention. The convention voted unanimously to reject the recent canonical changes and affirm the diocese's communion in the Episcopal Church. The Rt. Rev. Robert Hodges Johnson, the retired Bishop of Western North Carolina, accepted the call to serve as assisting bishop and to lead the diocese, for the near term.\\n\\nPittsburgh\\n\\n"}

This was, primarily, the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and three major statutory instruments protecting discrimination in employment on grounds of religion or belief, sexual orientation and age. This legislation has the same goals as the four major EU Equal Treatment Directives, whose provisions it mirrors and implements. It requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. In the case of gender, there are special protections for pregnant women. However the Act allows transsexual people to be barred from gender-specific services if that is \"a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim\".  In the case of disability, employers and service providers are under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to their workplaces to overcome barriers experienced by disabled people. In this regard, the Equality Act 2010 did not change the law. Under s.217, with limited exceptions the Act does not apply to Northern Ireland.\\n\\nThe Labour Party included a commitment to an Equality Bill in its 2005 election manifesto. The Discrimination Law Review was established in 2005 to develop the legislation and was led by the Government Equalities Office. The review considered the findings of the Equalities Review Panel, chaired by Trevor Phillips, which reported in February 2007. The Act is intended to simplify the law by bringing together existing anti-discrimination legislation. The Equality Act 2010 has replaced the Equal Pay Act 1970, Sex Discrimination Act 1975, Race Relations Act 1976, Disability Discrimination Act 1995, Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003, Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 and the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006.\\n\\nThe Act extends until 2030 the exemption from sex discrimination law allowing political parties to select all women or all men candidate short-lists. The existing exemption until 2015 was created by the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002.\\n\\nThe Parliamentary process was completed following a debate, shortly after 11pm on 6 April 2010, when amendments by the House of Lords were accepted in full.\\n\\nIn April 2008, Solicitor General Vera Baird announced that as part of the Single Equality Bill, legislation would be introduced to repeal parts of the Act of Settlement 1701 that prevent Roman Catholics or those who marry Roman Catholics from ascending to the throne, and to change the inheritance of the monarchy from cognatic primogeniture to absolute primogeniture, i.e. the first-born heir would inherit the throne regardless of his or her gender or religion. \\n\\nHowever, Attorney General The Baroness Scotland of Asthal subsequently ruled there would be no change in the law of succession in 2008, saying, \"To bring about changes to the law on succession would be a complex undertaking involving amendment or repeal of a number of items of related legislation, as well as requiring the consent of legislatures of member nations of the Commonwealth\". The published draft bill does not contain any provisions to change succession laws.\\n\\nAlthough the Act was never going to change the law from its existing position, or binding European Union law which covers many more Catholics than in the UK, and this position was spelled out in the High Court in R (Amicus) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry a small number of Roman Catholic Bishops of England and Wales made claims that they could be prosecuted under the Equality Act 2010 for refusing to allow married men, women, transsexual people and gay people into the priesthood. The legislation has also attracted criticism from local Anglican clergy. This claim has been rejected by the government. A spokesperson has said an exemption \"covers ministers of religion such as Catholic priests\" and a \"Myth Busting\" document released by the Government Equalities Office states that that \"the Equality Bill will not change the existing legal position regarding churches and employment\".\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Erdős–Straus conjecture", "body": "In number theory, the Erdős–Straus conjecture states that for all integer n ≥ 2, the rational number 4/n can be expressed as the sum of three unit fraction. Paul Erdős and Ernst G. Straus formulated the conjecture in 1948; It is one of many conjectures by Erdős.\\n\\nMore formally, the conjecture states that, for every integer n ≥ 4, there exist positive integers x, y, and z such that\\n\\nThese unit fractions form an Egyptian fraction representation of the number 4/n. For instance, for n = 1801, there exists a solution with x = 451, y = 295364, and z = 3249004:\\n\\nThe restriction that x, y, and z be positive is essential to the difficulty of the problem, for if negative values were allowed the problem could be solved trivially. Also, if n is a composite number, n = pq, then an expansion for 4/n could be found immediately from an expansion for 4/p or 4/q. Therefore, if a counterexample to the Erdős–Straus conjecture exists, the smallest n forming a counterexample would have to be a prime number, and it can be further restricted to one of six arithmetic progression modulo 840. Computer searches have verified the truth of the conjecture up to n ≤ 10, but proving it for all n remains an open problem.\\n\\nThe search for expansions of rational numbers as sums of unit fractions dates to the mathematics of ancient Egypt, in which Egyptian fraction expansions of this type were used as a notation for recording fractional quantities. The Egyptians produced tables such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus 2/n table of expansions of fractions of the form 2/n, most of which use either two or three terms.\\n\\nThe greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions, first described in 1202 by Fibonacci in his book Liber Abaci, finds an expansion in which each successive term is the largest unit fraction that is no larger than the remaining number to be represented. For fractions of the form 2/n or 3/n, the greedy algorithm uses at most two or three terms respectively. More generally, it can be shown that a number of the form 3/n has a two-term expansion if and only if n has a factor congruent to 2 modulo 3, and requires three terms in any expansion otherwise.\\n\\nThus, for the numerators 2 and 3, the question of how many terms are needed in an Egyptian fraction is completely settled, and fractions of the form 4/n are the first case in which the worst-case length of an expansion remains unknown. The greedy algorithm produces expansions of length two, three, or four depending on the value of n modulo 4; when n is congruent to 1 modulo 4, the greedy algorithm produces four-term expansions. Therefore, the worst-case length of an Egyptian fraction of 4/n must be either three or four. The Erdős–Straus conjecture states that, in this case, as in the case for the numerator 3, the maximum number of terms in an expansion is three.\\n\\nMultiplying both sides of the equation 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z by nxyz leads to an equivalent form 4xyz = n(xy + xz + yz) for the problem. As a polynomial equation with integer variables, this is an example of a Diophantine equation. The Hasse principle for Diophantine equations asserts that an integer solution of a Diophantine equation should be formed by combining solutions obtained modulo each possible prime number. On the face of it this principle makes little sense for the Erdős–Straus conjecture, as the equation 4xyz = n(xy + xz + yz) is easily solvable modulo any prime. Nevertheless, modular identities have proven a very important tool in the study of the conjecture.\\n\\nFor values of n satisfying certain congruence relations, one can find an expansion for 4/n automatically as an instance of a polynomial identity. For instance, whenever n ≡ 2 (mod 3),4/n has the expansion\\n\\nHere each of the three denominators n, (n − 2)/3 + 1, and n((n − 2)/3 + 1) is a polynomial of n, and each is an integer whenever n is 2 (mod 3).The greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions finds a solution in three or fewer terms whenever n is not 1 or 17 (mod 24), and the n ≡ 17 (mod 24) case is covered by the 2 (mod 3) relation, so the only values of n for which these two methods do not find expansions in three or fewer terms are those congruent to 1 (mod 24).\\n\\nIf it were possible to find solutions such as the ones above for enough different moduli, forming a complete covering system of congruences, the problem would be solved. However, as  showed, a polynomial identity that provides a solution for values of n congruent to r mod p can exist only when r is not a quadratic residue modulo p. For instance, 2 is a not a quadratic residue modulo 3, so the existence of an identity for values of n that are congruent to 2 modulo 3 does not contradict Mordell's result, but 1 is a quadratic residue modulo 3 so the result proves that there can be no similar identity for values of n that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\\n\\nMordell lists polynomial identities that provide three-term Egyptian fractions for 4/n whenever n is 2 mod 3 (above), 3 mod 4, 5 mod 8, 2 or 3 mod 5, or 3, 5, or 6 mod 7. These identies cover all the numbers that are not quadratic residues for those bases. However, for larger bases, not all nonresidues are known to be covered by relations of this type. From Mordell's identities one can conclude that there exists a solution for all n except possibly those that are 1, 121, 169, 289, 361, or 529 modulo 840. 1009 is the smallest prime number that is not covered by this system of congruences. By combining larger classes of modular identities, Webb and others showed that the fraction of n in the interval [1,N] that can be counterexamples to the conjecture tends to zero in the limit as N goes to infinity.\\n\\nDespite Mordell's result limiting the form these congruence identities can take, there is still some hope of using modular identities to prove the Erdős–Straus conjecture. No prime number can be a square, so by the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, whenever p is prime, there exists a larger prime q such that p is not a quadratic residue modulo q. One possible approach to proving the conjecture would beto find for each prime p a larger prime q and a congruence solving the 4/n problem for n ≡ p (mod q); if this could be done, no prime p could be a counterexample to the conjecture and the conjecture would be true.\\n\\nVarious authors have performed brute-force search for counterexamples to the conjecture; these searches can be greatly sped up by considering only prime numbers that are not covered by known congruence relations. Searches of this type by Allan Swett confirmed that the conjecture is true for all n up to 10.\\n\\nThe number of distinct solutions to the 4/n problem, as a function of n, has also been found by computer searches for small n and appears to grow somewhat irregularly with n. Starting with n = 3, the numbers of distinct solutions with distinct denominators are\\n\\nEven for larger n there can be relatively few solutions; for instance there are only seven distinct solutions for n = 73.\\n\\nThe restriction that x, y, and z be positive is essential to the difficulty of the problem, for if negative values were allowed the problem could be solved trivially via one of the two identities\\n\\nand\\n\\nAlternatively, for any odd n, a three-term solution with one negative term is possible:\\n\\nA generalized version of the conjecture states that, for any positive k there exists a number N such that, for all n ≥ N, there exists a solution in positive integers to k/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z. The version of this conjecture for k = 5 was made by Wacław Sierpiński, and the full conjecture is due to Andrzej Schinzel.\\n\\nEven if the generalized conjecture is false for any fixed value of k, then the number of fractions k/n with n in the range from 1 to N that do not have three-term expansions must grow only sublinearly as a function of N. In particular, if the Erdős–Straus conjecture itself (the case k = 4) is false, then the number of counterexamples grows only sublinearly. Even more strongly, for any fixed k, only a sublinear number of values of n need more than two terms in their Egyptian fraction expansions. The generalized version of the conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the number of unexpandable fractions is not just sublinear but bounded.\\n\\nWhen n is an odd number, by analogy to the problem of odd greedy expansion for Egyptian fractions, one may ask for solutions to k/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z in which x, y, and z are distinct positive odd numbers. Solutions to this equation are known to always exist for the case that k = 3.\\n\\n"}

From 1943 to 1945 he served as a soldier in an anti-aircraft unit. He passed his A-level exams in 1946 and studied English, German and history at Frankfurt, Berne and Tuebingen universities in order to be a teacher. In 1951 he did a PhD with a thesis on Elizabethan tragedy, and after completing his teacher training, he worked as a grammar school teacher in Schwenningen on the Neckar from 1953 until 1961.\\n\\nEppler became a member of the NSDAP in September 1943, at the age of 16. Later he spoke of this step as a \"stupidity\", but he also says, \"It wasn't against my will that I ended up on some list\" (of members of the NSDAP), \"but I accepted it. Things were like that in those times.\" \\n\\nWhile he was studying in Berne at the end of the 1940s, Eppler got to know Gustav Heinemann, one of the founders of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Heinemann became Minister of the Interior from 1949 to 1950, but then left the cabinet and later also the CDU together with several other party members who disagreed with Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's policy of complete integration into the Western world. Eppler joined Heinemann's new party, the All-German People's Party (Gesamtdeutsche Volkspartei - GVP), in 1952, but like most members of the GVP, including Heinemann, he changed over to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1956 after the GVP only attracted small numbers of voters in elections. The fact that active members of the Protestant Church like Eppler and Heinemann joined the SPD helped that party to overcome the prejudice that it was an \"atheist\" party, and that Christian values were only represented in the CDU.\\n\\nDuring most years between 1970 and 1991 Eppler belonged to the SPD's National Executive Committee. He also chaired an SPD commission on tax reform, and a commission for formulating the party's basic values.\\n\\nFrom 1973 to 1981 Eppler was the leader of the regional SPD in Baden-Württemberg. He was the SPD's candidate for the office of Prime Minister in that state, but his party was defeated by the CDU in the Baden-Wuerttemberg elections of 1976 and 1980.\\n\\nErhard Eppler was an MP in the parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Bundestag, from 1961 to 1976. Between 1972 and 1976 he represented the constituency of Heilbronn there. From 1976 he represented the constituency of Rottweil in the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg, the parliament of one of the states of which the Federal Republic consists. Until 1980 he was leader of the parliamentary SPD in the Landtag. On June 30, 1982, he resigned as an MP, after his election defeats of 1976 and 1980.\\n\\nOn October 16, 1968, Eppler was appointed Minister for Economic Cooperation in the \"Grand Coalition\" government of Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger (CDU) and Foreign Minister Willy Brandt (SPD). He continued in that office when Willy Brandt became Chancellor in 1969, but after his department was subject to severe cuts under the following Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt (SPD), in 1974, he stepped down in protest. \\n\\nIn his book \"Not much time for the Third World\", Eppler was one of the first to point out the connections between the protection of the environment and international development.\\n\\nEppler has always been considered to be an exponent of the left within the SPD. During Gerhard Schröder's second term as Chancellor (2002–2005), however, he supported the government's economic and social reforms, which were widely criticized as Neo-liberal (Agenda 2010). Moreover, although he had been close to the Peace movement of the nineteen-eighties, he supported the foreign policy of the Schröder government and approved of German participation in the military interventions in Kosovo in 1999 and in Afghanistan since 2001. But in spite of his general loyalty to his party's leadership, he was unhappy especially with much of its economic policy when in government.\\n\\nAfter his retreat from federal politics, Eppler involved himself more in his work in the Protestant Church. From 1981 to 1983 and from 1989 to 1991 he was president of the Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag (\"German Protestant Church Congress\").\\n\\nHe is also a member of the \"Wacholderhof Association\", which promotes international cooperation, fair trade, and environmental sustainability, and of the \"Association of Protestant Academics in Germany\".\\n\\nEppler's numerous publications show his political and social involvement, too. They deal with a wide range of subjects which concern the political situation in Germany, the economy, but also general questions of developments in politics and society. In 2006, one of his books on the role of the state was honoured with the prize Das politische Buch 2006 by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\n"}

His father and mother taught him themselves in his early years, and Toelken especially emphasizes the religious and cultural education he gained from his mother, saying that \"totam sese educationi meae addixit\". Toelken lost his father early in life and was in later years raised by his grandfather, the businessman Ernst Trüper. Toelken went to several Bildungsanstalten and schools in his home town, including the \"Rothen Waisenhauses\", and then spent 1794-1802 at the \"Pädagogium\", studying in the top class and graduating with honours. Toelken next took the opportunity to continue his education privately, particularly in modern languages (French, English and Italian or, in his words, \"Galliam, Anglicam et Italieam\"), which he studied under several teachers. Because at that time not all public schools taught ancient Greek, Toelken decided to teach himself it:\\n\\nand so taught himself using material otherwise way beyond a beginner. In his mathematical inclinations, he was supported by Dr. G. R. Treviranus, who taught him the principles of spherical trigonometry.\\n\\nOn the 25th April 1804 Toelken, aged 18 and as the son of Heinrich Toelken's widow, he matriculate in the theological faculty of the Georgia Augusta at Göttingen, \"cui destinatus eram\" (as I was destined to be\"). Already in the first of his seven semesters there he shifted his focus, opting not for Eichhorn's and Planck's theological courses but instead increasingly for history, philosophy and philology, though still linking them back into theology. With his mother's approval, he used the autumn of his first semester to take the first of his characteristic trips, this time through Germany and Switzerland, of which trip he notes: \"idque pene totum pedibus confeci\". On returning to Göttingen, he resumed his multilateral studies, spending a year under professor Thibaut studying the Analysis of finite and infinite sizes, stating later that \"Scientias quoque naturae indagatries, physicam et chemicam paululum attigi.\" The studies in ancient and recent history became more and more significant. At the midpoint of his study at Göttingen, he studied under Herbart, though perhaps on material he had already learned in Bremen. Toelken also a member of Herbart's secret society:\\n\\nProfessor Herbart had many highly talented students, who combined a variety of philological and pedagogic interests characteristic for the \"Neuhumanisten\" (New Humanists), including Ernst Karl Friedrich Wunderlich, Georg Ludolf Dissen, Friedrich Thiersch and Friedrich Kohlrauschan.\\n\\nHe was a member of the Gesetzlose Gesellschaft zu Berlin, a social society founded in Berlin in 1809 in the aftermath of the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt to press for the reform of Prussia government and society. \\n\\nHe and Osiander were rare among the private instructors (Privatdozenten) of their time in being able to undertake foreign travel and a \"grand tour\".\\n\\nAt the age of 30 he became Professor of Art History at Berlin University. He was tutor to Franz Woepcke during his maths dissertation there.\\n\\nHe was appointed director of the Antiquarium, or Cabinet of Antiquities, at the Berlin Museum in 1832, and also became its vice-president. \\n\\nA set of 419 plaster impressions of Prince Stanisław Poniatowski's (1754-1833) gem collection were presented to the King of Prussia by the prince himself (they now form the Daktyliothek Poniatowski in Berlin). They were shown to Toelken in 1832, and he was the first to doubt that the original gems were ancient, noticing that (from the known signatures of Graeco-Roman engravers) the signatures on these gems suggested that engravers working centuries apart were producing gems that were impossibly identical in style, and stating \"Thus, we have here, -- and I am extremely sorry to give this hard judgement! -- in works and words a scientific deceit of such dimensions never seen in art history before.\" He did, however, judge their classical style with great admiration, and commented that the impressions were \"indeed the most beautiful you can expect to see in art\". \\n\\nAs a secretary of the Königlichen Akademie der Künste, he was co-signatory and co-author of an 1844 letter of thanks from it to the composer Franz Commer.\\n\\n"}

Also there as a subordinate to Field Marshal Keitel was Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg who arrived clutching a briefcase. As Stauffenberg was disabled following the loss of his right hand and two fingers from his left hand, von Freyend offered to carry it for him. Stauffenberg at first refused, but then relented upon approaching the conference room and he asked von Freyend to put him as near as possible to Hitler so that 'I catch everything the Führer says for my briefing afterwards'. Freyend placed the briefcase by the conference map table to the right of General Adolf Heusinger who was standing next to Hitler and Stauffenberg adjusted its position. However, Heinz Brandt, wanting to get a closer look at a map on the table, re-positioned the briefcase farther away from Hitler on the other side of a thick table leg. Seven minutes later the bomb exploded.

The former station building (see below) has been converted into an information centre and fronts onto Luxembourg Square.\\n\\nThe mall itself covers a once over-ground railway station, the Brussels-Luxembourg Station (formerly known as the Leopold Quarter station). The paving over the top of the station allowed the construction of Parliament and created a direct link between Luxembourg Square to the west and Leopold Park to the east. The train station's old entrance, since converted into part of the Parliamentary complex, is replaced by a glass covered stairway rising out of the mall's southern portion. The far south end is flanked by low-rise apartment blocks and is adjacent to local museums.\\n\\nIt has been criticised for \"leading nowhere\" as, aside from the Parliament and railway station, the mall is devoid of life. Parliamentary authorities did not wish to share the site with private enterprise, and hence there are no shops or services along its entire length. There are plans to extend it along the railway tracks to the north, meeting up with the Berlaymont on the Rue de la Loi and to the south, so the Commission's extra 'pole' of buildings in Auderghem however residential opposition and delays mean this is not likely and it was not included as an option in recent architectural competitions.\\n\\nThe mall is largely light pink and white flagstone, with the southern segment broken by grassy areas running down its centre. It curves following the layout of the train station below and the Parliamentary buildings above built around the tracks. In the stone in the northern segment are engraved marble slabs in the ground commemorating the first meeting of the World Day to Overcome Extreme Poverty on 17 October 1987 in Paris. They are written in four languages and contains a quote from Joseph Wresinski and a commemoration of the 29 May 2002 follow up meeting in Brussels.\\n\\nIn the re-planning of the European Quarter, the \"public stature\" of the mall is to be reinforced, along with the east-west connections. The northern end, which cuts off suddenly at Rue Belliard, is to be improved, subject to an architecture competition. The southern segment will also be improved with better connections to residences, the park and the local museums. The government also seeks ideas on how to bring more life to the mall.\\n\\nAccording to Brussels' government, the term the mall, translated from the French le mail, was given by the designers due to the origin of the word mail. The etymology of mail refers to the game, mail (a form of croquet) which was played in 16th century France on a raised grassy valley adjoining the Tuileries Palace Gardens. The proximity of Leopold Park to the esplanade, which was originally higher, led the designers to apply the term.\\n\\nThe central portion of the mall, at the main entrance to the Spinelli building leading to the Place Luxembourg, is to be named the Agora of Solidarity. This alludes to the Solidarność trade union and social movement, which is a symbol of the fight against the Iron Curtain because it played a central role in bringing Poland's suppressive Communist regime to an end in the 1989.\\n\\n"}

The school's sports team is the Hornets and the school's colors are blue and gold. Essex High School is the largest public secondary school in Chittenden County, Vermont. Enrollment in 2004 was 1625.\\n\\nThe school was established in 1957 as Essex Junction High School. In 1970, a new, larger campus was constructed about  away, containing both the high school and a technical center. This new campus was named the Essex Junction Educational Center (EJEC), while the former building became Albert D. Lawton Middle School. In the 1990s, the school's name was changed to Essex High School to reflect the two communities it served, Essex and Essex Junction.\\n\\nThe original EJHS building was designed for future expansion by the addition of a second story. However, when more classrooms were needed in the 1980s, new building codes required any renovations to bring the entire old building \"up to code,\" at great cost. A new two-story \"C wing\" and courtyard were added to the east side instead. In 2002, a new library and media center were built east of the C wing.\\n\\nThe school is accredited as a public secondary school by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and by the Vermont Department of Education. EHS adjoins the Center for Technology, Essex, a technical and vocational school. Students can enroll concurrently in both high school and technical programs; approximately ten percent of students do so each year. A four-year Air Force Junior ROTC program is offered.\\n\\nThe school has accelerated programs in Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, French and Spanish; honors courses in English and Mathematics; and a selection of fourteen Advanced Placement courses. Not all AP courses are taught each year. The school also offers students media and computer facilities.\\n\\nIn 2008, EHS students earned the county's best math scores on the New England Common Assessment Program test.\\n\\nTuition was $11,900 in 2009-2010. This tuition was paid by towns sending students to this public school, sometimes from outside the school district.\\n\\nThere are 31 clubs and 18 sports including:\\n\\nThe school has a stadium, track, tennis courts, and several practice fields. The town’s indoor hockey rink is located on school grounds. School teams and student athletes have won over 200 Vermont State Championships since 1970. This figure includes 63 individual track records set by various girl and boy athletes.\\n\\n"}

This structure holds various events, such as concerts and religious gatherings and mass. Its official name Estadio José María Morelos y Pavón was put in place to honor this hero of the Mexican War of Independence\\n\\nThe stadium has an irregular shape, because the areas behind the goals only have one level and 32 stands, along the side there are 4 levels (one grandstand, one other seating area and 2 box areas) and 49 stands. \\n\\nThe total capacity of seated spectators is 41,500 making it the seventh largest stadium in Mexico, only behind Estadio Azteca, Estadio Olímpico Universitario, Estadio Jalisco, Estadio Omnilife, Estadio Cuauhtémoc and Estadio Universitario.\\n\\nThe city of Morelia before the existence of this structure, counted on the Estadio Venustiano Carranza as the home of first division side, Atlético Morelia, currently Monarcas Morelia. In 1984, 2 years before the 1986 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico, it was officially announced that Morelia would be one of the sites for the tournament, and a scale model of the new stadium was shown, very similar in capacity and structure to the Estadio Corregidora of Santiago de Querétaro, and would be located in the Southeast of the city, on the current grounds of the sport unit of Adolfo López Mateos. Excavation work soon began but problems in the foundation led to the suspension of the work and no other sites were sought. The World Cup site was transferred to the Estadio Sergio León Chavez, in Irapuato.\\n\\nFollowing the league tournaments of 1986-1987 1987-1988, despite not reaching the finals, the local side put on 2 brilliant displays in the liguilla. Demand for the new structure resurged. A group of Michoacan businessmen led by Luis Álvarez Barreiro, and with support from the new governor, Luis Martínez Villicaña, created a pro-construction sponsorship which was financed privately by ticket sales. At the conclusion of the construction, the sponsorship was handed over to the state of Michoacan. The stadium will be one of the venues for the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\\n\\nMorelos\\n\\n"}

E. W. \"Skip\" Etchells, a boat designer, builder and sailor, was interested in the competition, but refrained from producing a design until the trials were announced. However, once the details became available, he built the wooden Shillalah, taking her to Kiel, Germany, where the trials were to be held in the fall of 1966.\\n\\nShillalah performed well at the trials, winning eight of the ten races. Nevertheless, the judges were unable to agree on a winner, and thus a second set of trials were held in Travemünde the following year. For these trials Etchells rebuilt the boat in fiberglass, using the original Shillalah as a plug. As with the first trials, Shillalah II (as the new boat was named) dominated the races, winning ten out of the thirteen that were held, and only just missing out on an eleventh.\\n\\nAt the completion of the trials the judges chose the Soling over Shillalah II, in spite of her success in the races. However, the boat's performance had won converts, and shortly thereafter the boat entered production with orders for an initial 12 boats. With the formation of a new association the class became known as the E22, and 32 boats were built by Etchells' company by the end of 1969.\\n\\nThe class was known as E22 until the name was changed to Etchells in 1990. Over the years, the Etchells has become increasingly popular and is now raced by members of more than fifty fleets around the world. \\n\\nThe Etchells is a fast, stable racing sloop that can be raced competitively and safely by three or four sailors. She can tack in 70 degrees and is extremely sensitive to subtle adjustments in tuning and trim. She has a sleek hull with relatively little wetted surface area, which allows her to move well in the lightest breeze. In heavier winds, she absolutely flies. Her sail plan includes a main, jib, and spinnaker. \\n\\nThe class's strict one-design principles were established in the late 1960s and are controlled today by a strong, well-managed class association. The class and the International Sailing Federation maintain tight control of the construction of these yachts, ensuring the high quality and uniformity of each Etchells built. The one-design principles help the Etchells hold her resale value exceptionally well. \\n\\nThe Etchells is a fiberglass boat with aluminum spars; it has no electrical systems or auxiliary power. It is trailerable and light enough to drysail. The materials and techniques used in her construction make her easy to maintain and repair. \\n\\nFamous Etchells sailors include: \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Eternal Warrior", "body": "Gilad Anni-Padda aka the Eternal Warrior is the title character of a 50-issue comic book series by Valiant Comics that ran from 1992 to 1996. Eternal Warrior was relaunched with the other Valiant characters under the banner of Acclaim Comics in 1996 (video game company Acclaim Entertainment purchased Valiant Comics for $65 million in June 1994). Valiant Entertainment, Inc. is the owner of the Valiant catalog (including Eternal Warrior).\\n\\nOne of three natural human immortals, Gilad is the brother of Ivar the Timewalker and Aram the Other (AKA Armstrong). The three brothers are the only naturally immortal humans known to exist. He serves as the \"Fist and Steel\" of the Geomancers and has served them for millennia. Like his brothers, Gilad has superhuman strength (though not as great as Aram's) and stamina, as well as a healing ability which allows him to regenerate virtually any wound. Gilad's people once said that he carried within him the \"Leopard Spirit.\"\\n\\nBravest of a warrior tribe, Gilad Anni-Padda was born in 3268 BC. His skill at battlecraft and the arts of stealth are great, as he has honed them throughout the ages. With an ultra-dense cellular structure that gives him great strength and the ability to heal from the most grievous of wounds, Gilad Anni-Padda is even immune to the ravages of time. The greatest fighter from an age when the sword was the law, he was ancient before the rise of the Pharaohs, and shall survive the fall of nations yet to come. He is the Fist and Steel of those who guard the Earth - the Geomancers, and his battle is never-ending.\\n\\nIn 3257 BC, at the age of eleven, Gilad emerged victorious from his first battle. In 3250, Gilad's first son, Kalam, was born. In 3219 BC, Gilad and Aram's tribe battled the superior weaponry of the Mesopotamians and lost, with the warriors of Mesopotamia advancing to Gilad's camp. All of the people were killed with the exception of Gilad, Aram, and Kalam. The brothers split up, Gilad traveling with the Geomancer of the day and Aram seeking a new family and a less violent life. Centuries passed and the brothers saw each other on occasion but have largely led separate lives.\\n\\nIn 210 BC, Gilad first battled the Immortal Enemy, then known as General Cheng, who can reincarnate through the ages, always doing evil and seeking Gilad's destruction. Every time the Immortal Enemy reincarnates his eyes remain the same, one green and the other brown.\\n\\nIn World War II, Gilad meets Neville Alcott at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940. Alcott would later serve to aid the Eternal Warrior's causes.\\n\\nIn the early 1990s, Gilad (now known as Gilad Abrams) fought the Immortal Enemy's latest incarnation, a Colombian drug lord Juan Javier Caldone.

After releasing two successful solo albums and one album of remixes, since the last Fischer-Z album, Stream, John Watts had started to take an interest in creating big beat music. After creating a whole big beat style album in 1999 entitled Bigbeatpoetry, Watts carried on in a similar style for Ether. He recorded a number of songs, featuring only his guitar and voice, and then put them over cut-up beats as a rhythm track. Watts had also added a filmic touch to the project, he travelled throughout Europe and post-9/11 New York City to find musicians at random and record them using his laptop, in their homes and on the street.

{"title": "Ethical egoism", "body": "Ethical egoism (also called simply egoism) is the normative ethical position that moral agent ought to do what is in their own self-interest. It differs from psychological egoism, which claims that people can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from rational egoism, which holds merely that it is rational to act in one's self-interest. These doctrines may, though, be combined with ethical egoism.\\n\\nEthical egoism contrasts with ethical altruism, which holds that moral agents have an obligation to help and serve others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical utilitarianism, which holds that a moral agent should treat one's self (also known as the subject) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and \"the self\" to a status not granted to others), but that one also should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own desires or well-being) are substantially-equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of consequentialism, but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both agent-focused forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or subjective), but utilitarianism is called agent-neutral (i.e. objective and impartial) as it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral \"agent's\") own interests as being more or less important than the interests, desires, or well-being of others.\\n\\nEthical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. Individualism allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily entail that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfillment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to the self. Fleeting pleasure, then, takes a back seat to protracted eudaimonia. In the words of James Rachels, \"Ethical egoism [...] endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness.\"\\n\\nEthical egoism is sometimes the philosophical basis for support of libertarianism or individualist anarchism, although these can also be based on altruistic motivations. These are political positions based partly on a belief that individuals should not coercively prevent others from exercising freedom of action.\\n\\nThree different formulations of ethical egoism have been identified: individual, personal and universal. An individual ethical egoist would hold that all people should do whatever benefits them; a personal ethical egoist would hold that he or she should act in his or her own self-interest, but would make no claims about what anyone else ought to do; a universal ethical egoist would argue that everyone should act in ways that are in their own interest. according to Deepak Patidars\\n\\nA philosophy holding that one should be honest, just, benevolent etc., because those virtues serve one's self-interest is egoistic; one holding that one should practice those virtues for reasons other than self-interest is not egoistic.\\n\\nMax Stirner was the first philosopher to call himself an egoist, it is questionable if he wanted to install a new idea of morality (ethical egoism) or argue against morality (amoralism). Others, such as Thomas Hobbes and David Gauthier, have argued that the conflicts which arise when people each pursue their own ends can be resolved for the best of each individual only if they all voluntarily forgo some of their aims that is, one's self-interest is often best pursued by allowing others to pursue their self-interest as well so that liberty is equal among individuals. Sacrificing one's short-term self-interest to maximize one's long-term self-interest is one form of \"rational self-interest\" which is the idea behind most philosophers' advocacy of ethical egoism. Egoists have also argued that one's actual interests are not immediately obvious, and that the pursuit of self-interest involves more than merely the acquisition of some good, but the maximizing of one's chances of survival and/or happiness. \\n\\nNoted egoist Ayn Rand argued that there is a positive harmony of interests among free, rational humans, such that no moral agent can rationally coerce another person consistently with his own actual, long-term self-interest. Rand argued that other people are an enormous value to an individual's well-being (through education, trade and affection), but also that this value could be fully realized only under conditions of political and economic freedom. According to Rand, voluntary trade alone can assure that human interaction is mutually beneficial. Rand's student, Leonard Peikoff has argued that the identification of one's interests itself is impossible absent the use of principles, and that self-interest cannot be consistently pursued absent a consistent adherence to certain ethical principles. Recently, Rand's position has also been defended by such writers as Tara Smith, Tibor Machan, Allan Gotthelf, David Kelley, Douglas Rasmussen, Nathaniel Branden, Harry Binswanger, Andrew Bernstein and Craig Biddle in his 2002 work, Loving Life: The Morality of Self-Interest and the Facts that Support It.\\n\\nPhilosopher David L. Norton identified himself an \"ethical individualist,\" and, like Rand, saw a harmony between an individual's fidelity to his own self-actualization, or \"personal destiny,\" and the achievement of society's well being.\\n\\nGerman philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche suggested that egoistic or \"life-affirming\" behavior stimulates jealousy or \"ressentiment\" in others, and that this is the psychological motive for the altruism in Christianity. Sociologist Helmut Schoeck similarly considered envy the motive of collective efforts by society to reduce the disproportionate gains of successful individuals through moral or legal constraints, with altruism being primary among these. \\n\\nIn addition, Nietzsche (in Beyond Good and Evil) and Alasdair MacIntyre (in After Virtue) have pointed out that the ancient Greeks did not associate morality with altruism in the way that post-Christian Western civilization has done.Aristotle's view is that we have duties to ourselves as well as to other people (e.g. friends) and to the polis as a whole. The same is true for Thomas Aquinas, Christian Wolff and Immanuel Kant, who claim that there are duties to ourselves as Aristotle did, although it has been argued that, for Aristotle, the duty to one's self is primary.\\n\\nThe term ethical egoism has been applied retroactively to philosophers such as Bernard de Mandeville and to many other materialist of his generation, although none of them declared themselves to be egoists. Note that materialism does not necessarily imply egoism, as indicated by Karl Marx, and the many other materialist who espoused forms of collectivism.\\n\\nIt has been argued that ethical egoism lends itself to individualist anarchism, as in the work of Murray Rothbard, and is another way of describing the sense that the common good should be enjoyed by all. However, most notable anarchists in history have advocated altruistic views.\\n\\nJames Rachels, in an essay that takes as its title the theory's name, outlines the three arguments most commonly touted in its favour:\\n\\nRand has argued that a form of egoism, although inconsistent and incomplete, was one of the revolutionary aspects the American Revolution, citing evidence such as the natural \"right to pursue happiness\" found in the Declaration of Independence, and further argued that the capitalistic \"profit motive\" which characterized 19th Century American history was essential to the rapid economic and cultural development that the nation also experienced.\\n\\nAccording to amoralism, there is nothing wrong with egoism, but there is nothing ethical about it. One can simply adopt rational egoism and completely drop morality as a superfluous attribute of the egoism.\\n\\nSome contend that ethical egoism is intuitively implausible,\\n\\nEthical egoism has also been alleged as the basis for immorality. Thomas Jefferson writes in a 1814 letter to Thomas Law:\\n\\nIn contrast, Rand saw ethics as a necessity for human survival and well-being, and argued that the \"social\" implications of morality, including natural rights, were simply a subset of the wider field of ethics. Thus, for Rand, \"virtue\" included productiveness, honesty with oneself, and scrupulousness of thought. Although she greatly admired Jefferson, she also wrote:\\n\\nEthical egoism is opposed not only by altruist philosophers; it is also at odds with the majority of religion. Most religions hold that ethical egoism is the product of a lack of genuine spirituality and shows an individual's submersion in greed. Religious egoism is a derivative of egoism, whereby religion is used to validate one's self-interest.\\n\\nIn The Moral Point of View, Kurt Baier objects that ethical egoism provides no moral basis for the resolution of conflicts of interest, which, in his opinion, form the only vindication for a moral code. (It should be noted that Baier does not account for Rand's arguments.) Were this an ideal world, one in which interests and purposes never jarred, its inhabitants would have no need of a specified set of ethics, according to Baier. This, however, is not an \"ideal world.\" Baier believes that ethical egoism fails to provide the moral guidance and arbitration that it necessitates. Far from resolving conflicts of interest, claimed Baier, ethical egoism all too often spawns them. To this, as Rachels has shown, the ethical egoist may object that he cannot admit a construct of morality whose aim is merely to forestall conflicts of interest. \"On his view,\" he writes, \"the moralist is not like a courtroom judge, who resolves disputes. Instead, he is like the Commissioner of Boxing, who urges each fighter to do his best.\"\\n\\nBaiers is also part of a team of philosophers who hold that ethical egoism is paradoxical, implying that to do what is in one's best interests can be both wrong and right in ethical terms. Although a successful pursuit of self-interest may be viewed as a moral victory, it could also be dubbed immoral if it prevents another person from executing what is in his best interests. Again, however, the ethical egoist have responded by assuming the guise of the Commissioner of Boxing. His philosophy precludes empathy for the interests of others, so forestalling them is perfectly acceptable. \"Regardless of whether we think this is a correct view,\" adds Rachels, \"it is, at the very least, a consistent view, and so this attempt to convict the egoist of self-contradiction fails.\"\\n\\nFinally, it has been averred that ethical egoism is no better than bigotry in that, like racism, it divides people into two types — themselves and others — and discriminates against one type on the basis of some arbitrary disparity. This, to Rachels's mind, is probably the best objection to ethical egoism, for it provides the soundest reason why the interests of others ought to concern the interests of the self. \"[W]hat,\" he asks, \"is the difference between myself and others that justifies placing myself in this special category? Am I more intelligent? Do I enjoy my life more? Are my accomplishments greater? Do I have needs or abilities that are so different from the needs and abilities of others? What is it that makes me so special? Failing an answer, it turns out that Ethical Egoism is an arbitrary doctrine, in the same way that racism is arbitrary. [...] We should care about the interests of other people for the very same reason we care about our own interests; for their needs and desires are comparable to our own.\"\\n\\nIt has been observed, however, that the very act of eating (especially, when there are others starving in the world) is such an act of self-interested discrimination. Egoists such as Rand who readily acknowledge the (conditional) value of others to an individual, and who readily endorse empathy for others, have argued the exact reverse from Rachels, that it is altruism which discriminates: \"If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, then why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others?\" It is, thus, altruism which is the arbitrary position, according to Rand.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ethnolichenology", "body": "Ethnolichenology is the study of the relationship between lichens and people. Lichens have and are being used for many different purposes by human cultures on every continent, with the possible exception of Australia. The most common human use of lichens is for dye, but they are also frequently used for medicine and food. Different human cultures across the world have also found many other more novel uses for lichens.\\n\\nLichens are a common source of natural dye. The lichen dye is usually extracted by either boiling water or ammonia fermentation. Although usually called ammonia fermentation, this method is not actually a fermentation and involves letting the lichen steep in ammonia (traditionally urine) for at least two to three weeks.\\n\\nIn North America the most significant lichen dye is Letharia vulpina. Indigenous people through most of this lichen's range in North America traditionally make a yellow dye from this lichen by boiling it in water.\\n\\nHistorically, traditional dyes in Scotland were very important. Brown lichen dyes (called crottle) and red lichen dyes (called corkir) were used extensively to produce tartan.\\n\\nPurple dyes from lichens were historically very important throughout Europe from the 15th to 17th centuries. They were generally extracted from Roccella spp. lichens imported from the Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands, Madagascar, or India. These lichens, and the dye extracted from them, are called orchil (variants archil, orchilla). The same dye was also produced from Ochrolechia spp. lichens in Britain and was called cudbear. Both Roccella spp. and Ochrolechia spp. contain the lichen substance orcin, which converts into the purple dye orcein in the ammonia fermentation process.\\n\\nLitmus, a water soluble pH indicator dye mixture is also extracted from Roccella species.\\n\\nMany lichens have been used medicinally across the world. A lichen's usefulness as a medicine is often related to the lichen secondary compounds that are abundant in most lichen thalli. Different lichens produce a wide variety of these compounds, most of which are unique to lichens and many of which are antibiotic. It has been estimated that 50% of all lichen species have antibiotic properties. Many lichen extracts have been found to be effective in killing Gram-positive bacteria, which included species that cause boils, scarlet fever, and pneumonia \\n\\nOne of the most potent lichen antibiotics is usnic acid, as a result ''Usnea'' spp. are commonly used in traditional medicines. Usnea was used in the United States as a fungal remedy of the mouth, stomach, intestines, anus, vagina, nose, ear, and skin, and in Finland it was used to treat wounds, skin eruptions, and athlete’s foot. In Russia a preparation of the sodium salt of usnic acid was sold under the name Binan for the treatment of varicose and trophic ulcers, second and their degree burns, and for plastic surgery.\\n\\nOther lichens commonly featured in folk medicines include Iceland moss and Lungwort.\\n\\nthumbOnly a few lichens are truly poisonous, with species of Letharia and Vulpicida being the primary examples. These lichens are yellow because they have high concentrations of the bright yellow toxin vulpinic acid.\\n\\nWolf lichen (Letharia vulpicida) was used in Scandinavia to poison wolves. The process begins by adding the lichens to various baits such as reindeer blood and other meats, while sometimes mixing the concoction with ground glass or strychnine. Unfortunate wolves that ate the concoction were reported to succumb in less than 24 hours. The Achomawi people of northern California use Letharia to poison arrowheads. The arrowheads would be soaked in the lichens for a year sometimes with the addition of rattlesnake venom. Although toxic, wolf lichens were used to treat sores and inflammation by indigenous people in north California and southern British Columbia, and even taken internally as medicine.\\n\\nthumbThere are records of lichens being used as food by many different human cultures across the world. Lichens are eaten by people in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, and perhaps elsewhere. Often lichens are merely famine food eaten in times of dire needs, but in some cultures lichens are a staple food or even a delicacy. Two problems often encountered with eating lichens is that they usually contain mildly toxic secondary compounds, and that lichen polysaccharides are generally indigestible to humans. Many human cultures have discovered preparation techniques to overcome these problems. Lichens are often thoroughly washed, boiled, or soaked in ash water to help remove secondary compounds.\\n\\nIn the past Iceland moss (Cetraria islandica) was an important human food in northern Europe and Scandinavia, and was cooked in many different ways, such as bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or salad. Wila (Bryoria fremontii) was an important food in parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked. It is even featured in a Secwepemc story. Reindeer lichen (Cladina spp.) is a staple food of reindeer and caribou in the Arctic. Northern peoples in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested lichen after they remove it from the rumen of caribou that have been killed. It is often called 'stomach icecream'. Rock tripe (Umbilicaria spp. and Lasalia spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in North America. One species of Umbilicaria, Iwa-take (U. esculenta), is used in a variety of traditional Korean and Japanese foods. It is quite expensive, and is collected off the sides of cliffs. In India, and other centers of curry powder production, garam masala sauce contains certain lichens used as bulking agents.\\n\\nVery few lichens are poisonous. Poisonous lichens include those high in vulpinic acid or usnic acid. Most (but not all) lichens that contain vulpinic acid are yellow, so any yellow lichen should be considered to be potentially poisonous.\\n\\nthumbEmbalming began in Egypt about 5,000 years ago, and the use of lichens in embalming can be seen dating back to the 18th Dynasty where Pseudevernia furfuracea was found in an Egyptian vase. The process of using lichens in embalming is a fascinating discovery. For starters, to embalm a body, a slit was made in the abdomen and the organs and viscera were removed. The organs and viscera were wrapped in separate linen packets and replaced in the body or put in canopic jars between the legs. The body cavity was then packed with lichen, sawdust, bruised myrrh, cassia, and every other spices. Pseudevernia furfuracea was employed due to its preservative and aromatic qualities. Also it was used simply as a highly absorbent, light-weight packaging material. It also contains antibiotic substances. These qualities helped inhibit bacterial decay of the mummies. Another discovery is that the Egyptians would grind and mix Pseudevernia furfuracea with their flour for bread. The bread was then placed with the mummy and thought to be the first meal for the mummy in its afterlife. Pseudevernia furfuracea was imported shiploads from the Grecian archipelago to Alexandria. Whether Pseudevernia furfuracea, was used for embalming, medicinal purposes, or as an ingredient in bread, it has its place in history as an important plant connecting a culture to its environment. Today, embalming fluids are colored from the lichen dye orchil into a product called Cudbear, illustrating how a historical procedure can influence future practices.\\n\\nLichens have been and are still being used for many other purposes, including\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ettington railway station", "body": "Ettington railway station was a railway station located one mile to the north of Ettington, Warwickshire, England.\\n\\nOpened on 1 July 1873 the station was situated on the East and West Junction Railway route from Stratford-upon-Avon to Fenny Compton.\\n\\nThe station had two platforms with a passing loop for the otherwise single line. Its buildings were of brick and to a design virtually standard for the line. There was a small waiting shelter on the down platform, access to which was by a barrow crossing. There were three sidings including one each to the goods shed and cattle pens. \\n\\nFour years after opening the station had its passenger service withdrawn due to lack of business. An extension to Broom Junction was incorporated in 1873 by means of a railway called the Evesham Redditch and Stratford-upon-Avon Junction Railway which opened in 1879. As trade picked up, the station was reopened on 22 February 1885. \\n\\nThe line became part of the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway in a merger of 1908 and at grouping in 1923 it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.\\n\\nThe LMS found it a useful link between its Bristol and London routes in competition with GWR goods traffic to the Capital. \\n\\nIn common with normal single line working, tokens would be exchanged at the signal boxes associated with each station loop.

Hanley took over as President of Local 257 of the New York City District Council of Carpenters for his father-in-law, a Genovese mobster named Will Graziano. Hanley and Local Vice-President Attilio Bitondo extorted building contractors operating in Manhattan in conjunction with Local shop steward Carmine Fiore, a Gambino crime family soldier, and other organized crime figures linked to the Gambino, Genovese and Colombo crime families. The men ordered beatings for those contractors who refused to back in, but typically, violence wasn't needed.\\n\\nIn 1987, Hanley, Bitondo and other high ranking officials of the N.Y.C. District Council of Carpenters were indicted on 79 counts of labor racketeering, including extortion, bribery, and bid rigging. District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau claimed that contractors that cooperated with the DA's investigation claimed they paid over $100,000 in extortion payments, but DA Morgenthau explained that the figure documented less than 10% of the money paid to the gangsters during the investigation. Gambino associate turned informant Dominick LoFaro wore a wire to gather information on the unions and gangsters, and provided information to the New York State Organized Crime Task Force leading to the \"bugging\" of the offices of Local 608 at 1650 Broadway and of Local 257 at 157 East 25th Street. LoFaro also discussed Hanley's ties to other organized crime figures, including Bartholomew \"Bobby\" Boriello, Albert \"Kid Blast\" Gallo, Anthony \"Tony\" Scotto and Anthony \"Sonny\" Ciccone. Hanley would receive a 4-year prison sentence to lesser charges of bribe giving, and would be banned from future union activities. Hanley earned an early release from prison and received a no-show work release job at Casale Jewelry on Court Street, Brooklyn. Hanley's son William was dismissed from his position as President of Carpenter's Union Local 157 (which was re-named after the massive racketeering indictment) in November 2007, and the Local was placed under trusteeship, citing connections to organized crime, including prevailing upon a contractor to hire a no-work man named Joseph Vecchiarello.\\n\\n"}

They include a variety of common free-living species, as well as a few important parasites, some of which infect humans. There are two main subgroups, the euglenid and kinetoplastid. Euglenozoa are unicellular, mostly around 15-40 µm in size, although some euglenids get up to 500 µm long.\\n\\nMost euglenozoa have two flagella, which are inserted parallel to one another in an apical or subapical pocket. In some these are associated with a cytostome or mouth, used to ingest bacteria or other small organisms. This is supported by one of three sets of microtubule that arise from the flagellar bases; the other two support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell.\\n\\nSome other euglenozoa feed through the absorption, and many euglenids possess chloroplast and so obtain energy through photosynthesis. These chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain chlorophyll A and C, along with other pigments, so are probably derived from a captured green alga. Reproduction occurs exclusively through cell division. During mitosis, the nuclear membrane remains intact, and the spindle microtubules form inside of it.\\n\\nThe group is characterized by the ultrastructure of the flagella. In addition to the normal supporting microtubules or axoneme, each contains a rod (called paraxonemal), which has a tubular structure in one flagellum and a latticed structure in the other. Based on this, two smaller groups have been included here: the diplonemid and Postgaardi.\\n\\nThe euglenozoa are generally accepted as monophyletic. They are related to Percolozoa; the two share mitochondria with disk-shaped cristae, which only occurs in a few other groups. Both probably belong to a larger group of eukaryotes called the excavate. This grouping, though, has been challenged.\\n\\n*\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Euler–Liljestrand mechanism", "body": "The Euler–Liljestrand mechanism describes the connection between ventilation and blood circulation (perfusion) of the lung. If the ventilation in a part of the lung decreases, this leads to local hypoxia and to vasoconstriction in that part. This adaptive mechanism is beneficial, because it diminishes the amount of blood that passes the lung without being oxygenated. The mechanism was discovered by two Swedish pharmacologist, Ulf von Euler and Göran Liljestrand at the Department of Pharmacology of Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.\\n\\nThe molecular mechanism seems to be mediated by oxygen-sensitive potassium ion channel in the cell membrane of pulmonary smooth muscle. With a low partial pressure of oxygen, these channels are blocked, leading to the depolarization of the cell membrane. Calcium channels are activated and cause the influx of Ca ions over the membrane and to the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. The rise of calcium concentration causes contraction of the blood vessels smooth muscle fibers and the resulting vasoconstriction. Histamine has also been implicated in this mechanism.\\n\\n"}

For both architectural and cultural reasons, the hotel is one of the most important buildings on the far North Coast of California.\\n\\nIn late September 2008 (after the inn had been closed more than four years), the Eureka Times Standard reported that Libo Zhu purchased the Inn for $2.75 million. His business plan, reviewed by the Greater Eureka Chamber of Commerce, suggested that he has \"ambitious\" plans to honor the inn's \"integrity as a historic hotel.\"\\n\\nAfter being shuttered for nearly 6 years, the Inn reopened in May 2010. The soft grand opening included making approximately half the rooms available, with a promise from the new owner that constant improvement will continue toward 5 star status full service, including restaurants, bars, and conference rooms. Stated plans include completing the year with a Christmas tree and holiday events reminiscent of past decor and programming.\\n\\nArchitectural details contributing to the richness of this imposing Tudorbethan structure include the use of differing roof forms and \"visually stunning textured elevations\", which are highlighted by stucco and half-timbering (see photo below).left\\n\\nThe  hotel, which fully occupies a city block, has had up to 104 guest rooms, including 99 rooms and five full suites. The hotel has historically contained up to three restaurants, two bars, two saunas, an indoor spa, and nine meeting venues, all of which has been supported by up to 140 employees. Resplendent with its courtyard (now primarily a swimming pool), grand entry, great lounge and giant fireplace, and constructed of Redwood, it is the largest conference facility and third largest lodging property in the region.\\n\\nThe building, a National Register of Historic Places property, remained closed for several years, awaiting an owner who could return it to its rightful place as the cultural hub of the Greater Eureka Area. Though the exterior was refurbished in 2005, including a return to its crisp 1920's color scheme of white with green highlighting and trim, the interior rooms and public areas needed updating and remodeling to be made again ready for the public.\\n\\nThe hotel opening and dedication in 1922 coincided with the opening of the Redwood Highway between Eureka and San Francisco. A large property for those times, the Eureka Inn was the premier full service lodging between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon. Though it housed many thousands of visitors (including US Presidents and royalty) from all over the world during its first several decades, the hotel began to show the effects of time. In 1960 Helen Barnum, the matriarch of a successful timber family in the county, purchased controlling interest in the hotel and a process of modernization began.\\n\\nStarting with the holiday seasons after a significant management change in 1976 under the direction of Barnum's manager, John Porter, the hotel became known for daily cultural offerings against the backdrop of extensive decorations representing each year's carefully chosen Holiday theme. Related events were typically centered on a large, extravagantly decorated Christmas tree in the old world style great lounge and main lobby. The front entry portico (usually graced by the presence of a black Cadillac stretch limousine) situated on elevated landscaping made this hotel the chosen spot for parade watchers and official review stands through the years. Countless meetings, conferences, receptions, performances, and various small and large family events have occurred in this, a favorite of Humboldt County residents and visitors alike.\\n\\nThe 2004 foreclosure, closure, and subsequent auction led to a palpable void in the community, which easily recalled the Inn as the place to be in Eureka and Humboldt County. Now, the Inn begins its renewed life in the community as appropriate upgrades and improvements combine with original decor and extensive use of redwood timbering, all of which represents a modern appreciation for a storied past, when timber was king. Over 87 years ago local businesses sought to build an Inn to provide a high level of hospitality and service for visitors and locals alike and now its on its way back.\\n\\nEureka Inn Official Website\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Europa-Institut of Saarland University", "body": "The Europa-Institut was founded at Saarland University in 1951, long before the signing of the Treaties of Rome, and it is consequently the second eldest program of its kind in Europe. Over 5,000 students from over 40 different countries have since graduated from the Institute. Having built on the content of its study program continuously and adapted to developments on the European level over time, the Europa-Institut today focuses on European law and international law with the possibility of specialization in specific study units.\\n\\nThe history of the Europa-Institut flaunts remarkable continuity. The Europa-Institut was intended to be the \"jewel and symbol\" of Saarland University, a university itself based on the merger of German and French educational traditions, founded under the aegis of France and the University of Nancy in 1948 and boasting personalities such as Robert Schumann amongst the first of its students. \\n\\nProfessor Angelloz (the first director of the Institute and second vice chancellor of the University) stated the following the Europa-Institut’s task and aim: \"to research the Europe of the future, to teach young people educated in the traditional manner of each different country about Europe, to offer education from a uniform European perspective for students from these countries and, perhaps before long, to produce Europe’s driving forces.\" \\n\\nThe Europa-Institut dedicated itself to following the European integration process from the very beginning, providing a curriculum independent of that of Saarland University and taught by personalities such as the French politician, academic and pioneer of the European movement, André Philip.\\n\\nTo start with, almost all \"European disciplines\" were included in the study program. The focus during the first two years, namely 1951 and 1952, was on comparative literature, philosophy, history and musicology. Law and economics were disciplines which played a complimentary role. \\n\\nThe gradual integration of the European Community influenced the development of the curriculum so that the program began to reflect formation of the Community’s legal, economical and political character. As such, the former program description of the Europa-Institut stated that, \"The moment at which Europe, driven by its historical development, becomes conscious of its unity and the reality surrounding it and where consequently new political, legal, economic and cultural organs are formed and unfold,\" would mark the point at which it was imperative to offer a corresponding, uniform European education.\\n\\nThe importance of the Institute also grew with the development of project Europe. In 1953 a structural change led to the establishment of a diplomacy department within the Institute. The purpose of this department was to train students wishing to pursue a career in diplomacy or in the civil service of the, at that time, semi-autonomous Saarland region. In the meantime, the law, culture, economics and independent language department established themselves further.\\n\\nWhen Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957, Saarland University adopted the German university system. The Europa-Institut, which up to that point was geared primarily towards cultural and literary studies, was transformed into a European research institute with law and economics as the focal point. The Europa-Institut began operating with this concept in the winter term of 1957/58.\\n\\nIn the mid sixties, the study program was combined so as to constitute a single integrated course. The emphasis lay on the specific problems pertaining to the European integrational process and the related instruments and methods. Law-based courses formed the core of program and these were complemented by courses in history, politics and economics.\\n\\nThe postgraduate program \"European Integration\" was established in 1980 by the law department of the Institute, with Prof. Dr. H. C. Mult. Georg Ress and Prof. Dr. Michael R. Will as the first to head it. In 1991, Prof. Dr. Torsten Stein from Heidelberg and Prof. Dr. Werner Meng from Halle were appointed directors of the Institute.\\n\\nThe Master's program \"European Integration\" is a 12-month, full-time LL.M course centering on substantive, institutional and procedural European law and international law. The possible areas of specialization are European Economic Law, Foreign Trade, European Media Law, European Protection of Human Rights and European Private Law.\\n\\nThe Master's degree qualifies as a model program for European studies. It was officially approved, and is supported by, the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Ministry of Education, Science Research and Technology, the European Commission and the \"Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft.\"\\n\\nThe alumni association EVER was established by current and former students of the Europa-Institut, Law Department, of Saarland University, in 1996. By means of numerous activities, the alumni association aims to: \\n\\nIn addition, EVER unites students and alumni of different nationalities across professional and geographic borders and thus constitutes, alongside the study program itself, a contact forum that contributes to international understanding worldwide.\\n\\nSince 1972, the Europa-Institut holds one of 52 European Documentation and Information Center (EDC) in Germany and forms part of a network of 600 EDZs worldwide. The goal of the EDCs is to make available to the public (both in and outside the university system) information on the European Union and its policies and to support the research and teaching of the European integrational process. \\n\\nAll publicly available official publications of the EU (Official Gazette of the EU, documents of the Commission, case law of the European Court of Justice), as well as periodicals, brochure and information material are collected in the EDC. Access to numerous databases of the EU as well as to an increasing amount of electronic documentation is also provided\\n\\nThe Europa-Institut has been publishing its own academic journal, ZEuS (\"Zeitschrift für europarechtliche Studien\") since 1998. It appears on a quarterly basis and is dedicated to topical problems relating to European integration, European and international law, as well as international aspects of constitutional law. It focuses particularly on European media law and on the European protection of human rights, as well as on European and international economic law. Since ZEuS contains not only German, but also English, French and Spanish contributions, it constitutes an ideal forum both for academia and practice.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "European Currency Unit", "body": "The European Currency Unit (₠ or ECU: ,  or spelt out ) was a basket of the currencies of the European Community member states, used as the unit of account of the European Community before being replaced by the euro on January 1, 1999, at parity. The ECU itself replaced the European Unit of Account, also at parity, on March 13, 1979. The European Exchange Rate Mechanism attempted to minimize fluctuations between member state currencies and the ECU. The ECU was also used in some international financial transactions, where its advantage was that securities denominated in ECUs provided investors with the opportunity for foreign diversification without reliance on the currency of a single country.\\n\\nThe ECU was conceived on 13 March 1979 as an internal accounting unit. It had the ISO 4217 currency code XEU.\\n\\nOn 1 January 1999, the euro (with the code EUR and symbol €) replaced the ECU, at the value €1 = 1 ECU. Unlike the ECU, the euro is a real currency, although not all member states participate (for details on Euro membership see Eurozone). Two of the countries in the ECU basket of currencies, UK and Denmark, did not join the eurozone, and a third, Greece, joined late. On the other hand, Finland and Austria joined the Eurozone from the beginning although their currencies were not part of the ECU basket (since they had joined the EU in 1995, two years after the ECU composition was \"frozen\").\\n\\nDue to the ECU being used in some international financial transactions, there was a concern that foreign courts might not recognize the euro as the legal successor to the ECU. This was unlikely to be a problem, since it is a generally accepted principle of private international law that states determine their currencies, and that therefore states would accept the European Union legislation to that effect. However, for abundant caution, several foreign jurisdictions adopted legislation to ensure a smooth transition. Of particular importance here were the USA states of Illinois and New York, under whose laws a large proportion of international financial contracts are made. Both these states passed legislation to ensure that the euro was recognized as successor to the ECU.\\n\\nAlthough the acronym ECU is formed from English words, écu is also the name of an ancient French coin. That was one (perhaps the main) reason that a new name was devised for its successor currency, euro, which was felt not to favour any single language.\\n\\nThe currency's symbol, ₠ (U+20A0), comprises an interlaced C and E, which are the initial letters of the phrase 'European Community' in many European languages. However, this symbol was not widely used: few systems at the time could render it and in any case banks preferred (as with all currencies) to use the ISO code XEU.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "European Patent Convention", "body": "thumbThe Convention on the Grant of European Patents of 5 October 1973, commonly known as the European Patent Convention (EPC), is a multilateral treaty instituting the European Patent Organisation and providing an autonomous legal system according to which European patents are granted. The term European patent is used to refer to patent granted under the European Patent Convention. However, after grant a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents, subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited opposition procedure, which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and limitation and revocation procedures, which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.\\n\\nThe EPC provides a legal framework for the granting of European patents, via a single, harmonized procedure before the European Patent Office. A single patent application, in one language, may be filed at the European Patent Office at Munich, at its branches at The Hague or Berlin or at a national patent office of a Contracting State, if the national law of the State so permits.\\n\\nThere is currently no single, centrally enforceable, European Union-wide patent. Since the 1970s, there has been concurrent discussion towards the creation of a Community patent in the European Union. In May 2004 however, this has led to a stalemate.\\n\\nBefore 1978, two important problems when seeking to obtain patent protection in Europe in a number of countries were first the need to file a separate patent application in each country, with a subsequent distinct grant procedure in each country, and secondly the need to translate the text of the application into a number of different languages. Different languages are indeed utilised across the European countries and there is substantial expense in preparing translations into each of those languages. While the European Patent Convention does not totally overcome the need for translations (since a translation may be required after grant to validate a patent in a given EPC Contracting State), it does centralise the prosecution in one language and defers the cost of translations until the time of grant.\\n\\nIn September 1949, French Senator Henri Longchambon proposed to the Council of Europe the creation of a European Patent Office. His plan was however not found to be practicable by the Council's Committee of Experts in patent matters. The meetings of the Committee nevertheless led to two Conventions, one on the formalities required for patent applications (1953) and one on the international classification of patent (1954). The Council's Committee then carried on its work on substantive patent law, resulting in the signature of the Strasbourg Patent Convention in 1963.\\n\\nIn 1973, the Munich Diplomatic Conference for the setting up of a European System for the Grant of Patents took place and the Convention was then signed in Munich (the Convention is sometimes known as the Munich Convention). The signature of the Convention was the accomplishment of a decade-long discussion during which Kurt Haertel, considered by many as the father of the European Patent Organisation, and François Savignon played a decisive role.\\n\\nThe Convention entered into force on 7 October 1977 for the following first countries: Belgium, Germany (then West Germany), France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland and United Kingdom, and on 1 May 1978 for Sweden. However, the first patent applications were filed on 1 June 1978 (date fixed by the Administrative Council which held its first meeting on 19 October 1977). Subsequently, other countries have joined the EPC.\\n\\nThe EPC is separate from the European Union (EU), and its membership is different; Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Turkey, Monaco, Iceland, Norway, Croatia, the Republic of Macedonia, San Marino, Albania and Serbia are members of the EPO but are not members of the EU. The Convention is, as of October 2010, in force in 38 countries. Serbia became the 38th state on 1 October 2010.\\n\\nIn addition to the Contracting States, States may also conclude a cooperation agreement with the EPO, known as an extension agreement. The state then becomes \"extension state\", which means European patents granted by the EPO may be extended to those countries by the payment of additional fees and completion of certain formalities. As of October 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro have extension agreements with the EPO so that, in effect, these states can be designated in a European patent application.\\n\\nA diplomatic conference was held in November 2000 in Munich to revise the Convention, amongst other things to integrate in the EPC new developments in international law and to add a level of judicial review of the Boards of Appeal decisions. The revised text, informally called the EPC 2000, entered into force on 13 December 2007.\\n\\nThe content of the Convention includes several texts in addition to the main 178 articles. These additional texts, which are integral parts of the Convention, are\\n\\nOne of the most important articles of the Convention, , entitled \"Patentable invention\", states:\\n\\nThis article constitutes the \"fundamental provision of the EPC which governs the patentability of inventions\".\\n\\nHowever, the EPC provides further indications on what is patentable. There are exclusions under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC and exclusions under Article 53 EPC.\\n\\nFirst, discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, aesthetic creations, schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, programs for computers  and presentations of information  are not regarded as inventions  and are excluded from patentability only to the extent that the invention relates to those areas as such. This is \"a negative, non-exhaustive list of what should not be regarded as an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC.\" (For further information, see also: Software patents under the EPC).\\n\\nThe second set of exclusions, or exceptions, include\\n\\nThe Convention also includes provisions setting out filing requirements of European applications, the procedure up to grant, the opposition procedure and other aspects relating to the prosecution of patent applications under the Convention.\\n\\nEuropean patent applications may be filed in any official language of an EPC contracting state (subject to certain requirements),  but patent applications are prosecuted in the three official languages of the EPO - English, French and German (if an application is filed in a language other than the official languages, a translation must be filed into one of the three. The filing fee is reduced to offset the additional cost of the translation). The official language of filing (or of the translation) is adopted as the \"language of proceedings\" and is used by the EPO for communications.\\n\\nEuropean patent applications are prosecuted in a similar fashion to most patent systems - the invention is searched and published, and subsequently examined for compliance with the requirements of the EPC.\\n\\nDuring the prosecution phase, a European patent is a single regional proceeding, and \"the grant of a European patent may be requested for one or more of the Contracting States.\" An applicant for a European patent designates those Contracting States in which protection for the invention is desired,  and the designations need to be \"confirmed\" later during the procedure through the payment of designation fees. Once granted by the EPO, a European patent comes into existence effectively as a group of national patents in each of the designated Contracting States.\\n\\nThere are only two types of centrally executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the limitation and revocation procedures. The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent. It is a quasi-judicial process, subject to appeal, which can lead to maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute). National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.\\n\\nIn contrast to the unified, regional character of a European patent application, the granted European patent does not comprise, in effect, any such unitary character, except for the opposition procedure. In other words, one European patent in one Contracting State is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition procedure.\\n\\nA European patent confers rights on its proprietor, in each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted, from the date of publication of the mention of its grant in the European Patent Bulletin. That is also the date of publication of the B1 document, i.e. the European patent specification. This means that the European patent is granted and confers rights in all its designated Contracting States at the date of mention of the grant, whether or not a prescribed translation is filed with a national patent office later on (though the right may later be deemed never to have existed in any particular State if a translation is not subsequently filed in time, as described below).\\n\\nA translation of a granted European patent must be filed in some EPC Contracting States to avoid loss of right. Namely, in the Contracting States which have \"prescribe[d] that if the text, in which the European Patent Office intends to grant a European patent (...) is not drawn up in one of its official languages, the applicant for or proprietor of the patent shall supply to its central industrial property office a translation of this text in one of its official languages at his option or, where that State has prescribed the use of one specific official language, in that language\". The European patent is void ab initio in a designated Contracting State where the required translation (if required) is not filed within the prescribed time limit after grant. In other Contracting States, no translation needs to be filed, for example in Ireland if the European patent is in English. In those Contracting States where the London Agreement is in force the requirement to file a translation of the European patent has been entirely or partially waived. If a translation is required, a fee covering the publication of said translation may be due as well.\\n\\nAlmost all attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, except for the opposition procedure, limitation procedure, and revocation procedure as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions. Thus, almost all post-grant proceedings - including renewal, revocation,  and infringement enforcement are determined under national law.\\n\\nInfringement is remitted almost entirely to national law and to national courts. In one of its very few substantive interventions into national law, the EPC requires that national courts must consider the \"direct product of a patented process\" to be an infringement. The \"extent of the protection\" conferred by a European patent is determined primarily by reference to the claims of the European patent (rather than by the disclosure of the specification and drawing, as in some older patent systems), though the description and drawings are to be used as interpretive aids in determining the meaning of the claims. A \"Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC\" provides further guidance, that claims are to be construed using a \"fair\" middle position, neither \"strict, literal\" nor as mere guidelines to considering the description and drawings, though of course even the protocol is subject to national interpretation. The authentic text of a European patent application and of a European patent are the documents in the language of the proceedings.\\n\\nAll other substantive rights attached to a European patent in a Contracting State, such as what acts constitute infringement (indirect and divided infringement, infringement by equivalents, extraterritorial infringement, infringement outside the term of the patent with economic effect during the term of the patent, infringement of product claims by processes for making or using, exports, assembly of parts into an infringing whole, etc.), the effect of prosecution history on interpretation of the claims, remedies for infringement or bad faith enforcement (injunction, damages, attorney fees, other civil penalties for willful infringement, etc.), equitable defenses, coexistence of an EP national daughter and a national patent for identical subject matter, ownership and assignment, extensions to patent term for regulatory approval, etc., are expressly remitted to national law.\\n\\nFor a period in the late-1990's, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all EP jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the European Court of Justice. In two cases in July 2006 interpreting Articles 6.1 and 16.4 of the Brussels Convention, the European Court of Justice held that European patents are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was \"unavoidable\" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.\\n\\nValidity is also remitted largely to national law and national courts.  limits the application of national law to only the following grounds of invalidity, and specifies that the standards for each ground are those of national law:\\n\\nA national court may partially invalidate a European patent in a Contracting State, e.g., by revoking only some claims, or by permitting amendment to the claims, the description or the drawings, as allowed by national law.\\n\\nA European patent is also non-unitary in that it may be revoked in one Contracting State while maintained in another. However, a national court in one Contracting State may not revoke a European patent in another Contracting State.\\n\\nEPO Boards of Appeal decisions are not precedential at all upon national courts, which have exclusive jurisdiction on validity and infringement after a European patent has been granted (except during the 9 month opposition period, which can only relate to validity). However, national courts will tend to take note, and may find 'persuasive', decisions of the EPO Boards, though they can disagree with them.\\n\\nThe EPC requires all jurisdictions to give a European patent a term of 20 years from the filing date, the filing date being the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the date of filing of an international application under the PCT designating the EPO. The filing date is not necessarily the priority date, which can be up to one year earlier. The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval. For EEA member states this is by means of a supplementary protection certificate.\\n\\nA European patent application may result from the filing of an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and the entry into \"European regional phase\". The European patent application is therefore said to be a \"Euro-PCT application\" and the EPO is said to act as a designated or elected Office.\\n\\nEleven EPC Contracting States, namely Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands and Slovenia have \"closed their national route\". This means that it is no longer possible to obtain a national patent protection through the international (PCT) phase without entering into the regional European phase and obtaining a European patent.\\n\\nSee List of patent legal concepts for articles on various legal aspects of patents, including special types of patents and patent applications.\\n\\nSee also \"European Patent Organisation\" box below.\\n\\n"}

After receiving his early education in his native town, he studied theology at Caesarea and Antioch and philosophy and science at Alexandria.

{"title": "Evans & Sutherland ES-1", "body": "The ES-1 was Evans &amp; Sutherland's abortive attempt to enter the supercomputer market. About to be released just as the market was drying up in the post-cold war military wind-down, only a handful were built and only two sold.\\n\\nJean-Yves Leclerc was a computer designer who was unable to find funding in Europe for a high-performance server design. In 1985 he visited Dave Evans, his former PhD. adviser, looking for advice. After some discussion he eventually convinced him that since most of their customers were running E&S graphics hardware on Cray Research machines and other supercomputers, it would make sense if E&S could offer their own low-cost platform instead. Eventually a new Evans &amp; Sutherland Computer Division, or ESCD, was set up in 1986 to work on the design. Unlike the rest of E&S's operations which are headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, it was felt that the computer design would need to be in the \"heart of things\" in Silicon Valley, and the new division was set up in Mountain View, California.\\n\\nThe basic idea of Leclerc's system was to use an 8x8 crossbar to connect eight custom CMOS CPU together at high speed. An extra channel on the crossbar allowed it to be connected to another crossbar, forming a single 16-processor unit. The units were 16-sized (instead of 8) in order to fully utilize a 16-bank high-speed memory that had been designed along with the rest of the system. Since memory was logically organized on the \"far side\" of the crossbars, the memory controller handled many of the tasks that would normally be left to the processors, including interrupt handling and virtual memory translation, avoiding a trip through the crossbar for these \"housekeeping\" tasks.\\n\\nThe resulting 16-unit processor/memory blocks could then be connected together using another 8x8 crossbar, creating a 128-processor machine. Although the delays between the 16-unit blocks would be high, if the task could be cleanly separated into units the delay would not have a huge effect on performance. When data did have to be shared across the banks the system balanced the requests; first the \"leftmost\" processor in the queue would get access, then the \"rightmost\". Processors added their requests onto the proper end of the queue based on their physical location in the machine. It was felt that the simplicity and speed of this algorithm would make up for the potential gains of a more complex load-balancing system.\\n\\nIn order to allow the system to work even with the high inter-unit latencies, each processor used an 8-deep instruction pipeline. Branches used a variable delay slot, the end of which was signaled by a bit in the next instruction. The bit indicated that the results of the branch had to be re-merged at this point, stalling the processor until this took place. Each processor also included a floating point unit from Weitek. For marketing purposes, each processor was called a \"computational unit\", and a card-cage populated with 16 was referred to as a \"processor\". This allowed favorable per-\"processor\" performance comparisons with other supercomputers of the era.\\n\\nThe processors ran at 20 MHz in the integer units and 40 MHz for the FPUs, with the intention being to increase this to 50 MHz by the time it shipped. At about 12 Mflops peak per CU, the machine as a whole would deliver up to 1.5 GFLOPS, although due to the memory latencies this was typically closer to 250 MFLOPS. While this was fast for a CMOS machine processor of the time, it was hardly competitive for a supercomputer. Nevertheless the machine was air cooled, and would have been the fastest such machine on the market.\\n\\nThe machine ran an early version of the Mach kernel for multi-processor support. The compilers were designed to keep the processors as full as possible by reducing the number of branch delay slots, and did a particularly good job of it. \\n\\nUnfortunately the new leftmost-rightmost algorithm had a fatal flaw. In high-contention cases the \"middle\" units would never be serviced, and could stall for thousands of cycles. By 1989 it was clear this was going to need a redesign, but by this point other machines with similar price/performance ratio were coming on the market and the pressure was on to ship immediately. The first two machines were shipped to Caltech and the University of Colorado at Boulder in November 1989, but there were no other immediate sales. One sample ES-1 is in storage at the Computer History Museum.\\n\\nEvans resigned from the E&S board in 1989, and suddenly the votes turned against continuing the project. E&S looked for a buyer who was interested in continuing the effort, but finding none they instead closed the division in January 1990.\\n\\nRobert Schreiber and Horst D.

The most common evaporative-pattern material used is polystyrene foam.\\n\\nThe two major evaporative-pattern casting processes are:\\n\\nThe main difference is that lost-foam casting uses an unbonded sand and full-mold casting uses a bonded sand (or green sand). Because this difference is quite small there is much overlap in the terminology. Non-proprietary terms that have been used to describe these processes include: cavityless casting, evaporative foam casting, foam vaporization casting, lost pattern casting, the castral process, and expanded polystyrene molding. Proprietary terms included Styro-cast, Foam Cast, Replicast, and Policast.\\n\\nThe first patent for an evaporative-pattern casting process was filed in April 1956, by H.F. Shroyer. He patented the use of foam patterns embedded in traditional green sand for metal casting. In his patent, a pattern was machined from a block of expanded polystyrene (EPS), and supported by bonded sand during pouring. This process is now known as the full mold process. \\n\\nIn 1964, M.C. Flemmings used unbonded sand for the process. The first North American foundry to use evaporative-pattern casting was the Robinson Foundry at Alexander City, Alabama. General motors first product using these processes was the 4.3L, V-6 diesel cylinder head, which were made in 1981 at Massena, New York.\\n\\nA study found in 1997 that evaporative-pattern casting processes accounted for approximately 140,000 tons of aluminium casting in the United States. The same survey forecast that evaporative-pattern casting processes would account for 29% of the aluminium, and 14% of the ferrous casting markets by 2010.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Event calculus", "body": "The event calculus is a logic language for representing and reasoning about actions and their effects first presented by Robert Kowalski and Marek Sergot in 1986.It was extended by Murray Shanahan and Rob Miller in the 1990s.The basic components of the event calculus, as with other similar languages for reasoning about actions and change are fluent and action. In the event calculus, one can specify the value of fluents at some given time points, the actions that took place at given time points, and the effects of actions.\\n\\nIn the event calculus, fluents are reified. This means that statements are not formalized as predicate but as function. A separate predicate  is used to tell which fluents hold at a given time point. For example,  means that the box is on the table at time ; in this formula,  is a predicate while  is a function.\\n\\nActions are also represented as terms. The effects of actions are given using the predicates  and . In particular,  means that,if the action represented by the term  is executed at time ,then the fluent  will be true after .The  predicate has a similar meaning, with the only difference being that  will be false and not true after .\\n\\nLike other languages for representing actions, the event calculus formalizes the correct evolution of the fluent via formulae telling the value of each fluent after an arbitrary action has been performed. The event calculus solves the frame problem in a way that is similar to the successor state axiom of the situation calculus: a fluent is true at time  if and only if it has been made true in the past and has not been made false in the meantime.\\n\\nThis formula means that the fluent represented by the term  is true at time  if:\\n\\nA similar formula is used to formalize the opposite case in which a fluent is false at a given time. Other formulae are also needed for correctly formalizing fluents before they have been effects of an action. These formulae are similar to the above, but  is replaced by .\\n\\nThe  predicate, stating that a fluent has been made false during an interval, can be axiomatized, or simply taken as a shorthand, as follows:\\n\\nThe axioms above relate the value of the predicates ,  and , but do not specify which fluents are known to be true and which actions actually make fluents true or false. This is done by using a set of domain-dependent axioms. The known values of fluents are stated as simple literals . The effects of actions are stated by formulae relating the effects of actions with their preconditions. For example, if the action  makes the fluent  true, but only if  is currently true, the corresponding formula in the event calculus is:\\n\\nThe right-hand expression of this equivalence is composed of a disjunction: for each action and fluent that can be made true by the action, there is a disjunct saying that  is actually that action, that  is actually that fluent, and that the precondition of the action is met.\\n\\nThe formula above specifies the truth value of  for every possible action and fluent. As a result, all effects of all actions have to be combined in a single formulae. This is a problem, because the addition of a new action requires modifying an existing formula rather than adding new ones. This problem can be solved by the application of circumscription to a set of formulae each specifying one effect of one action:\\n\\nThese formulae are simpler than the formula above, because each effect of each action can be specified separately. The single formula telling which actions  and fluents  make  true has been replaced by a set of smaller formulae, each one telling the effect of an action to a fluent.\\n\\nHowever, these formulae are not equivalent to the formula above. Indeed, they only specify sufficient conditions for  to be true, which should be completed by the fact that  is false in all other cases. This fact can be formalized by simply circumscribing the predicate  in the formula above. It is important to note that this circumscription is done only on the formulae specifying  and not on the domain-independent axioms. The predicate  can be specified in the same way  is.\\n\\nA similar approach can be taken for the  predicate. The evaluation of this predicate can be enforced by formulae specifying not only when it is true and when it is false:\\n\\nCircumscription can simplify this specification, as only necessary conditions can be specified:\\n\\nCircumscribing the predicate , this predicate will be false in all points in which it is not explicitly specified to be true. This circumscription has to be done separately from the circumscription of the other formulae. In other words, if  is the set of formulae of the kind ,  is the set of formulae , and  are the domain independent axioms, the correct formulation of the domain is:\\n\\nThe event calculus was originally formulated as a set of Horn clauses augmented with negation as failure and could be run as a Prolog program. In fact, circumscription is one of the several semantics that can be given to negation as failure, and is closely related to the completion semantics (in which \"if\" is interpreted as \"if and only if\" -- see logic programming).\\n\\nThe original event calculus paper of Kowalski and Sergot focused on applications to database updates and narratives. Extensions of the event calculus can also formalize non-deterministic actions, concurrent actions, actions with delayed effects, gradual changes, actions with duration, continuous change, and non-inertial fluents.\\n\\nKave Eshghi showed how the event calculus can be used for planning, using abduction to generate hypothetical events in abductive logic programming. Van Lambalgen and Hamm showed how the event calculus can also be used to give an algorithmic semantics to tense and aspect in natural language using constraint logic programming.\\n\\nIn addition to Prolog and its variants, several other tools for reasoning using the event calculus are also available:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Evidentiality", "body": "In linguistics, evidentiality is, broadly, the indication of the nature of evidence for a given statement, that is, whether evidence exists for the statement and/or what kind of evidence exists. An evidential (also verificational or validational) is the particular grammatical element (affix, clitic, or particle) that indicates evidentiality. Languages with only a single evidential have had terms such as mediative, médiatif, médiaphorique, and indirective used instead of evidential.\\n\\nAll languages have some means of specifying the source of information. European languages (such as Germanic and Romance languages) often indicate evidential-type information through modal verb (, , , ) or other lexical words (adverbial) () or phrases (English: it seems to me). \\n\\nSome languages have a distinct grammatical category of evidentiality that is required to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, it seems to me that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.\\n\\nAlexandra Aikhenvald (2004) reports that about a quarter of the world's languages have some type of grammatical evidentiality. She also reports that, to her knowledge, no research has been conducted on grammatical evidentiality in sign language. A first preliminary study on evidentiality in sign language has been conducted by Laura Mazzoni on LIS (Italian Sign Language).\\n\\nMany languages with grammatical evidentiality mark evidentiality independently from tense-aspect or epistemic modality (which is the speaker's evaluation of the information, i.e. whether it is reliable, uncertain, probable). \\n\\nGrammatical evidentiality may be expressed in different forms (depending on the language), such as through affix, clitic, or particle. For example, Eastern Pomo has 4 evidential suffixes that are added to verbs, -ink’e (nonvisual sensory), -ine (inferential), -·le (hearsay), -ya (direct knowledge).\\n\\nThe use of evidentiality has pragmatic implications in languages that do not mark evidentiality distinctly from epistemic modality. For example, a person who makes a false statement qualified as a belief may be considered mistaken; a person who makes a false statement qualified as a personally observed fact will probably be considered to have lied.\\n\\nFollowing the typology of Aikhenvald (2004, 2006), there are two broad types of evidential marking:\\n\\nThe first type (indirectivity) indicates whether evidence exists for a given statement, but does not specify what kind of evidence. The second type (evidentiality proper) specifies the kind of evidence (such as whether the evidence is visual, reported, or inferred).\\n\\nIndirectivity (also known as inferentiality) systems are common in Iranian, Finno-Ugric, and Turkic languages. These languages indicate whether evidence exists for a given source of information — thus, they contrast direct information (reported directly) and indirect information (reported indirectly, focusing on its reception by the speaker/recipient). Unlike the other evidential \"type II\" systems, indirectivity marking does not indicate information about the source of knowledge: it is irrelevant whether the information results from hearsay, inference, or perception (however, some Turkic languages distinguish between reported indirect and non-reported indirect, see Johanson 2003, 2000 for further elaboration). This can be seen in the following Turkish verbs:\\n\\nIn the first word geldi, the unmarked suffix -di indicates past tense. In the second word gelmiş, the suffix -miş also indicates past tense but indirectly. It may be translated into English with the added words obviously or as far as I understand. The direct past tense marker -di is unmarked (or neutral) in the sense that whether or not evidence exists supporting the statement is not specified.\\n\\nThe other broad type of evidentiality systems (\"type II\") specifies the nature of the evidence supporting a statement. These kinds of evidence can be divided into such criteria as:\\n\\nA witness evidential indicates that the information source was obtained through direct observation by the speaker. Usually this is from visual observation (eyewitness), but some languages also mark information directly heard with information directly seen. A witness evidential is usually contrasted with a nonwitness evidential which indicates that the information was not witnessed personally but was obtained through a secondhand source or was inferred by the speaker.\\n\\nA secondhand evidential is used to mark any information that was not personally observed or experienced by the speaker. This may include inferences or reported information. This type of evidential may be contrasted with an evidential that indicates any other kind of source. A few languages distinguish between secondhand and thirdhand information sources.\\n\\nSensory evidentials can often be divided into different types. Some languages mark visual evidence differently from nonvisual evidence that is heard, smelled, or felt. The Kashaya language has a separate auditory evidential.\\n\\nAn inferential evidential indicates information was not personally experienced but was inferred from indirect evidence. Some languages have different types of inferential evidentials. Some of the inferentials found indicate: \\n\\nIn many cases, different inferential evidentials also indicate epistemic modality, such as uncertainty or probability (see evidentiality &amp; epistemic modality below). For example, one evidential may indicate that the information is inferred but of uncertain validity, while another indicates that the information is inferred but unlikely to be true.\\n\\nReportative evidentials indicate that the information was reported to the speaker by another person. A few languages distinguish between hearsay evidentials and quotative evidentials. Hearsay indicates reported information that may or may not be accurate. A quotative indicates the information is accurate and not open to interpretation (i.e., is a direct quotation). An example of a reportative from Shipibo (-ronki):\\n\\nThe following is a brief survey of evidential systems found in the languages of the world as identified in Aikhenvald (2004). Some languages only have two evidential markers while others may have six or more. The system types are organized by the number of evidentials found in the language. For example, a 2-term system (A) will have two different evidential markers; a 3-term system (B) will have three different evidentials. The systems are further divided by the type of evidentiality that is indicated (e.g., A1, A2, A3, etc.). Languages that exemplify each type are listed in parentheses.\\n\\nThe most common system found is the A3 type.\\n\\n2-term systems:\\n\\n3-term systems:\\n\\n4-term systems:\\n\\n5+ term systems:\\n\\nEvidential systems in many languages are often marked simultaneously with other linguistic categories. For example, a given language may use the same element to mark both evidentiality and mirativity (i.e. unexpected information). This is the case of Western Apache where the post-verbal particle  primarily functions as a mirative but also has a secondary function as an inferential evidential. This phenomenon of evidentials developing secondary functions or of other grammatical elements (e.g. miratives, modal verb) developing evidential functions is fairly widespread. The following types of mixed systems have been reported:\\n\\nIn addition to the interactions with tense, modality, and mirativity, the usage of evidentials in some languages may also depend on the clause type, discourse structure, and/or linguistic genre.\\n\\nHowever, despite the intersection of evidentiality systems with other semantic or pragmatic systems (through grammatical categories), several languages do mark evidentiality without any grammatical connection to these other semantic/pragmatic systems. More explicitly stated, there are modal systems which do not express evidentiality and evidential systems which do not express modality. Likewise, there are mirative systems which do not express evidentiality and evidential systems which do not express mirativity. Because some languages mark these separately, some linguists (e.g. Aikhenvald, de Haan, DeLancey) argue that evidentiality should be considered a distinct grammatical category, although they also admit the close connection of evidentiality to these other areas of language.\\n\\nEvidentiality is often considered to be a sub-type of epistemic modality (see, for example, Palmer 1986, Kiefer 1994). Other linguists consider evidentiality (marking the source of information in a statement) to be distinct from epistemic modality (marking the degree of confidence in a statement). An English example:\\n\\nFor instance, de Haan (1999, 2001, 2005) states that evidentiality asserts evidence while epistemic modality evaluates evidence and that evidentiality is more akin to a deictic category marking the relationship between speakers and events/actions (like the way demonstrative mark the relationship between speakers and objects, see also Joseph 2003). Aikhenvald (2003) finds that evidentials may indicate a speaker's attitude about the validity of a statement but this is not a required feature of evidentials. Additionally, she finds that evidential-marking may co-occur with epistemic-marking, but it may also co-occur with aspectual/tense or mirative marking.\\n\\nConsidering evidentiality as a type of epistemic modality may only be the result of analyzing non-European languages in terms of the systems of modality found in European languages. For example, the modal verbs in Germanic languages are used to indicate both evidentiality and epistemic modality (and are thus ambiguous when taken out of context). Other (non-European) languages clearly mark these differently. De Haan (2001) finds that the use of modal verbs to indicate evidentiality is comparatively rare (based on a sample of 200 languages).\\n\\nAlthough some linguists have proposed that evidentiality should be considered separately from epistemic modality, other linguists conflate the two. Because of this conflation, some researchers use the term evidentiality to refer both to the marking of the knowledge source and the commitment to the truth of the knowledge.\\n\\nEvidentiality is not considered a grammatical category in English because it is expressed in diverse ways and is always optional. In contrast, many other languages (including Quechua, Yukaghir) require the speaker to mark the main verb or the sentence as a whole for evidentiality, or offer an optional set of affixes for indirect evidentiality, with direct experience being the default assumed mode of evidentiality.\\n\\nConsider these English sentences:\\n\\nWe are unlikely to say the second unless someone (perhaps Bob himself) has told us that Bob is hungry. (We might still say it for someone incapable of speaking for himself, such as a baby or a pet.) If we are simply assuming that Bob is hungry based on the way he looks or acts, we are more likely to say something like:\\n\\nHere, the fact that we are relying on sensory evidence, rather than direct experience, is conveyed by our use of the word look or seem.\\n\\nAnother situation in which the evidential modality is expressed in English is in certain kinds of predictions, namely those based on the evidence at hand. Amongst EFL teachers, these are usually referred to as \"predictions with evidence\". Examples:\\n\\nThe notion of evidentiality as obligatory grammatical information was first made apparent in 1911 by Franz Boas in his introduction to The Handbook of American Indian Languages in a discussion of Kwakiutl and in his grammatical sketch of Tsimshianic. The term evidential was first used in the current linguistic sense by Roman Jakobson in 1957 in reference to Balkan Slavic (Jacobsen 1986:4; Jakobson 1990) with the following definition:\\n\\nJakobson also was the first to clearly separate evidentiality from grammatical mood. By the middle of the 1960s, evidential and evidentiality were established terms in linguistic literature.\\n\\nSystems of evidentiality have received focused linguistic attention only relatively recently. The first major work to examine evidentiality cross-linguistically is Chafe & Nichols (1986). A more recent typological comparison is Aikhenvald (2004).\\n\\n</small>\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Evolutionary grade", "body": "thumbIn alpha taxonomy, a grade refers to a level of morphological and/or physiological complexity. The term was coined by British biologist Julian Huxley, to contrast with clade, a strictly phylogenetic unit.\\n\\nAn evolutionary grade is a group of species united by morphological and/or physiological traits, that has given rise to another group that differs markedly from the ancestral condition, and is thus not considered part of the ancestral group. The ancestral group will not be phylogenetically complete (i.e. will not form a clade), so will usually represent a paraphyletic taxon.\\n\\nThe most commonly cited example is that of reptiles. In the early 19th century, the French naturalist Latreille was the first to divide tetrapod into the four familiar classes of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. In this system, reptiles are characterized by traits such as laying membranous or shelled eggs, having skin covered in scales and/or scutes, and having a 'cold-blooded' metabolism. However, the ancestors of mammals and birds also had these traits and so were reptiles in this sense, making reptiles a grade rather than a clade.\\n\\nParaphyletic taxa will often, but not always, represent evolutionary grades. In some cases paraphyletic taxa are united simply by not being part of any other groups, and give rise to so called wastebasket taxa which may even be polyphyletic.\\n\\nThe traditional Linnaean way of defining taxa is through the use of anatomical traits. When the actual phylogenetic relationship is unknown, well defined groups sometimes turn out to be defined by traits that are primitive rather than derived. In Linnaean systematics, evolutionary grades are accepted in higher taxonomic rank, though generally avoided at family level and below. In phylogenetic nomenclature evolutionary grades (or any other form of paraphyly) are not accepted.\\n\\nWhere information about phylogenetic relationships is available, organisms are preferentially grouped into clades. Where data is lacking, or groups of uncertain relationship are to be compared, the cladistic method is limited and grade provides a useful tool for comparing organisms. This is particularly common in palaeontology, where fossil are often fragmentary and difficult to interpret. Thus, palaeontological works are often using evolutionary grades as formal or informal taxa, including examples such as Labyrinthodonts, Anapsid, Synapsid, Dinosaurs, Ammonites, Eurypterid, Lobopodes and many of the more well known taxa of human evolution.\\n\\nEvolutionary grades, being united by gross morphological traits are often eminently recognizable in the field. While paraphyletic taxa are sought eliminated in taxonomy, such grades are sometimes kept as formal or informal groups on basis of their usefulness for laymen and field researchers. When referring to a group of organisms, the term \"grade\" is usually enclosed in quotation marks to denote its status as a paraphyletic term.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Evolutionary graph theory", "body": "Evolutionary graph theory is an area of research lying at the intersection of graph theory, probability theory, and mathematical biology. Evolutionary graph theory is an approach to studying how topology affects evolution of a population. That the underlying topology can substantially affect the results of the evolutionary process is seen most clearly in a paper by Lieberman, Hauert and Nowak (2005).\\n\\nIn evolutionary graph theory, individuals occupy vertices of a weighted directed graph and the weight w of an edge from vertex i to vertex j denotes the probability of i replacing j. The weight corresponds to the biological notion of fitness where fitter types propagate more readily. One property studied on graphs with two types of individuals is the fixation probability, which is defined as the probability that a single, randomly placed mutant of type A will replace a population of type B. According to the isothermal theorem, a graph has the same fixation probability as the corresponding Moran process if and only if it isothermal, thus the sum of all weights that lead into a vertex is the same for all vertices. This probability is\\n\\nwhere r is the relative fitness of the invading type. Thus, a complete graph with equal weights describes a Moran process.\\n\\nGraphs can be classified into amplifiers of selection and suppressors of selection. If the fixation probability of a single advantageous mutation  is higher than the fixation probability of the corresponding Moran process  then the graph is an amplifier, otherwise a suppressor of selection. One example of the suppressor of selection is a linear process where only vertex i-1 can replace vertex i (but not the other way around). In this case the fixation probability is  (where N is the number of vertices) since this is the probability that the mutation arises in the first vertex which will eventually replace all the other ones. Since  for all r greater than 1, this graph is by definition a suppressor of selection.\\n\\nEvolutionary graph theory may also be studied in a dual formulation, as a coalescing random walk.\\n\\nAlso evolutionary games can be studied on graphs where again an edge between i and j means that these two individuals will play a game against each other. \\n\\nClosely related stochastic processes include the voter model, which was introduced by Clifford and Sudbury (1973) and independently by Holley and Liggett (1975), and which has been studied extensively.\\n\\n1.

{"title": "Evolutionary music", "body": "Evolutionary music is the audio counterpart to Evolutionary art, whereby algorithmic music is created using an evolutionary algorithm. The process begins with a population of individuals which by some means or other produce audio (e.g. a piece, melody, or loop), which is either initialized randomly or based on human-generated music. Then through the repeated application of computational steps analogous to biological selection, recombination and mutation the aim is for the produced audio to become more musical. Evolutionary sound synthesis is a related technique for generating sounds or synthesizer instruments. Evolutionary music is typically generated using an interactive evolutionary algorithm where the fitness function is the user or audience, as it is difficult to capture the aesthetic qualities of music computationally. However, research into automated measures of musical quality is also active. Evolutionary computation techniques have also been applied to harmonization and accompaniment tasks. The most commonly used evolutionary computation techniques are genetic algorithm and genetic programming.\\n\\nNEUROGEN (Gibson &amp; Byrne, 1991) employed a genetic algorithm to produce and combine musical fragments and a neural network (trained on examples of \"real\" music) to evaluate their fitness. A genetic algorithm is also a key part of the improvisation and accompaniment system GenJam which has been developed since 1993 by Al Biles. Al and GenJam are together known as the Al Biles Virtual Quintet and have performed many times to human audiences. Since 1996 Rodney Waschka II has been using genetic algorithms for music composition including works such as  Saint Ambrose   and his string quartets. In 1997 Brad Johanson and Riccardo Poli developed the GP-Music System which, as the name implies, used genetic programming to breed melodies according to both human and automated ratings. Several systems for drum loop evolution have been produced (including one commercial program called MuSing).\\n\\nIn 2007, Springer published two books on this topic. Evolutionary Computer Music edited by John \"Al\" Biles and Eduardo Reck Miranda is devoted exclusively to evolution in music with chapters on composition, performance, and improvisation and other aspects of music production and study using genetic algorithms.

{"title": "Excursions (Barber)", "body": "Excursions, Op. 20, is the first published solo piano piece by Samuel Barber. Barber himself explains:\\n\\nThis is typical of neo-Romantic composers such as Barber. As Susan Carter explains in her Dissertation, The Piano Music of Samuel Barber, that “neo-Romantic composers returned to a style characterized by broad lyricism and dramatic expression.” She also states that the traditional structures of form from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were conserved while drawing upon a “contemporary technical vocabulary.” From a Boogie-woogie style of a five-part Rondo to a theme and variations of a well known cowboy ballad, and even to a barn yard dance with a fiddler, Barber uses each style effectively and accurately, according to the neo-Romantic ideas.\\n\\nBefore composing his Piano Sonata, Samuel Barber was asked by Jeanna Behrend, a personal friend of his and an accomplished pianist, to write a longer, more involved piece for piano that “would be appropriate to perform on one of her programs of American music.” Barber obliged, and in June 1942 the first movement of Excursions was completed. As it turns out, this piano solo set is the “sole experiment in a nationalistic vein” in Barber’s career of composing. Even Behrend herself claimed that these pieces were “excursions into a style not typical of Barber”\\n\\nIn July 1944, Vladimir Horowitz had been interested in performing works by an American composer. He was very impressed with Barber and his composing that he specifically requested to debut Excursions. At that point, Movement III had not been written yet, it was the last to be written, and so Horowitz only received Movements I, II and IV. He debuted these three pieces on January 4, 1945 at the Philadelphia Academy of Music. It was received well and in March of that year, Horowitz performed the three Excursions in New York at Carnegie Hall. The official debut of all four movements of Excursions was left to Behrend who performed them in December 1948, four years after the completion of the set.\\n\\nBarber’s first movement from Excursions shows how the composer combines classic forms with contemporary idioms. He uses many characteristics of Blues within the restrictions of classic forms to create these contemporary songs that have a familiar aspect about them.\\n\\nThe first movement of Samuel Barber’s Excursions, entitled “Un poco allegro,” is a classic five-part Rondo form. Barber begins with the main element of the movement, the bass Ostinato. This bass pattern is what brings Nathan Broder to call this movement a Boogie-woogie.” The New Grove Dictionary explains that a Boogie-woogie is \\n\\nThis left hand, bass Ostinato repeats itself, almost exactly, twenty-two times within the A section alone. As stated above, this repetitive nature of the left hand, under an improvisatory right, is a characteristic of a Boogie-woogie.\\n\\nThe overall form of Movement I is the classic, Rondo form. Russell Friedewald, in his dissertation entitled A Formal and Stylistic Analysis of the Published Music of Samuel Barber, divides the sections of this movement into ABACA Coda. His reasoning for this division of the sections is based upon the bass note of the Ostinato pattern. From the beginning of the movement through measure 37, the bass Ostinato stays on C. In measures 38 through 55, the bass Ostinato moves to F, signifying the B section.\\n\\nSections A, A, and A are in the tonic key while B is under the sub-dominant (F) key and C is in the dominant (G) key. The overall I-IV-I-V-I progression is very simple but it provides a “structural unity of this piece in which motivic material freely crosses sectional boundaries.”\\n\\nThe first A section introduces the main melodic pattern that can be found within other sections of the movement, which can be seen in measures 4 through 6.\\n\\nThis figure contains three repeated E-flats followed by a broken tonic triad. In measure six, there is an added B-flat creating a seventh-chord on C. The seventh of the tonic C minor triad does not function correctly in a typical harmonic progression; it is actually treated as a consonant note. These types of harmonies as well as the heavily syncopated rhythms are characteristics “commonly used in blues and Jazz.” \\n\\nBoth Sifferman and Carter mention Barber’s use of the “blue” notes in this movement. The Blue-note,” which is the third, seventh, and occasionally the fifth, would be sung or played a semitone lower than the diatonic pitch. Initially, musicologists thought that blues singers were using, for example, the E-flat and B-flat in the key of C major, but the “downhome” blues musicians tended to bend, or “worry,” the notes, rather than actually change tones. In Barber’s movement, the lowered third and seventh scale degrees already exist within the key signature as consonant tones. Although the Blue-note exist in the key signature, Barber utilizes the raised tones as well.\\n\\nIn measure 4, for instance, the repeated E-flat is heavily emphasized as well as the whole C minor triad through measure five. Just a few bars later in measure 10, we see the raised third, an E-natural. Also the first appearance of the raised seventh scale degree occurs enharmonically as a C-flat in measure 41. It proceeds to the B-flat when the A section returns in bar 56. Carter takes it a step further and shows how the G-flat, the lowered scale degree five and a tri-tone from C, are emphasized.\\n\\nNew Grove’s definition of Boogie-woogie includes the term “momentum” as a characteristic. Barber creates forward motion with quarter-notes followed by eighth- and sixteenth-notes in quick succession. Through the use of this rhythm, the momentum of the music quickens until bars 9 through 13, where the rhythm slows down.\\n\\nThe sixteenth notes on beats four and five of measure nine is the beginning of the slowing down momentum. Measure 10 starts slowing the rhythm by the use of eighth-notes, quarter-note triplets, and finally, quarter-notes, when the primary motive pattern returns in measure 13.\\n\\nAnother instance where the momentum of the piece begins to slow down is right before the start of the A section. Six measures before 90, the right hand melody consists of straight sixteenth-notes creating a very fast pace. In bar 92, the right hand chords allude to the rhythm of the main melodic pattern found in bar 4, but at a slightly slower pace. This same rhythmic pattern, a dotted quarter-note followed by a half-note and quarter-note triplet, persists for twelve measures until measure 103, when we see a change. Each following measure continues to slow down the momentum that has been building throughout the entire piece until the Coda in measure 107.\\n\\nThese momentum shifts also help to create “textual contrasts [that] define each section.” The A and A sections only utilize two voice textures. Sections B and C contain quick rhythmic chords in the right hand, and in the A section, the right hand contains rhythmically broader chords.\\n\\nAnother term by which The New Grove Dictionary defines a Boogie-woogie is “volume.” In this movement, any one of the sections can contain a pp dynamic marking (m. 11, 56, 84-91, and 106 to the end) all the way up to a ff (m. 53, 77, 80-83). This highly contrasting dynamic range in one movement is an aspect of the Boogie-woogie that creates attention and interest.\\n\\nBarber describes these Excursions by stating that the characteristics, “reminiscent of local instruments, are easily recognized.” There are instances in this movement, and the others, that bring up certain instruments that could be “playing” the melody. Sifferman imagines the “main theme (m. 4-9) played on saxophone, while the right hand figure in measures 44-46 sounds like [a] harmonica, imitating the alternately in and out breath motions.”\\n\\nAccording to Sifferman, the F major chords in the right hand on beats one and three, starting half-way through measure 45, are the tones that are created when air is “blown into” a harmonica. The tones that occur when breath is “drawn in” through the instrument comprise the B major seventh chord. On a typical diatonic harmonica, the tones that are created when air is drawn through the instrument correspond to the dominant of the key of the instrument, not the tri-tone. This further illustrates Barber’s use of the tri-tone in this movement.\\n\\nBarber uses the bass Ostinato, the “blue” chords, improvisatory melodic lines and characteristics that are similar to instruments to achieve an idiomatic style within classic limitations.\\n\\nThe second movement, entitled ‘In slow blues tempo,’ encapsulates the popular American idiom, a “rich and elegant blues.” Barber uses “conventional harmonic progressions and melodic and rhythmic features associated with blues” to continue the overarching idea of the American idiom within classic form.\\n\\nMovement II contains four twelve-bar phrases that utilize harmonies very similar to Movement I. Russell Friedewald was the first individual to formally analyze this set of Excursions in 1957. His explanation for this movement is the clearest: “the second in this set, a rich and elegant blues, is divided into four twelve-measure sections, each being improvisatory in nature.” \\n\\nAs previously mentioned, this movement is what New Grove calls “twelve- bar blues.”\\n\\nThe typical harmonic structure of Blues, as identified by New Grove, is the Twelve-bar blues.\\n\\nBecause blues is based on improvisation, having a common and familiar chord progression lends itself to an easier improvisation. Not every blues progression is exactly the same, but this one in particular is very common, and Barber uses this progression almost exactly. What ties this movement with the first is the harmonic progression. The boogie-woogie, which is “a style of piano blues,” also contains the chord progression I-IV-I-V-I.\\n\\nEach large phrase of a Twelve-bar blues is broken up into three sub-phrases consisting of four measures each. In the third sub-phrase, the third measure contains two harmonic possibilities. In the first and third 12-bar phrases of Barber’s movement, the subdominant harmony (C) occurs after the dominant harmony (D); however, in the second and fourth 12-bar phrases, the subdominant does not occur, but rather the tonic appears. The harmonic movement from V → IV → I, creating a plagal-type of cadence, is weaker than the V → V → I movement. When Barber uses this type of movement in the last 12-bar phrase, it creates a strong closing gesture. This is one way in which Barber strays from the typical 12-bar blues form.\\n\\nAnother way that Barber differs from the typical 12-bar blues pattern is that on the first, second and fourth occurrence of the phrase, there is an added measure to each. The first 12-bar phrase, measure 1 through 13, has its repeated measure at the end of the phrase. Through means of extension by repetition, measure 13 is identical to bar 12. The second and fourth phrases do not contain a repeated measure at the end of the phrase. \\n\\nIn Phrase 2, measure 14 through 26, there is an extension by repetition from measures 14 to 16. Those three measures can be grouped together as can measures 17 and 18 for their melodic similarities. Measures 14 to 16 all contain the melodic bass figure and a parallel right hand pattern as well. The next two measures are the second half of that sub-phrase. The right hand chord is a G major triad with an added second underneath a B to G eighth-note triplet pattern.\\n\\nThe exact extension that occurred in Phrase 2 also occurs in Phrase 4 due to their striking similarities. Even though the right hand motive in Phrase 4 begins a third higher, it is still very similar to Phrase 2’s occurrence. Measure 39 is repeated twice instead of just one time with a few slight alterations to the rhythmic patterns before moving to the G major triad with an added second in bar 42. Barber uses this addition of one measure to some of the 12-bar phrases. By doing this, he makes the overall structure atypical compared to the standard 12-bar phrase.\\n\\nAs mentioned briefly before, there are unifying phrases throughout the 12-bar phrases that help to connect each section we the other. One way in which Barber unifies all of these sections is through the use of specific melodic figures. The left hand bass figure in measures 1 to 2 is used ten times in this movement.\\n\\n“The rhythmic pattern of the accompaniment motive is a common blues figure.” The other, and more important, unifying motive is the descending third melodic figure within the right hand. This figure occurs at the start of every new 12-bar phrase. Within this movement one can find this descending motive returning in either the left or the right hand.\\n\\nThe harmonies of this movement consist of strictly the tonic (G), subdominant (C), and dominant (D) tonalities. However there is some debates as to whether this movement is indeed in G, or as the key signature says, C. Friedewald claims that this movement is centered on C with each section being “limited to the tonic and dominant chord.” However, through closer analysis, this piece is centered on G. Sifferman explains that “simply listening to or playing the piece… makes the tonal center [of] G undeniably clear to the ear.”\\n\\nIn Friedewald’s defense, this movement’s key signature indicates C major, there are a fair number of G dominant seventh chords, and the final chord of the piece is a perfect fifth on C. There is some truth in saying this movement is in C, but Barber most likely chose not to include a key signature to further emphasize the “blue” notes, specifically, the lowered sevenths. If we choose to analyze this movement in G major, the “absence of a sharp in the key signature is accounted for by the… F-natural.” This further explains that the F-naturals which occur within the tonic harmonies were not written for the purpose of creating dominant seventh chords. “By avoiding the F-sharp in the key signature, the lowered seventh is established as a constant pitch, while the use of the leading tone is the exception.”\\n\\nIn the first measure, Barber incorporates another “blue” note, the lowered third. The B-flat (enharmonically spelled A-sharp) creating “increased tension or dissonance… harmonically.” Barber continues, throughout this movement with the added “blue” notes that create the harmonic tension characteristic of a blues piece.\\n\\nIn measures 19 through 22 Barber emphasizes the raised and lowered third scale degrees in the left hand octaves. This first begins with the pick up B-natural. Additionally, Barber makes use of the lowered seventh scale degree, F-natural as a melodic tone over the tonic chord. This further demonstrates Barber’s “bending or worrying” particular scale degrees to create a blues mood.\\n\\nClearly the slowest movement of all four, this piece has a subtle uniqueness about it that makes it stand out from the rest. This is especially heard in the final chord of the movement. The movement ends on the subdominant harmony which Sifferman believes it ends as “though the progression could continue ‘ad infinitum.’”\\n\\nBarber’s third movement of Excursions, entitled “Allegretto,” is a theme and variations described by Broder as “a sophisticated set of variations on a charming folk-like melody.” There is no doubt that this movement’s melodic nature is that of a folk tune, but there is some debate if this was a pre-existing tune at the time Barber arranged it. It was not until Allan Kozinn published an interview with Samuel Barber in 1981 that the author confirmed that this movement was based on the tune “Streets of Laredo.” There is, however, still some uncertainty.\\n\\nJames Sifferman, in his thesis, states:\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen listening to the tune “Streets of Laredo,” one can clearly hear the melodic similarity to Barber’s third movement. Furthermore, when looking at a score of the folk tune, one can easily see the connection between the two pieces. It is highly unlikely that Barber based only a small portion of the movement on the folk tune.\\n\\nBoth consequent phrases of “Streets of Laredo” and the theme from Barber’s “Allegretto” begin on a D-flat and proceed to descend to the D-flat an octave below. In measure 9 of the ballad, the first D-flat is being prolonged through moving to an inner voice of the I harmony, the B-flat, before moving to the C in bar 10. An upper neighbor, the D-flat, also prolongs the C before continuing to descend. This descent ends in measure 12 on the lower D-flat.\\n\\nThis motion is also evident in the “Allegretto” stretching from measures 5 and 6. The first D-flat moves to the B-flat by way of an incomplete neighbor, the A-flat. It then moves up by step into the C before descending down to the lower octave D-flat. This register change is clearly seen in both the “Streets of Laredo” and in the “Allegretto.”\\n\\nStarting at the lower octave D-flat in the ballad, there is an initial upward skip of a fourth followed by a prolongation of the G-flat by a lower-neighbor, the F. Then the melody rises by step to the C before stepping down to the B-flat and eventually skipping to the G-flat. Finally, to cadence the tune, the melody steps up into the G-flat before returning to the final G-flat.\\n\\nEven when briefly analyzed, the “Allegretto” contains almost the exact melodic line from the cowboy ballad. Beginning on the low D-flat in measure 6, which is the last note of the septuplet in the melody, the ballad is explicitly borrowed in this section. There are two places in which the two tunes are not exact: the first is measure 13 of the ballad and the second in measure 7 of the “Allegretto.” In measure 13 of the ballad, there is a lower-neighbor (F) that prolongs the G-flat; in Barber’s movement, the G-flat (m. 7) is simply repeated without the neighbor. \\n\\nThe F in bar 13 of the “Streets of Laredo” tune is not as significant as other tones in the melody because of its treatment as a non-chord tone. That Barber chose not to carry that note over to his arrangement of the tune is not detrimental to the overall shape of the melodic line. When analyzing that beat more closely, there is, in fact, a non-chord tone that acts as a lower-neighbor. That non-chord tone is the D-flat to the E-flat. Even though Barber did not include the original F lower-neighbor in the melody, there is still one included; however it is simply not in the original position. The other location in which Barber has taken liberty with his arrangement of the consequent phrase of the tune is in the first two beats of measure 8. Barber has chosen to repeat the B-flat instead of immediately moving to the G-flat like in the ballad.\\n\\nSifferman’s analysis of this movement claims that there is some uncertainty whether or not Barber “consciously borrowed” the tune “Streets of Laredo” for this arrangement. There is no direct evidence in previous research that states Barber’s intentions with this movement. However, when analyzed more closely, one can clearly see that there is no question about this matter. Barber undoubtedly borrows this melody, if not, quotes it exactly.\\tThe first eight measure phrase is broken into four measures of the antecedent and four measures of the consequent phrase, creating a “binary theme,” a + b. The harmonic progression consists of a two-measure pattern using the I, vi, ii and V chords. There is one alteration to that harmonic progression in measure 7 where the tonic harmony should return to begin a new two-measure pattern. Instead of the tonic sonority, the vi chord appears which immediately moves the harmonic rhythm forward half a measure. In measure 8, the dominant chord occurs for the entire measure, making up for the lost half measure in 7. The last measure of the theme, measure 8 is typically harmonized as I6/4 to V.\\n\\nThis repetitive harmonic progression dominates the entire movement, implying a harmonic ostinato beneath the melody. As seen in the first and the second movements, the third movement utilizes a basic harmonic progression to lay the framework for a seemingly improvisatory melody and variations later on in the piece. \\n\\nThe first few measures of this movement show some very unusual rhythmic organization in the right hand. In Carter’s performance analysis of this movement, she explains “this movement poses the greatest number of technical and rhythmic problems for the performer.” She goes on to say that Barber, through this very unusual rhythm of seven against eight, disguises the original theme. This rhythm is very difficult to play because when the two hands are playing together, the only time the beats align is on the downbeat of each measure. Despite this difficult rhythm, Barber “achieves a piquant, casual” and “overall easy-going bright and cheery mood.”\\n\\nWhen listening to this piece, there seems to be a free, “bar-less feeling” throughout the main theme. This is accomplished through the unusual rhythmic organization in the right hand. It is also accomplished in the root of specific chords not occurring on the strong beats. Arriving on the fifth of a chord as the lowest sounding pitch (second inversion) is a weak voicing and does not create strong harmonic movement. The submediant chord arrives in root position on the off-beat of beat three, losing the strong middle pulse of a measure. This also occurs on the V chord, but instead of arriving on the fifth of the chord, it actually arrives on the root. However, immediately after that, the left hand moves an octave down, implying the “true” arrival of the dominant.\\n\\nThe first variation begins in measure 9, but the a phrase does not change from its first statement at the beginning of the movement. Only when the b section arrives in bar 13 is there a change of the original theme. Instead of continuing the seven-against-eight melodic line, Barber uses heavily syncopated, blocked sixteenth chords in the right hand, with the top note in each chord as the main melodic tone. While that is taking place, the left hand continues the eighth notes for two beats before switching to quintuplets for two beats. \\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, each blocked chord in the right hand consists of the melody in the top voice with the basic harmonic progression. However, Barber incorporates an added second or fourth. With those added tones, the triads can be considered cluster chords, or, more likely in this specific instance, as extended tertian harmonies of the basic progression. When analyzed as extended tertian, measures 13 and 14 are I, vi, ii, and V. This is another way that the melodic theme is “disguised” within the harmonies.\\n\\nWhen Variation I completes at the end of measure 16, Variation II begins the a phrase in the original version, except at an octave above. When the b phrase appears, it occurs within the same octave as the a section, with a slightly more complex sixteenth-note rhythm in the right hand. At the same time, the eighth-note followed by a quintuplet pattern continues. This variation is similar to Variation I in this manner.\\n\\nVariation III occurs in measure 25. This is the first variation that does not start with the a section, but rather, with the b section. Carter explains that in “most variation forms, the theme gradually becomes more obscured, as illustrated by the third variation.” Barber uses more complex rhythms between the right and left hands. The right hand uses dotted sixteenth-notes, triplets, and sextuplets, while the left hand plays the implied ostinato harmonic progression in quintuplets. The b section is repeated with increased complexity of rhythms: dotted sixteenth-note to thirty-second note patterns. Measure 32 contains a large scale that ascends from the C to the high Bb.\\n\\nIn measure 33, Barber has written a scale with the mood of the section in mind. Every time a cluster appears, it occurs on the two or three consecutive black keys on the piano. Barber composed this passage so that the listener can perceive the entire span of the scale in a shorter amount of time without sounding frantic or rushed. This variation has a natural flowing feeling throughout, and for Barber to include the scale in this manner helps to add to that effect.\\n\\nVariation IV begins in measure 33 with the original occurrence of the a phrase. When the b section appears in measure 37, it is the first time that the melody is heard in the left hand rather the right. The b melody is played with open blocked chords consisting of primarily sixths in parallel motion, creating a new sonority during the b section. The right hand has a constant sixteenth-note ostinato pattern that has an octave displacement every two beats. This section is also the first time in the movement that the rhythmic organization of the melody is simple with a few slightly syncopated dotted eighth- to sixteenth-note fragments. These less complicated rhythms are consistent throughout the rest of the movement until the next variation.\\n\\nAt the start of Variation V in measures 41 through 44, the constant sixteenth-notes of the right hand now continues in both hands. This variation consists of two statements of the consequent phrase from the original theme, instead of the typical a plus b phrases. The right hand continues with a new ostinato pattern involving D-flat and E-flat rather than C and D-flat. It is similar to the previous variation, but still uses a two-octave displacement. The left hand utilizes sixteenth-note arpeggiations down from the main accented melodic tone. \\n\\nIn the music, Barber shows the distinction between the melody and the arpeggiations through the use of upward-facing stems. For a performer, this can be very difficult to execute due to the need to accent certain tones of constant sixteenth-note pattern to bring out the melody. This effect creates the feeling of two accompaniment voices alongside a third primary melodic voice.The second consequent phrase of Variation V, measures 45 through 48. The rhythmic pattern of the constant sixteenth-notes continues, but for the first two bars the melody cannot be seen explicitly.\\n\\nThe harmonic progression of the first two measures of the b phrase is still preserved; however the melodic line is much more ambiguous. There is one tone that does not exist in the melody, that is the A-flat that should occur in third or fourth beats of measure 45. The B-flat occurs on the very last sixteenth-note of the measure, but there is not an A-flat. The A-flat in the original melody is treated as an incomplete neighbor tone to the B-flat, so for it not to be present in this variation is not of much importance. \\n\\nAnother instance in which the melody is not exact is in measure 46. Here, the D-flat occurs before the F, but because both of those tones are a part of the overall V harmony, the importance is focused on the harmonic movement back to the tonic, rather than the specific melodic movement. In measure 47, the top G-flat in the right hand has an arrow next to it showing the start of the rest of the melody in the top voice of the right hand.\\n\\nFrom Susan Carter’s dissertation, she explains the next section, Variation VI.\\n\\nThis variation uses both antecedent and consequent phrases of the original theme, differing from the previous variation. Measure 55 consists of the septuplet melody in the right hand over constant eighth-note movement in parallel octaves by the left hand. This re-introduces the seven-against-eight rhythmic organization heard in the original theme.\\n\\nAs Variation VII begins, the unusual rhythmic organization continues in both consequent phrases. The second b phrase is written an octave higher with some mode mixture within the melody and harmony in the first two measures, 61 and 62. Typically the last variation, number VIII, or the Coda, which begins in measure 65, restates the original theme. In this case, Barber restates the a phrase, and in bar 69, the a begins as if to repeat itself, however it becomes modified. The last two measures slow down rhythmically, creating a gentle feeling to end the coda section and the overall movement.\\n\\nAs a theme and variations movement with seven different variations and a final coda, Barber is able to expand a popular and much loved cowboy ballad many different ways. With the difficult and unusual rhythmic organization that continually becomes more challenging, he provides the performer an opportunity to show their skill.\\n\\nSamuel Barber’s Movement IV of his set of Excursions is an “exuberant and joyous barn dance,” and functions as the finale of the complete set. This movement in particular captures the idiomatic sounds and styles of a fiddler and his or her accompanying harmonica or accordion player. With a tonal center on F, the primary harmonies used are F-major and B-flat major chords, the I and IV harmonies respectively. Added tones are also frequently used.\\n\\nThe form of this movement was first called a “frame form” by Friedewald in his dissertation. The A section from measures 1 to 13, the B from measure 14 to 56 and the return of A’, measures 56 through 70. However, the B section can be further analyzed as its own type of ternary form (a: m. 14-23, a’: m. 24-33, b: m. 34-40, a: m. 41-48, retransition: m. 49-56). This way of analyzing the B section tends to be more truthful to what actually occurs in the music.\\n\\nSifferman takes the form of this movement a step further by explaining that this movement can be analyzed in an arch form. “The idea of the two A sections being merely a frame seems unjustified in view of their relative length and substance.” Viewing this movement as an arch form combines both Friedewald’s analysis of the frame form with better explaining the larger B section. With this analysis, the larger B section now is broken up into B, C and a retransition section.\\n\\nIn the very beginning of this movement, Barber presents two motives upon which he expands throughout the rest of the piece. The initial blocked chords consisting of the tonic and subdominant harmonies is Motive 1. Because of the strict limitation of harmonies, the music seems to imply that this is idiomatic to a harmonica. The next two measures introduce another voice consisting of a repeated pattern of sixteenth-notes while the harmonica accompaniment continues. This fast paced sixteenth rhythm implies a fiddle-like feeling. The combination of the fiddle and harmonica, create these two voices that move “like freely improvised parts over the simple alternation of tonic and subdominant harmonies.”\\n\\nBarber uses these two motives, with slightly altered versions, multiple times within this piece. In measure 6, the alternating tonic to subdominant chord Motive 1 pattern returns for one measure before moving to the sixteenth-note pattern in measure 7. The Motive 2 lasts for 3 bars instead of the regular 2. In measure 10 the texture changes over the tonic harmony, beginning the transition into the B section. In bar 12 there is an added non-chord tone, the G-sharp that adds color and intensity to the tonic harmony. Motive 2 appears returning multiple times in measures 19, 21, 28, 31, and 33.\\n\\nThe B section starts on measure 14 and ends in bar 22 followed by a transition to B in measure 23. There is another motive that Barber composed that is only found with in the three middle sections of this movement. Motive 3 is the left hand pattern that occurs in measures 14 through 17 can be found two other times in the movement (measures 24 and 41). The Motive 3 pattern and the proceeding melody that occurs after is very idiomatic to the fiddle while the accompaniment pattern continues to be similar to the harmonica.\\n\\nThe transition in measure 23 that moves the piece from B to B has a similarity to the transitional measure in bar 12. The added G-sharp creates a tension and intensity to move the piece forward. These first two B sections start at a mf and slowly crescendo all the way to ff in measure 31. Barber uses the Motive 2 multiple times during this passage and each time it appears, the dynamic level is altered in some way. In bar 19, Motive 2 “fiddling” through its sixteenth-notes on f after crescendo-ing into that. In measures 28 and 31, Motive 2 is restated again, except these two times, both are stated in an octave and two octaves higher respectively.\\n\\nSection B ends in measure 33 and in bar 34, the C phrase begins. With the added “con forza” and it still being ff, Barber includes shows how these two measures are the most important of the entire piece. These two measures is a modified restatement of the Motive 1. Instead of alternating quarter-notes triads, Barber creates more intensity with syncopated eighth- and sixteenth-note rhythms. (see Ex. 19) Also the alternating tonic to subdominant harmonies unifies this movement through every section.\\n\\nIt is still ff until measure 36 when the dynamic changes to mp. Not only does the dynamics change, but a new melodic idea is introduced. This new melody occurs in the right hand in parallel third motion. The occurrence of this one-bar melodic idea is the only time in the piece that Barber uses it.\\n\\nNot only does measure 36 contain a melodic rhythm that is only heard once, it also contains E-flats in the accompaniment as well as beat four in the right hand. As previously discussed in Movement II of the Excursions set, Barber uses “blue” notes that are characteristic of the blues style. These “blue” notes are typically the thirds or sevenths that have been bended or “worried” lower than their traditional diatonic tones. In this instance, Barber uses the “blue” E-flat starting in measure 36 and lasting through measure 40 before B returns. In measure 40, the transition from C back to B contains A-flat and E-flat seventh chords, varying briefly from the limited harmonies of the tonic and subdominant.\\n\\nThe B section starting in measure 41 is an exact repetition of the B section that began in measure 14. However, measure 17 of B does not repeat as it should in bar 44 of the B phrase. Motive 3 reappears in this section in the left hand as does Motive 2 in measures 45 and 47 of the right. Beginning in measure 49, a retransition occurs to bring the original A section back. This retransition continues to alternate between the tonic and subdominant harmonies but also contains many added tones. This sixteenth-note rhythms and chords are fairly syncopated, but Barber includes accent marks over the certain beats to further enhance the syncopation. Even though starting in measure 53 there is a diminuendo included, the motion and intensity is still preserved through the “stringendo a poco a poco.”\\n\\nAfter ending the retransition section from B to A on a middle C, Barber alters the original Motive 1 again. The beginning of the A section alters Motive 1 with “appoggiaturas built on chromatic quartal harmonies.” Sifferman hears these chromatic grace notes as imitations of “the sound achieved through breathing alternately in and out on a harmonica.” Barber continues to imitate the sounds of common instruments within this barn-yard dance movement.\\n\\nAfter measure 58, there is a literal restatement of the original A from the beginning of the movement. The closing section begins to conclude the movement starting at measure 66 on a tonic harmony with an added sixth, D. After a four-measure decrescendo into measure 69 on a pp, bar 70 ends the movement with an arpeggiated F extended Tertian harmony. This “blues ninth chord” is another instance how Barber creates aspects that “idiomatic to the harmonica.”\\n\\nThroughout this entire movement, either in the right or left hand, there is a clear melodic line on a single tone or in thirds. Accompanying that melody is another voice that is strictly chordal and only limited vocabulary of harmonies. In this stylized barn dance, Barber recreates the American idiom of a fiddler with another person accompanying them on the harmonica or accordion.\\n\\nIn this work, Samuel Barber utilizes various American idioms as a means of exploring the abundant styles of music rooted in the cultures and history of the United States. Composing in styles such as blues, a cowboy ballad, and a barnyard dance, Barber is able to convey the many different nuances of American folk music, according to his neo-Romantic ideas. Although these movements are not some of his most influential works, they are still pieces worthy of study and of continued performance.\\n\\n"}

They produced the EP Deduction in 2002 and released their album Perfekta in 2004 which shortly appeared on #42 in the Austrian charts. They didn't reach a broad audience with their Funk rock music style. After Gerhard Bergauer had left the band in May 2005, Martin Scheer appeared at the drums. Funkalicious redefined themselves as Excuse Me Moses and emphasized their style on rock music.\\n\\nIn 2005 the band took part in the Ö3 Soundcheck band contest arranged by the Austrian radio station Hitradio Ö3.

{"title": "Executive Decision", "body": "Executive Decision is a 1996 action film, directed by Stuart Baird and starring Kurt Russell, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt, Steven Seagal and David Suchet. The original music was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The film was released in the United States on March 15, 1996.\\n\\nTerrorists have hijacked a Boeing 747 en route from Athens to Washington, D.C., demanding in exchange for the hostage the release of terrorist El Sayed Jaffa, who had been recently captured and taken into United States custody.\\n\\nIt is discovered that the terrorists are actually planning an attack on Washington, D.C., placing a bomb on the airplane that will release a large amount of nerve gas on detonation.\\n\\nA plan is devised to place a small team of United States Army Special Forces into the plane mid-flight to retake control and disable the bomb. If they are not successful, the decision to shoot down the aircraft before it reaches United States airspace is made, trading the lives of the approximately 400 innocent passengers to save the lives of hundreds of thousand people on the ground. This decision is an \"executive decision\", meaning that it must be specifically approved by the President of the United States.\\n\\nLieutenant Colonel Austin Travis (Steven Seagal) leads an unsuccessful raid on a Chechen mafia safehouse by a United States Army special forces team to recover a stolen Soviet nerve agent, DZ-5. \\n\\nDavid Grant (Kurt Russell), Ph.D, a United States Naval Academy graduate and now a consultant for Army intelligence, is informed that the world's most feared terrorist, El Sayed Jaffa (Andreas Katsulas), has been taken into custody. Shortly after, Oceanic Airlines Flight 343, a Boeing 747-200, leaves Athens bound for Washington Dulles International Airport. It is hijacked by Jaffa's number two man, Nagi Hassan (David Suchet), and a number of Jaffa's men.\\n\\nDr. Grant is summoned to the Pentagon to join a team led by Travis which is being readied to intercept the hijacked plane. They listen to Nagi Hassan's demand for the release of Jaffa. Grant, however, does not believe Hassan wants Jaffa released. He believes that Hassan actually arranged for Jaffa's capture, that the hijacked plane is carrying a bomb loaded with DZ-5, and that Hassan wants to detonate the bomb over U.S. airspace.\\n\\nA plan is worked out that will involve a mid-air transfer of a commando team onto the hijacked airliner using an experimental \"Remora\" aircraft. The plan is approved, and Colonel Travis assembles his commando team at Andrews Air Force Base. They board with Dr. Grant and engineer Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt).\\n\\nThe boarding is only partially successful. When Sergeant \"Cappy\" Matheny (Joe Morton) is seriously injured, Grant, who was supposed to stay put, boards to help lift him into the plane. The 747 pulls up, though, putting too much stress on the boarding sleeve. Unable to board the plane, Colonel Travis sacrifices himself when he closes the 747's hatch, just as the sleeve breaks and he is thrown from the F-117. The remainder of the commando team make it to the 747's lower deck, but with half their equipment, so military command on the ground does not know whether or not the commandos made it on board. \\n\\nWith limited options, the commandos begin to search for the supposed DZ-5 bomb. Grant manages to make contact with a stewardess, Jean (Halle Berry), despite Hassan's suspicions, and asks her for assistance in finding the bomb's remote detonator.\\n\\nOfficials decide to release Jaffa in order to resolve the situation. Meanwhile, Cappy and Cahill locate and start to dismantle the bomb. They discover that bomb's arming device is barometrically activated. They seemingly disarm the bomb, but it is revealed that there is another trigger. \\n\\nJaffa calls Hassan from a private jet, telling him he is free, but Hassan will not be swayed from his plan. Grant realizes that only Hassan knows about the bomb, but none of his men do—which means there is a sleeper on board—one passenger among 400.\\n\\nSenator Mavros (J.T. Walsh) is called away from his seat to have a word with the president but finds he is not speaking to him. Then Hassan points a gun to his head and Mavros tries in vain to get the president but is shot in the head.\\n\\nJean spots a man with an electronic device and informs Grant. Meanwhile, the commandos manage to use the plane's taillights and Morse code to signal to U.S. fighter jet that they are on board and not to shoot them down.\\n\\nGrant and Jean enter the passenger cabin and take the suspect by surprise, but what Jean thought was an electronic device was merely a case of diamonds. Grant spots the real sleeper: Jean-Paul Demou, the man who built the bomb. Hassan attempts to fire at Grant, but is shot from behind by the on-board air marshal. The commandos storm the plane, and a firefight ensues, resulting in a break in the airplane wall, sucking out three passengers and Demou; however, all of the terrorists are killed, the bomb is finally disarmed and plane regains its stability.\\n\\nIn a last act of desperation, Hassan kills both pilots, hoping the bomb will detonate if the plane crashes, but he is killed by Captain Rat. Grant is forced to attempt to land the 747, despite his limited piloting experience. He misses the Dulles runway, but recognizes the Frederick airport where he normally practices flying and decides to try there. With Jean's assistance, he makes a sloppy but relatively safe landing.\\n\\nOriginally developed at Paramount, the studio put the project in turnaround and sold to Warner Bros. in exchange for the rights and screenplay to Forrest Gump. Executive Decision was considered a hot project while Forrest Gump was going through multiple problems with the script and casting.\\n\\nThe film received full cooperation from The Pentagon. One alteration to the screenplay was the removal of the President of the United States (he is said to be out of the country and does not appear on screen); his part in the story was taken by the Secretary of Defense played by Len Cariou.\\n\\nSteven Seagal had a fairly minor role in the film, and his character was killed early on, despite being one of the more well-known of the actors to appear in the film, and a major action star at the time. Furthermore, Seagal is not cited in the opening credits, but Seagal's image was used heavily in advertising for the movie due to his enormous popularity to movie goers.\\n\\nOceanic Airlines is a fictional airline often used in action movies and TV series involving ill-fated air planes. Some scenes from this film were used in other films and TV series.\\n\\nThe external shots of the Oceanic Airlines 747 depicts the 747-200 version of the aircraft, yet all the cockpit scenes in the movie feature the much more modern glass cockpit of the newer 747-400 which has a longer upper deck than the -200 model as well. The same discrepancy occurs in the movie Turbulence - a common incongruity in motion pictures which involve scenes in the cockpit.\\n\\nSome early model Boeing 747s flown by United and American (some also later went to Pan Am second hand from UA and AA) used to have lower-lobe galleys with service elevators. However, later standard 747s no longer featured the lower-lobe galleys. The only commercial aircraft where this feature was standard on were the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar 1, 100, 200, 250 and some models of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 depending on how the airlines ordered it. \\n\\nKurt Russell is shown in an opening scene piloting a Beechcraft Bonanza. Kurt Russell was actually flying the airplane and it is seen making an approach into Chino, California. The scene is spliced into a ramp scene from Van Nuys airport. The ground scenes were filmed in Van Nuys, with Van Nuys standing in for Maryland. \\n\\nThe scene involving the F-14 interception was the last film appearance of Squadron VF-84 before being disestablished.\\n\\nThis film is also known under the name Critical Decision, for the Dutch/Belgian market; Ultime Decision, for France; the German title was Einsame Entscheidung and Final Decision in South Korea.\\n\\n"}

Access to DNA testing varies greatly by degree; post-conviction tests can be difficult to acquire. Organizations like the Innocence Project are particularly concerned with the exoneration of those who have been convicted based on weak evidence.

{"title": "Experimental Mechanized Force", "body": "The Experimental Mechanized Force was a brigade-sized formation of the British Army. It was officially formed on 27 August 1927, and was intended to investigate and develop the techniques and equipment required for armoured warfare. It was renamed the Experimental Armoured Force the following year. Over a period of two years, it participated in several exercises which proved the capabilities of mechanised forces against traditionally-organised and trained infantry and cavalry but also generated violent arguments within the Army. The Force was finally dispersed in February 1929.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of World War I, several theorists sought ways to avoid the indecisive nature of trench warfare, with its associated heavy casualties. One weapon which had shown promise was the tank. Colonel J. F. C. Fuller, formerly the Chief of Staff of the Tank Corps, proposed an all-tank force, which would operate independently against enemy headquarters and lines of communication. More moderate theorists such as the historian and former British Army officer Basil Liddell Hart advocated mechanised forces of all arms, able to carry out operations of war other than the all-out offensive. A third influential reformer, Colonel Giffard LeQuesne Martel proposed that tanks should nevertheless be subordinated to infantry formations, while the large number of influential cavalry officers maintained that the horse still had a part to play on a modern battlefield, in spite of all evidence to the contrary on the Western Front in World War I.\\n\\nAt the instigation of General George Milne, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the Secretary of State for War, Laming Worthington-Evans, decreed the formation of the Experimental Mechanized Force in October 1925. Milne was already inclined against the pure tank theorists, and organised the force as a balanced force of all arms, so far as resources allowed. After the units concerned had completed their training on their new equipment, the Force officially came into existence at Tidworth on Salisbury Plain in August 1927.\\n\\nColonel Fuller had originally been considered for appointment as commander of the Force, but he turned it down, as it was combined with command of an infantry brigade and the administrative responsibilities connected with the garrison of Tidworth. The War Office refused to allot extra staff to assist him, and Fuller believed he would be unable to devote himself to the Force and its methods and tactics. Instead, Colonel R. J. Collins, whose professional background was light infantry, was appointed to command the Experimental Force.\\n\\nThe force was composed of:\\n\\nOver the next two years, the Force participated in several exercises on Salisbury Plain, the traditional training area of the British Army, which was generally open with firm going, and therefore ideal for mechanised units. The Force's operations were almost invariably judged to be successful by the umpires. Its all-arms composition generally vindicated Liddell Hart's concepts, as the Force was able to undertake operations such as opposed river crossings which would have been impossible for an all-tank force. Nevertheless, Liddell Hart complained that the Force's operations were too small in scope and always served as an adjunct to larger, traditionally organised forces, rather than demonstrating that mechanised forces could operate independently and be strategically decisive.\\n\\nAnother shortcoming which the exercises highlighted was that the infantry's lorries could not keep up with the tanks on rough going. The solution, which would be to provide the infantry with tracked or half-tracked armoured personnel carrier, was too expensive. After the disbanding of the Experimental Armoured Force, the British Army formed ad-hoc armoured forces in which the Tank brigades and Motorized Infantry brigades tended to operate independently of each other, a fault repeated in the early years of World War II.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Experimenter Publishing", "body": "thumbExperimenter Publishing was an American media company founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1915. The first magazine was The Electrical Experimenter (1913–1931) and the most notable magazines were Radio News (1919–1985) and Amazing Stories (1926–2005). Their radio station, WRNY, began broadcasting experimental television in 1928. In early 1929 the company was forced into bankruptcy and the Gernsback brothers lost control of Experimenter Publishing. The magazines did not miss an issue and were quickly sold to another publisher. The Gernsbacks promptly started new magazines to compete with their former ones.\\n\\nRadio News became Popular Electronics and the January 1975 issue featured the Altair 8800 computer on the cover; this launched the personal computer revolution. Hugo Gernsback's Amazing Stories is regarded as the first dedicated science fiction magazine and every year World Science Fiction Society gives the Hugo Awards for the best science fiction and fantasy works.\\n\\nthumbHugo Gernsback was born in Luxembourg in 1884 and he became fascinated with electricity as a boy. While studying electrical engineering at a Technikum University in Bingen, Germany; he built a simple radio transmitter and receiver. Gernsback also developed a powerful dry-cell battery but was unable to patent it in Europe. In February 1904 Gernsback emigrated to America hoping to sell his battery design to automobile companies and had modest success with this. Gernsback lived in a New York City boarding house where he met Lewis Coggeshall, a railroad telegraph operator. They found it difficult to purchase radio parts in New York City so in 1905 they decided to start the Electro Importing Company to sell radio components and electrical components by mail-order. An early product was a spark-gap telegraph transmitter with a one mile range that was first advertised in November 25, 1905 issue of Scientific American and sold for $8.50. The Electro Importing Company catalogs soon had 64 pages of products and detailed technical articles on how to use the components offered for sale. The catalog used the title \"Modern Electrics\" in 1908 before the magazine was launched. The catalog continued to grow and used various titles.Gernsback bought Coggeshall's share of the company in 1907. To expand Electro Importing, Gernsback ran a classified ad in the January 27, 1908 New York Times looking for a new investor.Milton Hymes answered and with the new capital, Electro Importing moved to a larger building on Fulton Street and later opened two retail stores. Modern Electrics was launched as a magazine in April 1908. The Electro Importing Catalogs continued independently. This is the magazine where Gernsback wrote his first science fiction story \"Ralph 124C 41+\" in April 1911. Gernsback wanted to start a second magazine, \"Electrical Experimenter\", so he sold Modern Electrics and the Modern Publishing Company to a business partner, Orland Ridenour. The last issue with Hugo Gernsback as editor was March 1913. The first issue of \"Electrical Experimenter\" was May 1913. Modern Publishing acquired Electrician and Mechanic and merged it with Modern Electrics in January 1914 to become Modern Electrics and Mechanics. After a series of mergers and title changes the magazine became Popular Science Monthly in October 1915 and is still published today.\\n\\nHugo Gernsback frequently formed new partnerships with investors for a new magazine or other opportunity (such as a radio station). The Experimenter Publishing Company was incorporated in March 1915. The corporate officers were Hugo Gernsback, his brother Sidney Gernsback and Milton Hymes. Hymes had worked with Gernsback since 1908 and was an officer in both the Electro Importing Company and the Experimenter Publishing Company. Hymes died in a railroad accident in 1917. Robert W. De Mott replaced Hymes as advertising manager and corporate Secretary.\\n\\nthumbElectrical Experimenter, introduced in May 1913, was initially published by the Electro Importing Company. The new Experimenter Publishing Company became the publisher with the May 1915 issue. The June 1918 cover had a sub-title of \"Science and Invention\", and the contents expanded to include general science, chemistry and mechanics. It continued to publish fiction stories. Science and Invention became the primary title in August 1920 and the last issue was in August 1931.\\n\\nExperimenter Publishing created a magazine devoted to radio in July 1919, Radio Amateur News. The title was shortened to Radio News in June 1920. The magazine was very successful. It appealed to amateur radio operators and to hobbyists wanting to listen to the new commercial radio stations. Radio News, under various titles, was published until 1985.\\n\\nThe articles in Radio News were technically sophisticated so a new magazine, Practical Electrics, was created to appeal to a wider audience. This was initially published by Practical Electrics Company, a subsidiary of Experimenter Publishing. The first issue was November 1921. The magazine never printed more than 60,000 copies; the old Electrical Experimenter had 100,000 readers and Radio News now had 400,000. In the November 1924 issue Hugo Gernsback wrote \"We therefore decided last month to bring back the old Electrical Experimenter once and for all.\"; the title became The Experimenter The magazine was merged into Science and Invention in February 1926.\\n\\nThe Consolidated Radio Call Book Company published blueprint and instructions for building radio equipment. These were sold to amateur radio operators and hobbyist by radio parts stores across the United States. Hugo Gernsback was President and R. W. DeMott was Secretary of this publicly traded company. The name was changed to the Consrad Company in June 1923. The Electro Importing Company was selling more books and fewer radio parts and transitioned into a publishing company. Consrad began distributing the E. I. Co. books to radio dealers.) The Radio Specialty Company, \"RASCO\", took over the parts business. In 1926 the Consrad started the Radio Listeners' Guide and Call Book, a quarterly magazine. Sidney Gernsback was the editor and his name appeared on the cover. A typical issue had 50 pages of radio station listing and 100 pages of detailed radio construction plans.\\n\\nthumbSidney Gernsback published a hard bound \"Radio Encyclopedia\" for that was independent of Experimenter Publishing or the Consrad Company. It claimed to cover every phase of radio with \"over 1930 separate definitions, 549 illustrations, a complete cross index, and many other special features.\" The Encyclopedia was not part of the bankruptcy.Hugo Gernsback also published magazines that appealed to a general audience. Motor Camper & Tourist was a travel guide for those that toured the United States by automobile. The July 1924 issue started a series about driving and camping across the country from New York City to San Francisco. Another was Your Body, a guide to the operation and mechanics of the human body. An advertisement for the magazine claimed that \"each issue is practically an endless source of information on sex, prevention and care of diseases, the senses and the normal functions of nature as related to our bodies.\" Time Magazine reviewed the first issue with an article titled \"Unsexing Sex\". Gernsback promoted it as a magazine for the whole family but Time felt the target audience was \"radio bugs\" (a 1920s term for geeks).<ref name Time Nov 22 1926\"></ref>\\n\\nHugo Gernsback had always published fiction stories in his magazines. He wanted stories that promoted imaginative uses of science and technology. This \"scientific fiction\" needed to be somewhat plausible. The August 1923 Science and Invention had an astronaut in a space suit on the cover and the issue was devoted to scientific fiction. Gernsback began developing a scientific fiction magazine and Amazing Stories was launched with the April 1926 issue.\\n\\nBy 1928, Experimenter Publishing and Consrad were publishing a wide selection of books. In addition the radio titles, there were general interest books like Houdini's Spirit Exposes, Beauty Secrets, and Popular Tricks. These were prominently advertised in their magazines.\\n\\nthumbKDKA in Pittsburgh was the first commercial radio station in the United States, having made their first broadcast in November 1920. By 1925 there were over 500 broadcast stations in the United States. KDKA was operated by Westinghouse Electric to help sell radio receivers. In addition to radio equipment manufacturers, many publishers were starting stations. Experimenter Publishing applied for and was granted a radio station license to transmit at 1160 kilocycles (kHz) with the call sign WRNY. (Over the next three years they would use 800 kHz, 1070 kHz, 970 kHz, 920 kHz and finally 1010 kHz.) The state of the art studio was in a room on the 18th floor of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City and the 500 watt transmitter located on the hotel roof. The first broadcast was on June 12, 1925 and was reported in the New York Times. The opening speaker was former Senator Chauncey Depew followed by the \"father of radio\", Lee De Forest. This was followed by live musical entertainment. The Times noted Hugo Gernsback's Staccatone signal generator that was used before the station signed on and signing the end of programs. The Staccatone was a primitive music synthesizer described in the March 1924 Practical Electrics magazine. Experimenter Publishing used the radio station and the magazines to promote each other. The station call letters, WRNY, appeared on each magazine cover.\\n\\nBy 1927 there were over fifty radio stations and 1.5 million radio sets in the New York metropolitan area. There were so many stations it was common for stations to share the same frequency at different times during the day. The Radio Act of 1912 did not mention broadcasting and it was not clear who controlled radio stations, the states or the federal government. Early radio receivers were not very selective and there were frequent disputes over interference between stations with adjacent frequencies. In November 1926, WRNY (800 kHz) moved its transmitter from the Roosevelt Hotel to Coytesville, New Jersey (directly across the river from Manhattan). Radio station WHN (830 kHz) claimed this blocked their signal and alleged WRNY was a \"pirate\" broadcaster. In 1927 the Federal Radio Commission was established with the authority to regulate broadcast stations.\\n\\nthumbHugo Gernsback first wrote about television in the December 1909 issue of Modern Electrics and had reported on the technical advances in his magazines. By 1925 mechanical scanning television systems were becoming available with resolutions of up to 60 scan lines. These mechanical systems were simple enough that a hobbyist could construct a television receiver. Vladimir K. Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth were developing electronic scanning systems that were the precursors of modern television. These would not be available for another decade.\\n\\nIn April 1928, Pilot Electric Manufacturing and WRNY announced that television broadcast would begin that fall. Pilot would provide the transmitting equipment. Pilot also sold the receivers but Experimenter Publishing magazines provided complete plans that allowed readers to build their own television. The system used by WRNY had 48 scan lines with 7.5 frames per second. The image was about 1.5 inches square. This low resolution picture (without sound) could be transmitted in the 5 kHz audio bandwidth of an AM radio station. (The NTSC 525 line standard definition television signal is allotted a 6 MHz bandwidth.) The first test broadcast was on August 12, 1928. Others had been transmitting television before this but WRNY was the first to have a regular scheduled program. Hugo Gernsback estimated that there were around 2000 television receivers in the New York area.\\n\\nBy 1927 the expenses exceeded the income of the Experimenter Publishing Company. The radio station had a stream of advertising revenue but there was the new transmitter facility in New Jersey plus the investment in television equipment. WRNY was losing around $50,000 a year by 1927. Hugo Gernsback received a salary of $50,000 per year; his brother Sidney received $39,000. As a comparison, the Governor of New York State earned $25,000 a year. In February 1927 the Experimenter Publishing Company leased the entire sixteenth floor of 230 Fifth Avenue to be used as executive offices. In an effort to boost the circulation, Hugo Gernsback announce in the April 1927 Radio News that the radio project blue prints that had been selling for one or two dollars were now free.\\n\\nThe largest expenses for a magazine publisher are paper and printing. The publisher has to print enough copies to supply every outlet. At the end of the month the distributor would return the unsold copies to the publisher for a credit. Experimenter Publishing had 4 or 5 monthly magazines so this was a considerable expense. By 1928 the creditors had installed resident accountants at Experimenter Publishing to review the expenditures.\\n\\nThe largest creditors were the paper supplier, Bulkley Dunton Co. ($154,406), Art Color Printing Co. of Dunellen, N.J. ($152,908) and Edward Langer Printing Co., ($14,614). On February 20, 1929 an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Experimenter Publishing Company on behalf of Daniel A. Walters ($2,030), Marie E. Bachmann ($2,094) and Robert Halper ($2,095). The fact that minor creditors forced the bankruptcy has nourished various conspiracy theories over the years. The total liabilities were estimated at $600,000 and assets at $182,000. Federal Judge Mack appointed the Irving Trust Company as the receiver. Hugo Gernsback spoke to the press afterward and said: \"Plans are being formulated to reorganize and continue publication as heretofore. I am authorized to say this by the receiver.\"\\n\\nThe April 1929 issues of Radio News (on the newsstand March 10), Amazing Stores and Science and Invention were the last to feature Hugo Gernsback as editor. The Irving Trust appointed publisher Bergan A. MacKinnon as circulation manager and Arthur Lynch as managing editor. The WRNY stayed on the air and the magazines did not miss an issue. The bankruptcy proceedings were enthusiastically covered in the news and gossip columns of the New York City press.\\n\\nThe creditors of Experimenter Publishing and the Consrad Company reviewed bids at a March 28 hearing before the bankruptcy referee. Two publishers, B. A. MacKinnon and Macfadden Publications, entered similar bids that would almost pay the creditors in full. After these two complete bids were read, Chester Cuthell then offered $60,000 for the radio stations. The MacKinnon offer was revised to allow the separate sale of the stations, Macfadden wanted to keep the stations. Motion Picture Publications offered $50,000 cash for Amazing Stories. Fawcett Publishing offered $30,000 cash for Science and Invention. The Robert McBride Company offered $300,000 for Science and Invention and Amazing Stories. The hearing was adjourned for a week to allow the creditor's committee to evaluate the bids.\\n\\nAt the April 3 hearing, Mr. MacKinnon agreed to pay $200,000 now and $300,000 more in September. Mr. Cuthell acting for the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company would pay the other $100,000 for the radio stations. After administration expenses, the creditors were paid 95 cents on the dollar. The attorneys handling receivership said this was the first time they had seen a forced sale pay off the creditors in full. The Irving Trust Company's decision to keep the magazines and stations running avoided an early sale at a sacrifice price. The first bid for complete company was $100,000. The first offer for the radio stations was only $7,500. Here is a New York Times account of the final bidding.\\n\\nthumbHugo and Sidney Gernsback were questioned at an April 19 hearing about the operation of the Experimenter Publishing and the Consrad Company. They were questioned by attorneys for the Irving Trust Company and B. A. MacKinnon \"to discover any assets which may have been concealed or diverted.\" Attorneys for Mr. MacKinnon, questioned the method of the bankrupt companies in allowing hotels space for advertising in the magazines published by the Gernsbacks for trade bills (vouchers) instead of cash. The Gernsbacks explained that the space assigned to the hotels was unsold at the press date and the ads were \"fillers.\" The trade bills were given to wholesalers, advertisers and others with whom they did business.\\n\\nHugo Gernsback was also asked about letters soliciting subscribers for his new company, Gernsback Publications, Inc. and if the subscription lists of the bankrupt firm had been used. \"Mr. Gernsback emphatically denied that such lists had been used.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Gernsback said after the hearing that his new magazines would be Radio Craft, Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories and that the first issues would be out in June.\"\\n\\nThe Experimenter Publishing bankruptcy made it to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1933. The state of New York missed the deadline for filing claims but still wanted the back taxes the Experimenter Publishing owed. The court ruled that the Constitution gave control of bankruptcy to the federal government and the states would have to follow the rules and procedures like any other creditor.\\n\\nGernsback was quickly able to raise capital for a new publishing company. The June issue of Science Wonder Stories was on the newsstand on May 3, 1929. This was one of two magazines Gernsback created to compete with Amazing Stories; his Air Wonder Stories appeared six weeks later. They were merged into Wonder Stories after a year. The July issues of Radio Craft appeared on the newsstand on June 5, 1929, three months after Gernsback lost Radio News. There was a new Everyday Science and Mechanics to compete with Science and Invention.\\n\\nHugo Gernsback often published articles about the history of his magazines, but the bankruptcy was always ignored. The April 1958 Radio-Electronics (formerly Radio Craft) has a 16 page story on Gernsback's 50 year publishing history. Here is the complete description of the bankruptcy: \"In the spring of 1929, Radio News, Science and Invention, Amazing Stories and associated magazines were sold to other interest. Radio News of April, 1929, was the last Gernsback issue.\"\\n\\nThe eve of the Great Depression was not an ideal time to start new magazines but Gernsback persevered. Radio Craft and successor titles were in print until January 2003. Gernsback decided to focus on radio magazines and added Short Wave Craft in June 1930 and Television News in 1931. Wonder Stories was sold to Thrilling Publications in 1936 and it was in print until 1955. Science and Mechanics was sold to Virgil Angerman in 1937 and it was in print until the 1970s (as late as May 1974).\\n\\nB. A. MacKinnon immediately renamed the company to Experimenter Publications and then to Radio-Science Publications in November 1930. MacKinnon's plan was to pay off the debt of acquiring the magazine with the revenue from the magazines. The Depression drove many advertisers out of business and made magazines a luxury for many readers. Radio-Science Publications ceased operations with the August 1931 issues. Bernarr Macfadden's newly formed Teck Publishing Corporation took over with the September 1931 issue. Radio News and Amazing Stories were continued but Science and Invention was sold and absorbed into Popular Mechanics magazine.\\n\\nRadio News and Amazing Stories were in poor financial health when Ziff-Davis acquired them in January 1938. They were listed as publisher in the March issues but the April issues were the first produced under their control. Radio News was published by Ziff-Davis under several titles until 1985. They published Amazing Stories until 1965 when it was sold to Ultimate Publishing.\\n\\nImmediately after the bankruptcy auction, the Aviation Radio Station, Inc. was formed to take over the WRNY radio stations. C. M. Keys, president of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, provided the financial backing for the new company. Chester Cuthell, the attorney who was at the auction, was the president and Walter Lemmon was the general manager. The goal of the station was to promote aviation. The Federal Radio Commission had to approve station license transfer and any changes to the station. Mr. Cuthell asked the commission for more frequencies as he said that he and his partners had up to $2,000,000 dollars to spend on the stations. The commission approved the license transfers and improvements to the existing stations.\\n\\nIn August 1929 Aviation Radio moved the studios from the Roosevelt Hotel to 27 West Fifty-Seventh Street. They also installed a new 1000 watt transmitter with automatic frequency control and new speech amplifiers at their plant in Coytesville NJ. These upgrades improved the range and sound quality of their broadcast. The short wave station, 2XLA, increased is power to 15,000 watts.The radio stations format was changed; the Jazz music was prohibited and replaced with presentations devoted to aviation and aviators. On a show about women aviators, Amelia Earhart recounted her recent transcontinental flight. The station gave hourly weather reports of aviators.\\n\\nAfter 1928 WRNY was at 1010 kilocycles (kHz) and shared the frequency with 3 other stations. This is a typical broadcast schedule: WRNY started at 10:00 AM, WHN followed at 1:30 PM, WPAP followed at 7:00 PM, and finally WRNY closed out the broadcast day from 9:30 PM to midnight. WQAO, own by the Calvary Baptist Church, broadcast three programs on Sunday and one on Wednesday. The owner of WHN, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, bought the other stations in 1933 and WHN used 1010 kHz full time starting in January 1934 . The stations call letters were later changed to WMGM; the station is today's WFAN, while WEPN replaced it on the frequency.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Explosion welding", "body": "thumbExplosion welding (EXW) is a solid state process where welding is accomplished by accelerating one of the components at extremely high velocity through the use of chemical explosives. This process is most commonly utilized to clad carbon steel plate with a thin layer of corrosion resistant material (e.g., stainless steel, nickel alloy, titanium, or zirconium). Due to the nature of this process, producible geometries are very limited. They must be simple. Typical geometries produced include plates and tubing.\\n\\nUnlike other forms of welding such as arc welding (which was developed in the early 19th century), explosion welding was developed relatively recently, in the decades after World War II. Its origins, however, go back to World War I, when it was observed that pieces of shrapnel sticking to armor plating were not only embedding themselves, but were actually being welded to the metal. Since the extreme heat involved in other forms of welding did not play a role, it was concluded that the phenomenon was caused by the explosive forces acting on the shrapnel. These results were later duplicated in laboratory tests and, not long afterwards, the process was patented and put to use.\\n\\nIn 1962, DuPont applied for a patent on the explosion welding process, which was granted in 1964 and resulted in the use of the Detaclad trademark to describe the process. On July 22, 1996, Dynamic Materials Corporation completed the acquisition of DuPont's Detaclad operations for a purchase price of $5,321,850.\\n\\nExplosion welding can produce a bond between two metals that cannot necessarily be welded by conventional means. The process does not melt either metal, instead it plasticizes the surfaces of both metals, causing them to come into intimate contact sufficient to create a weld. This is a similar principle to other non-fusion welding techniques, such as friction welding. Large areas can be bonded extremely quickly and the weld itself is very clean, due to the fact that the surface material of both metals is violently expelled during the reaction.\\n\\nA major disadvantage of this method is that an expansive knowledge of explosives is needed before the procedure may be attempted. Explosion welding is therefore far less commonly used than fusion welding alternatives.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Export Control Act", "body": "The Export Control Act of 1940 was one in a series of legislative efforts by the United States government and initially the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to accomplish two tasks: to avoid scarcity of critical commodities in a likely pre-war environment and, more notably, to limit the exportation of materiel to pre-World War II Imperial Japan. The act originated as a presidential proclamation by Roosevelt forbidding the exporting of aircraft parts, chemicals, and minerals without a license, and was intended to induce Japan to curtail its occupation of the Indo-Chinese coast.\\n\\nThe text of the Act stated that whenever the President deemed it \"necessary in the interest of national defense,\" he could prohibit or curtail the exportation of military equipment, munitions, tools and materials.\\n\\nAlthough controls were first authorized in 1940 in regard to munitions and similar materials essential to the defense effort, its coverage was extended in 1942 to all commodities, and broader geographic coverage, following America's entry into WWII. The law was extended, with modifications through 1948, and it was envisioned that remaining controls would soon disappear at the time of re-enactment in 1949. The scarcity of certain goods in the world markets however, made continuance of controls necessary in order to prevent a drain on such goods from plentiful American supplies with its consequential inflationary effects. National security and foreign policy concerns, especially following the outbreak of the Korean War, were new and compelling reasons for passing the Export Control Act of 1949, and in extending it until (at least) 1958. The law included both domestic policies aimed primarily at conditions within the United States, as well as controls directed at conditions outside the country, as an instrument of American foreign policy. This is exemplified by the restrictions on export of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the US during the Cold War. The foreign policy motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the Soviet block to parallel those of the United States. The benefits of the various economic and military aid programs were to be withheld from non-cooperating nations, as in the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951.\\n\\nThe Act was seen as a codified \"moral embargo\", in that it was an expression of moral outrage, in this instance, stemming from the Japanese bombing of civilians in mainland China in the late 1930s. In June 1938, the U.S. Secretary of State, Cordell Hull on June, 1938 condemned the slaughter and its \"material encouragement\". A month later, the Department of State notified aircraft manufacturers and exporters that the United States Government was \"strongly opposed\" to the sale of airplanes and related materiel to those nations using airplanes to attack civilian populations.\\n\\nIn 1939, the non-binding embargo was extended to materials essential to airplane manufacture and to plans, plants, and technical information for the production of high-quality aviation gasoline. These measures resulted in the suspension of the export to Japan of aircraft, aeronautical equipment, and other materials within the scope of the moral embargoes. As Japanese purchases of items other than aircraft and aeronautical equipment were minuscule, the moral embargo ultimately stopped the exportation of arms to Japan.\\n\\nFollowing the failure of diplomatic efforts to protect endangered American lives, rights and economic interests in China, America considered commercial retaliation against Japan. by Japanese authorities or Japanese-sponsored agents in China. The American government felt that its 1911 commercial treaty with Japan was not affording an appropriate level of protection to U.S. commerce in areas within or occupied by Japan. Simultaneously, Japan's position under the treaty as a most favoured nation legally prevented the adoption of retaliatory measures against Japanese commerce. When the United States gave six-month notice of its withdrawal from the treaty in July, 1939, it removed the primary legal obstacle for embargo.\\n\\nThe embargo, which halted the shipment of material such as airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline, was designed to be an unfriendly act, but expanding it to include oil was specifically avoided. Japan was dependent on U.S. oil, and it was thought at the time that such would be a provocative step.\\n\\nThe Act was expanded in September of that year to include iron and steel scrap, an act that Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi warned Secretary Hull on October 8, 1940 might be considered an \"unfriendly act\".\\n\\nControls were first authorized in 1940 in regard to munitions and similar materials essential to the defense effort, and extended in 1942 to all commodities. Always intended to be only temporary, the 1940 act was successfully extended in 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1947.\\n\\nThe United States was not alone in its concern. Great Britain, which maintained colonies in the Far East also feared an aggressive Japan. Immediately following the enactment of the Act, the British ambassador would be asked by Japan to close the Burma Road, a key supply route of arms for China. Britain initially refused the request, but for a short period of time closed the road. The British and the Dutch followed suit in embargoing trade to Japan from their colonies in southeast Asia.\\n\\nThe ending of the commercial trade treaties further eroded the possibilities for dialogue between the two nations. Noted political economist Robert Higgs points out:\\n\\nRobert Stinnett notes in his book, Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor, that America had broken the Japanese diplomatic code and knew that due to the pressure exerted by the Export Control Act, war was quickly becoming an inevitable outcome. He points to a deciphered communiqué between Foreign Minister Teijiro Toyoda and Ambassador Kichisaburō Nomura on July 31: “Commercial and economic relations between Japan and third countries, led by England and the United States, are gradually becoming so horribly strained that we cannot endure it much longer. Consequently, our Empire, to save its very life, must take measures to secure the raw materials of the South Seas.”\\n\\nAfter WWII, the Export Control Act was expanded to prevent the diversion of advanced technology to the Soviet bloc and China and, in later years, to alter the behavior of foreign countries. Scarcity of certain goods in the world markets made continuance of controls necessary in order to prevent a drain on such goods from plentiful American supplies, with its consequential inflationary influence. It was envisioned that remaining controls would soon disappear at the time of re-enactment in 1949, but national security and foreign policy, especially following the outbreak of the Korean War, were new and compelling reasons for extending the Export Control Act of 1949 in 1951, 1953, 1956 and again in 1958. The Export Control Act of 1949 is an example of the type of legislation that it renders, subject to the regulations promulgated under it, all persons wherever situated. Under its provisions exports of scarce materials are controlled both from an economic standpoint--short supply and consequent inflationary effect on foreign demand; and the security standpoint-- autarchy and self-sufficiency in strategic resources not available in sufficiently large quantities. These are both domestic policies aimed primarily at conditions within the United States, but controls are also directed at conditions outside the country as an instrument of foreign policy. This is exemplified by the restrictions on export of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the US. This latter motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the Soviet block to parallel those of the United States. The benefits of the various economic and military aid programs were to be withheld from non-cooperating nations.\\n\\nWorld War II, Causes of\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)", "body": "Exposition Park (sometimes called Exposition Park III) was a baseball park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1890 to circa 1915. It was located on the north side of the Allegheny River across from Pittsburgh's downtown area. Prior to the construction of this version of Exposition Park, two previous ballparks of the same name were similarly situated along the Allegheny. Due to flooding from the nearby river, the three stadiums' exact locations varied somewhat. The final version of the ballpark was between the eventual sites of Three Rivers Stadium and PNC Park, somewhat closer to the Three Rivers site.\\n\\nBuilt for use of the Pittsburgh Burghers of the Players' League, the third incarnation of Exposition Park was the second home of the Pittsburg Pirates (during those years the team and the city were known as Pittsburg, with no \"H\"), the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. The Pirates played home games at the stadium from 1891 to 1909, when they moved to Forbes Field. In 1903, Exposition Park was the first National League ballpark to host a World Series game. The Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP)—known today as the University of Pittsburgh—played home football games at Exposition Park, and also used the park as a home field for the university's baseball team.\\n\\nThe first stadium known as Exposition Park was built in Allegheny, Pennsylvania—which was annexed by the city of Pittsburgh and later became known as the North Side—along the Allegheny River. Named for other \"expositions\" that would be shown there, including horse racing and circus, it was the first venue in Pittsburgh that hosted baseball. In 1882, the Pittsburgh Pirates—then known simply as Allegheny, or informally as \"the Alleghenys\"—began play at Exposition Park, however, after one season a fire and flooding of the field from the nearby River forced a second park to be built. Despite its reason for construction Exposition Park II was built closer to the River. The Alleghenys played at the second incarnation of the park until they moved to Recreation Park in 1884, which was several blocks north and out of the flood plain.\\n\\nthumbWhile the Pittsburgh Pirates were playing home games at Recreation Park, owners John Beemer and M. B. Lennon of the Pittsburgh Burghers constructed a baseball park near the former site of Exposition Park I and II—approximately two blocks west of the current PNC Park. The stadium included a roofed wooden grandstand around the infield, and open bleacher sections extending to the right and left field corners. Total capacity was about 10,000 spectators. The seats faced the Allegheny River and the Point. The Burghers played at the stadium during the 1890 Players' League season—the team and league's only season in existence. The Pirates moved to Exposition Park the following season. In 1906, the Pirates were the first baseball team to cover their field with a tarp during inclement weather, and though the field was kept dry from the rain, the Allegheny River still caused problems. Flooding sometimes covered the entire outfield with inches of standing water, causing ground rules that gave any ground ball hit into the outfield an automatic single. Exposition Park was  to the center field fence and  in left and right field. Ham Hyatt is believed to be the only person to hit a ball over the right field fence. Monument Hill, which overlooked the field, allowed spectators a free view of the game. In 1908, due to the large amounts of people that attended Pirates's games, team owner Barney Dreyfuss began looking for a location to construct a new Pirates stadium. The Pirates's final game at the stadium was played in 1909, the Pirates defeated the Cubs who they played the following day to open up Forbes Field. In 1914, the Pittsburgh Rebels began play at Exposition Park. In 1915, the Rebels—despite improving from the previous season—disbanded due to financial loss (as did the entire Federal League). Exposition Park continued to host Semi-professional baseball games, as well as other events, but \"was eventually razed\".\\n\\nAfter parts of 62 seasons in the Oakland district, baseball and football returned to the north side of the Allegheny River when Three Rivers Stadium opened. The site of the final incarnation of Exposition Park, relative to Three Rivers and the later PNC Park, was in between the two venues. Exposition Park had been on the southwest corner of South Avenue (later Robinson) to the north (first base) and School Street (later Scotland) to the east (third base). To the south (left field) was some open space and railroad tracks and the Allegheny. To the west (right field) was some open space and then Grant Street (later Galveston). That open space would eventually be the site of Three Rivers. To put it another way, the site of Exposition Park was the northeast corner of the parking lot east of Three Rivers.\\n\\nIn 1995, members of the Society for American Baseball Research placed a plaque where home plate is believed to have been located, in honor of one of the two sites of the first World Series (the other being in Boston). In 1998, a Pennsylvania Historical marker was placed at the site of the park.\\n\\nthumbOn June 10, 1890, Jocko Fields of the Pittsburgh Burghers hit the first home run at Exposition Park. On April 24, 1891, Fred Carroll hit the first home run by a Pirate in the stadium. Under the management of Fred Clarke the Pirates won the National League pennant in 1901, 1902, and 1903. After the 1903 season, Dreyfuss and Boston Pilgrims's owner Henry Killilea organized a best of nine game series to match the two pennant winners against each other. The first World Series held three games in Boston before moving to Exposition Park with the Pirates leading the series 2–1. On October 6, 1903, 7,600 people attended the first World Series game in a National League stadium—the Pirates won by one run. The following day 12,000 people attended the game, forcing some spectators to stand behind a rope in the outfield. The Pirates lost three of four games at Exposition Park and eventually the Series. In 1907, Pittsburg's pitcher Nick Maddox threw a no-hitter at Exposition Park. The final Pirates's game at Exposition Park was played against the Chicago Cubs on June 24, 1909. The Pirates won the game 8–1 in front of 5,545 people, with George Gibson achieving the final National League hit in the ballpark.\\n\\nrightThe Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP), which would later be known as the University of Pittsburgh, played its first official game at Exposition Park on October 11, 1890 when Shadyside Academy failed to show up for their game with the Allegheny Athletic Association. The Allegheny A.A. made a call to WUP team founder Bert Smyers to bring the WUP team to the park as a replacement. The WUP team was subsequently defeated 38-0. The WUP football team began playing games more regularly at Exposition Park around 1900, occasionally playing in other local venues. Prior to the 1903 season, Arthur Mosse was recruited from the University of Kansas to become the team's new coach. In addition to players that Mosse brought with him, WUP also recruited players from Geneva College to play on the team. Mosse's first season was a disappointment as the WUP football team went 0–8–1 and supporters of the team disbanded leaving the team $500 in debt. George Hubbard Clapp then organized a voluntary $5 \"athletic fee\" to be paid by students in order to allow the debt to be repaid and the school's football team to play home games at Exposition Park during the next season in order to give the WUP team a more permanent and stable home. Mosse and university officials then obtained a lease to play at Exposition Park during the fall from Pirates's owner Barney Dreyfuss for 20% of the admission fee. The 1904 WUP team, the first full season in which WUP played at Exposition Park, saw WUP achieve a remarkable turnaround that included a 10–0 record in which they outscored opponents 407 to 5 and finished second in the state behind the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to home games at Exposition Park, WUP students would organize parades through downtown streets prior to marching across a bridge to the game. A gong, used to announce the beginning of Pirate games, was also sounded prior to the opening kickoff of WUP football contests.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Extra moenia", "body": "Extra moenia is a Latin phrase that means outside the walls or outside the walls of the city.\\n\\nThe phrase is commonly used in reference to the original attributes of a building, usually a church, where it was built outside the original city walls. Hence, when a city expands over time, a church which was originally outside the walls might end up in the center of the larger city; subsequently, to retain the original architectural context, it would be referred to as extra moenia. Two examples of this are the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome, and San Gennaro extra Moenia of Naples.\\n\\nThe term is also used to indicate an occurrence or activity taking place outside the venue where it would normally be used or reside.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Extraocular implant", "body": "An extraocular implant (also known as eyeball jewelry) is a cosmetic implant involving a tiny piece of decorative jewelry which is implanted within the superficial, interpalpebral conjunctiva of the human eye.\\n\\nEyeball jewelry was developed first in the Netherlands as a radical new form of body modification in 2002. The cosmetic extraocular implant (CEI) was first designed at the Netherlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery and is marketed there under the name JewelEye. The procedure is completely legal in the Netherlands, as long as it is performed by a licensed ophthalmologist under sterile conditions. The current cost is approximately €750 . \\n\\nIts legality outside of the Netherlands is currently untested. However, several jurisdictions in the US have already supported bills to ban the procedure even though it hasn’t become available in the US yet. On March 6, 2005, an Illinois state committee approved a bill banning the procedure. Infraction could result in a penalty of up to three years in prison.\\n\\nUnlike subdermal implant and other new body modification procedures, the extraocular implant is currently only being performed in a medical clinic environment. The procedure is relatively quick, but it does require that both eyes be immobilized with anesthetic drops, and that the layers of the eyeball where the implant is situated must be separated by the injection of liquid. As very few people have undergone this procedure, and it is relatively new, the long term health effects are currently unknown.\\n\\nHowever, the Website of the Netherlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery states that the implant does not interfere with the ocular functions, i.e. the visual performance and mobility. As well, patient satisfaction remains high and no side effects of the treatment have been noticed with a follow-up of more than one year.\\n\\nCurrently, the only supplier of jewelry for this implant is Hippocratech b.v., a company in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The implant is manufactured from a platinum alloy and is available in several basic shapes, including the Euro sign, heart, music note, clover or star shapes, with other shapes custom made by the company upon request. The size of the jewellery is about 1/8\" (3 mm) across.\\n\\n"}

It was first published in the U.S. in the 15 September 1915 issue of The Saturday Evening Post, and in the UK in the January 1916 edition of the Strand Magazine. It was included in the collection The Man with Two Left Feet (1917).\\n\\n\"Extricating Young Gussie\" features the first appearance of some of Wodehouse's most popular and enduring characters - valet extraordinaire Jeeves (whose role in this debut story is very small) and his master Bertie Wooster (whose surname is not actually mentioned). Bertie's imperious Aunt Agatha also appears.\\n\\nThe first meeting of Jeeves and Bertie would be chronicled one year later, in the November 1916 short story \"Jeeves Takes Charge\".\\n\\nAunt Agatha drags Bertie out of bed \"in the small hours [around] half past eleven\". She is most distressed that her nephew, and Bertie's cousin Gussie Mannering-Phipps \"has lost his head over a creature\", a chorus-girl in New York that he may marry, so she demands that Bertie head over there and stop him.\\n\\nArriving at Gussie's New York hotel, Bertie is surprised to find no sign of his cousin. Out in the bustling street he runs into Gussie, now going by the name of \"George Wilson\", who is about to appear on the music-hall stage in order to please his girl's ex-pro father. Bertie, worried by this, telegraphs his Aunt Julia for help.\\n\\nAfter some rehearsals, Gussie's first show rolls round, and Bertie finds himself sat next to a very pretty girl. Gussie has stage-fright and starts badly, but halfway through his second song the girl beside Bertie joins in, bucking Gussie up and getting a big round from the audience. It turns out she is the girl Gussie loves.\\n\\nAunt Julia arrives, and Bertie takes her to see Gussie and his girl in their respective shows. They then pay a call on the girl's father, Mr Joe Danby, who turns out to have known and loved Julia in her music-hall days. Julia tells him her son has inherited her talent; he demands she stay with him where she belongs.\\n\\nMeeting Gussie soon after, Bertie hears Julia and Danby are to be married, as are Gussie and Danby's daughter. Receiving a telegram from Aunt Agatha asking if she should come and help, Bertie puts her off, and resolves to avoid England for some time, \"about ten years.\"\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Exuperius", "body": "Saint Exuperius (also Exsuperius) () (died c. 410) was Bishop of Toulouse at the beginning of the 5th century.\\n\\nHis place and date of birth are unknown. Upon succeeding Saint Sylvius as bishop of Toulouse, he completed the Basilica of St. Sernin, begun by his predecessor. Saint Jerome praises him for his munificence to the monks of Palestine, Egypt, and Libya, and for his charity to the people of his own diocese, who were then suffering from the attacks of the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi. For the sake of the poor in his diocese he even sold the altar vessels and so was compelled to carry the Sacred Offering in an osier basket and the Precious Blood in a vessel of glass. In esteem for his virtues and in gratitude for his gifts, Saint Jerome dedicated to him his Commentary on Zacharias.\\n\\nExuperius is best known in connection with the Canon of the Sacred Scriptures. He had written to Innocent I for instructions concerning the canon and several points of ecclesiastical discipline. In reply, the pope honoured him with the letter Consulenti tibi, dated February 405, which contained a list of the canonical scriptures as they are today.\\n\\nThe opinion of Baronius, that the bishop Exuperius was identical with the rector of the same name, is quite generally rejected, as the rector was a teacher of Hannibalianus and Dalmatius, nephews of Constantine the Great, over a half a century before the period of the bishop. From Jerome's letter to Furia, in 394, and from the epistle of Saint Paulinus to Amandus of Bordeaux, in 397, it seems probable that Exuperius was a priest at Rome, and later at Bordeaux, before he was raised to the episcopate, though it is possible that in both of these letters reference is made to a different person. Just when he became bishop is unknown. That he occupied the See of Toulouse in February 405, (as is evident from the letter of Innocent I mentioned above) and from a statement of Saint Jerome in a letter to Rusticus it is certain that he was still living in 411. It is sometimes said that Jerome reproved him, in a letter to Riparius, a priest of Spain, for tolerating the heretic Vigilantius; but as Vigilantius did not belong to the diocese of Toulouse, Jerome was probably speaking of another bishop.\\n\\nExuperius was early venerated as a saint. Even in the time of Gregory of Tours he was held in equal veneration with Saint Saturninus. His feast occurs on 28 September. The first martyrologist to assign it to this date was Usuard, who wrote towards the end of the 9th century.\\n\\n"}

His power was increased due to the liberal grant of lands in Thuringia and Franconia which his wife received out of Ottonian possessions. Candidate to the imperial throne at the death of Otto III, he received huge territories (Kaiserswerth, Duisburg, and Saalfeld) for renouncing to the throne, making him the most powerful man in the empire after the emperor. Otto's successor, Emperor Henry II, was less friendly towards the powerful count, although there was no serious trouble between them until 1011. Some disturbances in Lotharingia quickly forced the emperor to come to terms, and Ezzo's assistance was purchased with additional imperial fiefs.\\n\\nAfter this, the relations between Henry and his vassal appear to have been satisfactory.

It was a segment of the original M-10 that was replaced by US 23 in 1926. Later changes to US 23 created two different routings of M-171, the second of which has been designated F-41 since 1970.\\n\\nF-41 begins at an intersection with US Highway 23 (US 23) on the north side of Oscoda. The route then travels to the northwest away from town, passing between Van Etten Lake and what was previously Wurtsmith Air Force Base. The route continues north through a rural area of Alcona County and passes through the small communities of Mikado and Gustin before coming to a junction with M-72. After crossing M-72, F-41 turns east into the community of Lincoln, Michigan along Traverse Bay State Road, 2nd Street and Main Street, then leaves town to the north. The road continues on to the north through Alcona County before terminating at a second junction with US 23. The highway travels though wooded terrain along its routing.\\n\\nThe first highway designation to run from Oscoda toward Spruce to Alpena was the original M-10 on July 1, 1919. This segment of highway was later redesignated as a part of US 23 in 1926 when the United States Numbered Highway System was established. Realignments of US 23 spawned both versions of M-171.\\n\\nThe initial incarnation of M-171 served as a loop route off US 23 which departed the main highway east of Spruce, traveled west through Spruce, then north past Hubbard Lake and through Wilson before returning to US 23 near Alpena. This roadway was part of US 23 before it was redesignated M-171 in 1932. This routing is now occupied by the present day routings of Spruce, Hubbard Lake and Wilson roads. This version of M-171 was removed from service in 1934.\\n\\nThe second version of M-171 ran between Oscoda and  was assumed into the state trunkline system in 1936. The was another former segment of US 23. It served that route for 24 years before being decommissioned in late 1960 or early 1961. The routing was then assigned County Route F-41 after October 5, 1970, and has retained that designation ever since. Prior to taking this designation, the route as known as Old M-171 in Iosco County and presently has no other name besides F-41. The routing within Alcona County is known as Somers Road or Mikado Road from the Alcona county line to the village of Lincoln; Traverse Bay State Road, Second Street and Main Street within the village of Lincoln; and Barlow Road from the eastern Lincoln village limits northerly.\\n\\nF41171\\n\\n"}

Nitra were promoted and relegated 4 times from the Czechoslovakian league with their longest stay being 5 years (1979–1984, 1986–1991). Nitra came close to clinching the title in 1962 only to lose out by 3 points to Dukla Prague. FC Nitra was the first football professional club in the former Czechoslovakia.\\n\\nNitra was involved in the inaugural Slovakian championship in 1994 but was relegated to the second division after their first season. The following season they were promoted back to the first division, only for the same fate to occur and were again relegated. Roller coaster seasons became somewhat of an FC Nitra speciality during the early 90's, until the promotions stopped in 2001 where fans had to wait five long seasons before seeing their club again return to the top flight where they finished with a respectable fifth place. This was mainly due to the work of headcoach Ivan Galád, who took control of the team in the winter of 2004, guiding the team to a fourth place finish in the second division.\\n\\nRóbert Rák became the top goal scorer both in the second division in the 2004/2005 season and (together with Erik Jendrišek) in the first division in the 2005/2006 season. In the beginning of the next season he was transferred to MFK Ružomberok. Galád coached the team very defensively (as according to his words no good striker was in the team). Galád lost his job after not much good results of the team at the end of 2006/2007 season (many losses and draws). The former Czech player Pavel Hapal was named as the head coach of the team for the 2007/2008 season. His way of coaching brought almost immediately very good results and the team finished 3rd (the best in the history of the club). After the season Hapal decided to leave the club to accept an offer from the top Czech club FK Mladá Boleslav. Pavel Malura, another coach from the Czech Republic, has taken the job.

The band was started as a side project by Thousand Foot Krutch frontman Trevor McNevan, and drummer Steve Augustine. The original lineup included John Bunner on guitar and Justin Smith on bass.\\n\\nTheir first album What Are You Waiting For? was produced by Aaron Sprinkle, who also produced Thousand Foot Krutch's album Phenomenon. The album featured the hit singles \"Definitely Maybe\", \"Something to Believe In\", and \"Crazy Mary\". FM Static toured through 2003 to 2005, John Bunner quickly retired after playing a few shows and so Justin asked his brother Jeremy to fill in for them.\\n\\nOn August 1, 2006, FM Static released their second album titled Critically Ashamed, which featured the single \"Waste of Time\". Originally, a cover of Vanilla Ice's \"Ice Ice Baby\" was to be included on this album, but it was removed later in the production process. The band did not tour in support of their second album because the Smith brothers had stopped playing for them. So FM Static became a two-piece band with studio musicians filling in for the other parts. While their second album featured only the single \"Waste of Time\", the songs \"Tonight\" and \"Moment of Truth\" went on to become huge unadvertised Internet hits, as well as hits on some radio stations. The song \"Tonight\" had accumulated over ten million hits on YouTube as of August 2010, while \"Moment of Truth\" had nearly seven million. \\n\\nOn April 7, 2009, FM Static released their third studio album Dear Diary. Written as a concept album, it details the fictional story of a boy facing the difficulties of life, love and faith, as told through his diary entries. The entries themselves were released in a blog prior to the album's release, and are included in the CD booklet, accompanied by illustrations drawn by Worth Dying For guitarist Nathan Parrish. This album featured the singles \"Boy Moves to a New Town With An Optimistic Outlook\", \"The Unavoidable Battle of Feeling On the Outside\", and \"Take Me As I Am\". Trevor announced in a TFK broadcast that FM Static plans to tour again in 2009 to promote the album. This was confirmed when FM Static was added to setlist of the Creation Festival tour alongside TFK as well as Jars of Clay, AA Talks, B.Reith and This Beautiful Republic. Due to the fact the Trevor and Steve could not play all instrumentals, Nick Baumhardt from TFK filled in on the tour, as well as Tom Beaupre on Bass and Keyboards.\\n\\nMcNevan also posted on his Twitter account on February 5, 2010, that he is in the process of finishing new songs for FM Static, which will appear on a new record. He stated originally that the album's title would be \"4\", but he later mentioned on his personal Facebook page that the title has been changed to \"My Brain Says STOP, but My Heart Says GO\". It has been confirmed on jesusfreakhideout that the album will be released sometime in 2011. At Lifest 2010 FM Static debuted a song for this album called \"Cinnamon & Lipstick\" .

It's more of a recognition that the different types exist than an attempt to define a single \"standard\".\\n\\nThe Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore) standard is used in the United States, Canada (but see below), Australia, China, Hong Kong and Singapore. It sends the data after the first ring tone and uses the 1200 baud Bell 202 tone modulation. The data may be sent in SDMF – which includes the date, time and number – or in MDMF, which adds a NAME field.\\n\\nBritish Telecom (BT) in the United Kingdom developed their own standard, which wakes up the display with a line reversal, then sends the data as CCITT v.23 modem tones in a format similar to MDMF. It is used by BT, wireless networks like the late Ionica, and some cable companies. Details are to be found in BT Supplier Information Note (SINs) 227 and 242; another useful document is Designing Caller Identification Delivery Using XR-2211 for BT from the EXAR website.\\n\\nThe Cable Communications Association (CCA) of the United Kingdom developed their own standard which sends the data after a short first ring, as either Bell 202 or v.23 tones. They developed a new standard rather than change some \"street boxes\" (multiplexors) which couldn't cope with the BT standard. The UK cable industry use a variety of switches: most are Nortel DMS-100; some are System X; System Y; and Nokia DX220. Note that some of these use the BT standard instead of the CCA one. The data format is similar to the BT one, but the transport layer is more like Telcordia Technologies, so North America or European equipment is more likely to detect it.\\n\\n"}

It stars Robert Carlyle and Ray Winstone and features the acting debut of rock singer Damon Albarn.\\n\\nFive men, criminals Ray, Dave, Stevie, Julian (\"Julie\" as a nickname), and Jason, plan a heist to steal a minimum of £3 million. Using a truck modified as a battering ram, the group break into a security depot in London and steal a large amount of money before the police arrive. However, they discover they barely got the amount of money they wanted, and only £65,000 to each man. Julian demands an extra amount of money as \"expenses\" for his work, but is beaten and placed in the boot of Ray's car until he just accepts his share. The group, without Julian, later spend time at a bar with fellow criminal Sonny, and Ray's girlfriend Connie, a protestor. Ray and Stevie also visit an elderly couple, Linda and Bill, where they leave their stolen money for safekeeping.\\n\\nThe next day, Ray and Stevie, who live together with Connie, are alerted by a bruised Dave that his money was stolen, apparently by Julian. Ray, Dave and Stevie investigate Linda and Bill's home to find them murdered and the money stolen, leaving Ray emotionally distraught. He visits Julian but his money is missing too. They conclude that Sonny stole the money and break into his house, only to find Jason dead with a headwound. The four are alerted to a pair of undercover police officers and flee, Dave and Julian engaging in a shootout with the police. Believing that he may be arrested for murder, Ray decides to flee after the money is found, and goes to his mother and Connie for help. His mother gives him some money and her car to use, disappointed in her son's career but still caring for him. Ray then speaks with Connie and asks her to come with him, and to meet her at a roadside service station on the M1 if she decides to come.\\n\\nRay visits the bar and learns from John the bartender that Dave left in a taxi with Jason and Sonny after the heist. Dave is beaten and interrogated by Ray, Stevie and Julian, revealing he was being blackmail by his daughter's boyfriend Chris, a corrupted police officer, to gain him the money to protect his daughter from harm. Dave also murdered Linda, Bill, Jason and Sonny. The group attack Chris in his apartment, and he is forced to reveal that the money is in a locker room at a local police station. Dave is taken upstairs by the rest of the gang where upon he sees a tray of prepared cocaine, enraging Dave to the point that he chokes Chris to death. Stevie and Julian remove Sarah, and Ray shoots Dave for his treachery and his murders. \\n\\nRay, Stevie and Julian sneak into the police station and gain the money, but Julian turns on the other two and gains all the money. However, an alarm goes off, prompting Julian to go on a shooting frenzy and makes a one man stand against all of the police in the building whilst Ray and Stevie, who is shot in the leg during the madness, escape safely with Julian's fate assumed to be being arrested after being knocked out with a knock-out gas bomb.

{"title": "Facial symmetry", "body": "Facial symmetry, is one element of bodily symmetry, including fluctuating asymmetry. Along with traits such as averageness and youthfulness it influences judgements of aesthetic traits of physical attractiveness and beauty , and is associated with fitness-linked traits including health, It is also hypothesized as a factor in both interpersonal attraction and interpersonal chemistry. \\n\\nEdler  cited research supporting the claim that bilateral symmetry is an important indicator of freedom from disease, and worthiness for mating. Facial asymmetries and minor physical anomalies begin to appear early in embryo development, mainly the first trimester of pregnancy, and can be a sign of instability during this growth. Fluctuating asymmetry (random differences between two sides, as opposed to the deliberate natural asymmetry in some animals) develop throughout the lifespan of the individual and is a sign of the phenotype being subjected to some levels of stress.\\n\\nThe ability to cope with these pressures is partly reflected in the levels of symmetry. A higher degree of symmetry indicates a better coping system for environmental factors. While the visible signs of this may not be particularly apparent, it is thought that they have at least a subconscious effect on people's perception of their beauty. Zaidel et al. in an empirical study upholds the claim that facial symmetry may be critical for the appearance of health. Their study disputes, however, the beauty or attractiveness claim.\\n\\nFacial symmetry is neither the only trait nor is it necessarily the most important trait of what a culture considers attractive. A competing aesthetic theory is wabi sabi. Characteristics of the wabi-sabi aesthetic include asymmetry, asperity, simplicity, modesty, intimacy, and suggest a natural process. Both symmetry and asymmetry may have aesthetic appeal that also play a role in art. The asymmetry which does not mean the conjunction of two parts that are completely unalike and unrelated to each other but the conjunction of similar and related parts that are to some extent contrasted to one another is considered to have the most aesthetic appeal.\\n\\nSuzi Malin, a British portrait painter, wrote Love at First Sight (ISBN 0-7566-0401-X) to examine the relationships of 50 celebrity couples. She speculates that there are three aspects of facial symmetry which attract one person to another: echoism, harmonism and prima copulism. Echoism is the similarity of one or more facial features, particularly the eye, eyebrow, nose and mouth. Harmonism is a similarity in facial proportions, usually involving the features and the distance between them. Prima copulism is an attraction to another person based on them having similar features to someone with whom they formed a strong interpersonal bond with at an early age, usually a mother or father.\\n\\nIn \"Symmetry and Human Facial Attractiveness\" it is posited again that symmetry may act as a marker of phenotypic and genetic quality and is preferred during mate selection in a variety of species. Measures of human body symmetry correlate with attractiveness, but studies manipulating human face images report a preference for asymmetry. These results may reflect unnatural feature shapes and changes in skin textures introduced by image processing. When the shape of facial features is varied (with skin textures held constant), increasing symmetry of face shape increases ratings of attractiveness for both male and female faces. These findings imply facial symmetry may have a positive impact on mate selection in humans. This was tested empirically on perceived \"beautiful people\" in Hollywood and researchers found that on a percentage basis the highest rating of symmetry was achieved by actress Cate Blanchett.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Factoid", "body": "thumbthumbA factoid is a questionable or spurious—unverified, incorrect, or fabricated—statement presented as a fact, but with no veracity. The word can also be used to describe a particularly insignificant or novel fact, in the absence of much relevant context. The word is defined by the Compact Oxford English Dictionary as \"an item of unreliable information that is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact\".\\n\\nFactoid was coined by Norman Mailer in his 1973 biography of Marilyn Monroe. Mailer described a factoid as \"facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper\", and created the word by combining the word fact and the ending -oid to mean \"similar but not the same\". The Washington Times described Mailer's new word as referring to \"something that looks like a fact, could be a fact, but in fact is not a fact\".\\n\\nFactoids may give rise to, or arise from, common misconceptions and urban legend.\\n\\nThe following are many examples of well-known factoids, and the true facts which clarify or debunk them.\\n\\nThe word factoid is now sometimes also used to mean a small piece of true but valueless or insignificant information, in contrast to the original definition. This has been popularized by the CNN Headline News TV channel, which, during the 1980s and 1990s, used to frequently include such a fact under the heading \"factoid\" during newscasts. In the United Kingdom, BBC Radio&nbsp;2 presenter Steve Wright uses factoids extensively on his show.\\n\\nAs a result of confusion over the meaning of factoid, some English-language style and usage guides recommend against its use. Language expert William Safire in his On Language column advocated the use of the word factlet to express a \"little bit of arcana\". Examples of the use of the suffix \"oid\" to denote things that have similar qualities but are not the same include asteroid (\"star-like\" but not a star), spheroid (\"sphere-like\" but not mathematically considered a sphere), and android (\"man-like\" but not human). So strictly by etymology, factoid—\"fact-like\"—would be similar to but not a fact, and therefore untrue. It is with this in mind that \"factoid\" itself, when used improperly, has become an example of the true meaning of factoid'.\\n\\nThe term was also used in the original introduction to the Friend of a Friend Semantic Web project, introducing a technical use of the term grounded in RDF technology: \"Each new home page that appears on the Web tells the world something new, providing factoids and gossip that make the Web a mine of disconnected snippets of information.\"\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Faded Steel Heat", "body": "Faded Steel Heat is the ninth novel in Glen Cook's ongoing Garrett P.I. series. The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett.\\n\\nGarrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not.\\n\\nThis ninth installment in the Garrett series sees Garrett visited at home by three lovely young ladies, Tinnie Tate, Giorgi Nicks, and Alyx Weider, daughter of Max Weider. Alyx explains that she has been sent by her father to get Garrett to investigate an apparent extortion attempt on the Weider business by The Call, a group of human rights activists headed by Marengo North English. Meanwhile, Colonel Block and Deal Relway strike a deal with Garrett: Garrett will attempt to infiltrate The Call, reporting back to Block and Relway on their activities, while Relway and Block will try to help solve the extortion attempt on the Weiders, as well as ensure the safety of the Weiders and Tates during the ordeal.\\n\\nIn typical Garrett fashion, things start to get complicated when Garrett is attacked by a group of thugs while poking around the Weider brewery. After cleaning up and meeting with Max Weider, Max decides it may be best for Garrett to come to Ty Weider’s and Giorgi Nicks' engagement party the following night. When Garrett returns home, the Dead Man concurs, pointing out that it will allow Garrett to investigate the motive of his assailants, as well as help him infiltrate the upper echelons of The Call's society.\\n\\nWith Belinda Contague as his date for the evening, Garrett stumbles into a party that turns dark quickly. By the end of the evening, two of Max Weider's children have been murdered, Max Weider's wife has died, and multiple shapeshifters have been discovered, incapacitated, and arrested. To make matters worse, Belinda Contague gets kidnapped by Crask and Sadler as the evening is winding down.\\n\\nGarrett quickly hightails it to the Palms, where he has Morley hire an expert tracker, a ratgirl by the name of Pular Singe. With Pular's help, Garrett and Morley track down Crask and Sadler, freeing Belinda and dealing the mafia skull-crackers a serious blow. When Garrett returns home, he's shocked by what he finds: Dean and the Dead Man are gone!\\n\\nThe next day, with help from Colonel Block, Garrett tracks down and arrests Crask and Sadler, who are barely alive from their wounds. With this out of the way, Garrett starts his search for information on the shapeshifters, starting by visiting his friend at the Royal Library, Miss Linda Lee. After getting nowhere fast, Garrett heads back to the Weider's estate, where he and Colonel Block manage to sort out just how and why shapeshifters infiltrated the Weider household.\\n\\nWith Tinnie Tate in tow, Garrett heads out to the estate of Marengo North English, where he continues his search for the shapeshifters. North English, who gets injured in a surprise attack against The Call, has little to offer, but Garrett and Tinnie still manage to uncover one shapeshifter in the midst. With the help of Morley, Belinda Contague, and Marengo North English, Garrett hatches a plan to reunite all the guilty parties back at the Weider manor in an all inclusive finale.\\n\\nIn the end, Garrett manages to solve the intertwining mysteries of the Weider murders, the shapeshifters, and The Call, and he even unearths an embezzlement scheme that has bankrupted North English and The Call. After a little more detective work, Garrett and company manage to ferret out the last remaining shapechanger in TunFaire, ending the string of murders and impersonations and bringing a small amount of peace to the city. The Dead Man, who returned home with Dean, actually helped mastermind the finale at the Weider’s estate, where he had overseen the night’s events from his hiding place in a large tank of beer.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary", "body": "Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary is a national marine sanctuary in American Samoa. It is the smallest, yet one of the most important, marine sanctuaries as it is home to more fish and marine mammals than any other marine sanctuary. It also provides a natural food source for shark and other predators of the ocean.\\n\\nthumbFagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary comprises a fringing coral reef ecosystem nestled within an eroded volcanic crater on the island of Tutuila, American Samoa. This smallest and most remote of all the National Marine Sanctuaries is the only true tropical reef in the program. Hence, while it is one of the most protected and beautiful, it also bears the scars of some recent and severe natural disasters.\\n\\nFagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary is completely contained in the  of the bay. The land surrounding the bay resides in the hands of the families who have lived near the bays slopes for thousands of years. Fortunately, there is little development in the watershed and the one reliable stream that empties near the beach runs clear and clean.\\n\\nFagatele Bay is a vibrant tropical reef marine ecosystem, filled with all sorts of brightly-colored tropical fish including parrot fish, damselfish and butterfly fish, as well as other sea creatures like lobster, crab, shark and octopus. From June to September, southern humpback whale migrate north from Antarctica to calve and court in Samoan waters. Visitors can hear courting males sing whale song, which the whales may be using to attract mates. Several species of dolphin, as well as threatened and endangered species of sea turtle, such as the hawksbill and green sea turtle, are frequently seen swimming in the bay as well. Recreational activities such as diving, snorkeling, and fishing can be enjoyed at Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary.\\n\\nFagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary was designated in 1986 in response to a proposal from the American Samoa Government to the National Marine Sanctuary Program. The National Marine Sanctuary Program supports research in all of its 14 sites. Research plays a role in management by supplying information needed to make resource protection decisions based on hard scientific data. Fagatele Bay's most important research project spans over a decade. In the late 1970s, millions of Acanthaster planci or crown-of-thorns starfish (alamea), a coral eating animal, ate their way through Tutuila's reefs. More than 90 percent of all the living corals were destroyed. At the time, Fagatele Bay was not a National Marine Sanctuary, but this disaster propelled the decision for the site's designation.\\n\\nThe National Marine Sanctuary Program protects and preserves nature and local culture. The program is found in areas of special significance such as the oceans and Great Lakes of the United States. There are 14 sanctuaries in the program ranging from Stellwagen Bank off Cape Cod to the Channel Islands in southern California. All manage their precious resources through a combination of education, research, long-term monitoring, regulation and enforcement.\\n\\nMany different types of fish call this reef home, and as such, many biologists and marine researchers attempt to correlate with the local government in an effort to find new species within the local waters. Many new species have been found, but as it is a marine sanctuary, fish or other marine animals cannot be removed from the ecosystem. Scientists, headed up by Dr. Charles Birkenland, used this natural disaster as a focus of their long-term research: to follow the recovery of a coral reef. Because corals grow slowly, the research team chose a multi-year cycle of data collection. Beginning in 1985, and again in 1988, 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2004, the team amassed information on coral, fishes, invertebrates and marine plants. This database is unique for Samoa and the study is one of the few long-running surveys of its type in the world\\n\\nThe sanctuary sponsors education programs, such as the EnviroDiscoveries Camp, which is an outdoor activity and learning camp for 9 to 12 year olds. Scientific programs range from a continuing resource assessment survey, begun in 1985, to coral reef monitoring. Sanctuary regulations prohibit taking invertebrates and sea turtles, as well as historical artifacts. Only traditional fishing methods are permitted in the inner bay.\\n\\nThe sanctuary makes a special effort to work with the American Samoan community with outreach programs for all ages. The sanctuary co-sponsors a summer environmental education program for 9- to 12-year-old children. These programs explore the marine life in the bay, including ancient reef-dwellers and solar-powered clams, teaching ways to protect the resources there. Samoan cultural events and general community outreach/education programs are also run year-round.\\n\\nThe sanctuary also provides guided tours of the area, allows any and every student to come on fieldtrips, for which they provide educational guides. They also give emphasis on the cultural aspects of the reefs and the wildlife so as to combine ones culture with the scientific knowledge that is so neccisary to them. They also help the local education by organising projects that the High schoolers on the island can take part in to further emphasis the necessity of the National Marine Sanctuary.\\n\\nNancy Daschbach is Fagatele Bay's on-site manager. Americorps volunteers assist the outreach program. Staff members are American Samoa Government employees based in Pago Pago, Samoa and operate through a cooperative agreement between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and American Samoa's Economic and Development Planning Office, as well as the National Marine Sanctuary Association (NMSA). The volunteers typically work for 3 months and then take the rest of the time off, but a volunteer can work enough to become a paid worker for the NMSA or even take a Manager position at another Marine Sanctuary.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fairchild Dornier 728 family", "body": "The Fairchild Dornier 728 family was Fairchild Dornier GmbH's ambitious bid to develop a range of regional jet airliners to supplement the smaller 328JET series. Although the aircraft was a modern design and attracted strong airline interest when launched, the program ended with the insolvency of Fairchild Dornier.\\n\\nThe 728 is a monoplane with fixed wings in low wing configuration and two engines mounted under the wing. It has a retractable undercarriage (or landing gear) in tricycle configuration.\\n\\nDornier Luftfahrt GmbH, which was acquired by Fairchild in 1996 and was renamed Fairchild Dornier in 2000, announced the project, which had begun as the X28JET project and later introduced publicly as the 728JET, in October 1997 at the Dubai Airshow. The new family of regional jets seating from 55 to 100 passengers was launched at the ILA Berlin Aerospace Show (International Aviation and Space Flight Exhibition) in Berlin on May 19, 1998 after earlier receiving provisional launch orders from Lufthansa (60 firm orders and 60 options) and Crossair. Crossair later cancelled as a result of the fuselage layout. To prevent Low-cost carrier from equipping the 728 with six-abreast seating, instead of the Cityline's five-abreast seating, Lufthansa made Fairchild Dornier reduce the fuselage diameter. It shrunk from original 3,40 m (11 ft 2 in) to 3,25 m (10 ft 8 in). The reduction also lowered the weight of the aircraft, but brought Crossair to choose the Embraer ERJ-170 family instead. \\n\\nIn June 2001, GECAS ordered 50 aircraft firm and additional options up to 100 aircraft. October 2000 saw the beginning of testing of the \"Iron Bird\" (a mechanical/hydraulic - test rig in 1:1 scale). In March 2001 came the start of the final assembly of the first prototype. In April 2001, General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) began test flights of the CF34-8 engine.\\n\\nFairchild Dornier completed the first fuselage in December 2001. In January 2002 the first prototype moved on its own landing gear. With the official roll out of \"TAC 01\" (Test Aircraft 01 - the first prototype) in March 2002, the 728 was presented to the public for the first time. In March 2002 TAC 03 was transported to IABG in Dresden for structural testing.\\n\\nOverall eight customers, among them Lufthansa Cityline, GECAS, Bavaria Leasing, CSA-Czech Airlines, Atlantic Coast Airlines, and SolAir, had (by March 2002) placed firm orders for 125 aircraft and signed options for an additional 164. \\n\\nThe lead aircraft in the program was the 70 to 85 seat 728 (previously named 728JET), which made its official roll-out on March 21, 2002, and was scheduled to make its first flight in the summer of 2002. Deliveries were expected to start in mid 2003 to Lufthansa Cityline.\\n\\nHowever, before the first flight of the 728 had been made, Fairchild Dornier filed for insolvency on 2 April 2002, and the whole program came to an end, due to Lufthansa and GECAS cancelling their orders shortly after. Without the backup of the programs biggest customers the program paused, and the search for new investors began.\\n\\nIn July 2003, D'Long International Strategic Investment Group of Xinjiang, China showed an interest in buying the project. A new firm, Fairchild Dornier Aeroindustries, was formed to develop the aircraft but filed for bankruptcy in 2004. No aircraft were produced although structural tests in Dresden were launched in 2003.\\n\\nThe 728 is an aircraft with a low wing configuration and two engines mounted one beneath each wing in underwing pods. Like most airliners it is a monoplane with fixed wings and has a retractable undercarriage in tricycle configuration. As usual for this aircraft layout the flight control surfaces are located at the trailing edge of the wings (Ailerons) and at its empennage (stabilizers).\\n\\nThe wing of the 728 is an adapted version of the so called \"TNT\" developed by Dornier for the Do-228. TNT is the German abbreviation for \"Tragflügel Neuer Technologie\" (Wing of New Technology).The low wing was new for the Dornier GmbH because the aircraft types built before (Do-28, Do-228 and Do-328) had a Shoulder wing configuration.\\n\\nIn August 1998, Fairchild Dornier announced it had selected General Electric's FADEC equipped CF34-8D (which has 87% parts commonality with the CF34-8C1 selected to power the competing CRJ-700) ahead of the SNECMA/Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada SPW-14 to power the 728. In September '98 further 728 suppliers were announced, including Honeywell for its Primus Epic integrated EFIS avionics suite with flat panel LCDs, AlliedSignal (APU and environmental control system), Lucas Aerospace (fly-by-wire flight control system), BFGoodrich (landing gear, wheels, tyres, brakes and fuel system), Hamilton Sundstrand (integrated electric system), and Parker Aerospace (hydraulics). CASA would build the wings and empennage.\\n\\nThe basic version of the 728 (728-100), would have been followed at the end of 2003 by the extended range and higher payload 728-200.\\n\\nThree prototypes, TAC 01 - TAC 03 (Test aircraft) were built. TAC 01 was completed with equipment, the second prototype was a complete fuselage in an unfinished stage of installation. TAC 03 was just a fuselage for structural tests. It was brought to Dresden before the insolvency of Fairchild Dornier.\\n\\nThe auction sold (besides many other things) also the prototypes.\\n\\nAll of the variants planned a high degree of commonality, including engine type, and flightdeck, allowing a common pilot type rating.\\n\\nThe 728-100 was to have a passenger capacity of 70 to 85. The 728 had the largest cabin in its class (0.51 m wider than the Embraer 170/190, and 0.70 m wider than the CRJ-700) with five-abreast seating. The 200 was planned to have a 3,000 kg (6615 lbs) higher MTOW and a 750 km (400 NM) increase in range. Uprated CF34-8D3 engines were to be used on the 728-200 instead of the CF34-8D1 engines used in the 728-100.\\n\\nPlanned to follow the 728 into service, the 928 had a stretched fuselage enabling the aircraft to have a passenger capacity of 95 to 110 seats. The first flight was scheduled for late 2003 with entry into service in 2005. The 928 featured an increased wing span. A 928-100 version, as well as a 928-200 version that had an increased MTOW, was planned.\\n\\nThe 528 was to have a shortened 23.38 m (76 ft 9 in) fuselage length and 15.84 m (52 ft 0 in) cabin length would have followed the 928. Passenger capacity was planned to be 55 to 65 seat 528. \\n\\nFairchild Dornier also launched a corporate jet version of the 728, the Envoy 7, which was foreseen to enter service in 2004. The Envoy 7 had intercontinental range and would be equipped with Fairchild Dornier's \"Super Shark\" winglets. Corporate versions of the 528 and 928, the Envoy 5 and Envoy 9 respectively, were also planned.\\n\\n(Performance data is estimated as the aircraft was not flight tested when the program was cancelled.)\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fairey Fulmar", "body": "The Fairey Fulmar was a British carrier-borne fighter aircraft that served with the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) during the Second World War. A total of 600 were built by Fairey Aviation at their Stockport factory between January 1940 and December 1942. The Fulmar's design was based on that of the earlier Fairey P.4/34 that was in turn developed in 1936 as a replacement for the Fairey Battle light bomber. Although its performance (like that of its Battle antecedent) was lacking, the Fulmar was a reliable, sturdy aircraft with long range and an effective eight machine gun armament.\\n\\nThe Fairey P.4/34 was built to Specification P.4/34 as a light bomber capable of being used as a dive bomber, in competition with the Hawker Henley and an unbuilt Gloster design. Its performance was disappointing and it lost out to the Henley (which was eventually ordered as a target tug).\\n\\nThe Fulmar, a navalised version of the P.4/34 was submitted to meet Specification O.8/38 for a two-crew fleet defence fighter. As it was not expected to encounter fighter opposition, high performance or maneuverability was not considered important but long range and heavy armament were. The provision of a navigator/wireless operator was considered essential for the long, over-ocean flights which would be required.\\n\\nLooking much like its sister, the Battle, the Fulmar prototype was aerodynamically cleaner and featured a folding wing that was 16 in (41 cm) shorter than its bomber lookalike. The prototype P.4/34 K5099 first flew on 13 January 1937 at Fairey Aviation's Great West Aerodrome (now London Heathrow Airport) with Fairey test pilot Chris Staniland at the controls. After the first flight tests, the tail was revised, being raised 8 in (20 cm).\\n\\nThe first prototype Fulmar acting as \"flying mock-up\"  was powered by a 1,080 hp (810 kW) Rolls Royce Merlin III engine. With this engine, performance was poor, the prototype only reaching 230 mph (370 km/h). With the Merlin VIII engine - a variant unique to the Fulmar and with supercharging optimised for low-level flight - and aerodynamic improvements, speed was improved to 265 mph (426 km/h) at 7500 ft (2286m), which, owing to the desperate need for modern fighters, was considered adequate. As a simple derivative of an existing prototype, the Fulmar promised to be available quickly and an initial order for 127 production aircraft was placed in mid-1938  and the first example flew from Fairey's facility at RAF Ringway near Manchester on 4 January 1940 and the last of 600 Fulmars was delivered from Ringway on 11 December 1942.thumb\\n\\nThe Fulmar Mk II production began in January 1941, with the first Mk II reaching an operational squadron in March 1941. This mark introduced the more powerful Merlin XXX engine while the airframe was also engineered with several enhancements including provision for a 60 gallon (273 litre) centre-line drop tank, and provision to carry a 250 lb (114 kg) or 500 lb (227 kg) bomb in lieu of the drop tank. Testing of the Fulmar II, at Boscombe Down, in June 1942 showed that the Fulmar could safely drop a 500lb bomb during 60 degree dives at up to 310 knots. Boscombe Down testing in October 1941 showed that the 60 gallon drop tank extended range to 1,100 miles.\\n\\nN1854, the first production Fulmar, was later modified to Mk II standard and then \"civilianised\" as Fairey's hack, G-AIBE. In June 1959, it reverted to service markings and was seen at Farnborough at the SBAC show on 8 September 1962; its last flight was three months later on 18 December 1962. It is now in the FAA Museum, Yeovilton.\\n\\nDuring testing, Fulmars were launched from catapults on merchant ships, a convoy defensive plan that was being evaluated at the time.\\n\\nthumbthumb\\n\\nThe first squadron to be equipped with the Fulmar was No. 806 Squadron FAA in July 1940 and this squadron began operating from  shortly afterwards. The Fulmar was not well matched with land-based fighters. The Navy had specified a two-seat machine, feeling that a navigator was needed to cope with the challenges of navigating over the open ocean. As a result, the Fulmar was far too large and unwieldy when it came into contact with single-seat, land-based opposition, as it did in the Mediterranean Theatre. Yet its long range was useful at times as evidenced in the 1941 chase of the  where Fulmars acted as carrier-borne spotters, tracking and trailing the fleeing battleship.\\n\\nFirst seeing action on Malta convoy protection patrols in September 1940, the sturdy Fulmar was able to achieve victories against its far more agile Italian and German adversaries. By the autumn, Fulmars had shot down ten Italian bombers and six enemy fighters, while giving top cover to the Swordfish raid on Taranto.\\n\\nFulmars played a prominent role in the ill-fated raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo in July 1941.\\n\\nBy 1942, the Fulmar was being replaced by single-seat aircraft adapted from land fighters such as the Supermarine Seafire or by American single seat fighters such as the Grumman Martlet. It saw useful service in nighttime roles as a convoy escort and intruder and was used to train crews for the Fairey Barracuda. On the other hand, its flight characteristics were considered pleasant, its wide undercarriage provided good deck handling capacities and it had excellent fuel capacity and range. Fulmars were used in long-range reconnaissance after they were withdrawn as fighters. Most Fleet Air Arm fighter ace scored at least part of their victories in Fulmars, for example, Sub Lieutenant S.G. Orr, finished the war with 12 confirmed air victories, as the third-highest scoring pilot in the FAA.\\n\\nAt one time, 20 squadrons of the FAA were equipped with the Fulmar. It flew from eight fleet aircraft carriers and five escort carrier. No. 273 Squadron RAF operated them for some months in 1942 from China Bay, Ceylon, seeing action against Japanese forces during the raid on 9 April 1942; though about half the squadron personnel were Navy. Fulmars destroyed 112 enemy aircraft, which made it the leading fighter type, by aircraft shot down, in the Fleet Air Arm during the Second World War. The Fulmar ended its front line operational career on 8 February 1945, when a Fulmar MK II night-fighter from No. 813 Squadron had a landing accident at the safety barrier on  and was written off.\\n\\nApproximately 100 Fulmars were converted to a night fighter variant, but had limited success in this role.\\n\\nThe Vichy French captured some examples of Fulmar Mk II during wartime for propaganda and evaluation use, and later these were taken over by the Germans.\\n\\nSome of the early marks of the aircraft were operated from CAM ship.\\n\\nthumbThe only known survivor is N1854, the Fulmar prototype (and first production Mk I) at the Fleet Air Arm Museum.\\n\\nFulmar\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fairfax County Economic Development Authority", "body": "The Fairfax County Economic Development Authority (FCEDA) is an independent authority in Fairfax County, Virginia, created under Virginia state law in 1964 and funded by Fairfax County government. The FCEDA exists to promote investment and business growth in Fairfax County in order to expand the commercial tax base. The FCEDA does this by managing marketing programs that encourage businesses to expand or relocate to the county. It is the largest non-state economic development authority in the nation.\\n\\nIn addition to its marketing programs, the FCEDA provides assistance to existing and new Fairfax County businesses by locating office space, providing market information, linking entrepreneurs with potential investors, and providing liaison services between businesses and Fairfax County regulatory agencies.\\n\\nThe FCEDA also offers monthly workshops for entrepreneurs interested in starting or expanding a business in Fairfax County. Other programs target foreign-owned and small, minority- and woman-owned businesses.\\n\\nThe FCEDA’s headquarters are in the Tysons Corner area of Fairfax County, with satellite offices located in San Francisco, Bangalore, Frankfurt, London, Seoul and Tel Aviv.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIn 1956 the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors formed an advisory group on economic development called the Industrial Development Commission. This group existed until 1964 when the Virginia General Assembly acted to create the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority. Acting on concerns about population increases and funding of county services, the Board of Supervisors in the late 1970s tasked the FCEDA with its mission to create a business retention and attraction campaign that formed the basis of the EDA’s current programs and purpose.\\n\\nIn his book \"Internet Alley: High Technology in Tysons Corner, 1945-2005,\" (The MIT Press, 2008), Paul E. Ceruzzi summarizes two critical events in the history of Fairfax County economic development: the production of the \"Noman Cole Report\" and the first salvo in what would become an international advertising strategy executed by the Economic Development Authority.\\n\\nCeruzzi explains that in 1976 the newly elected chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, Jack Herrity, commissioned a Blue Ribbon Panel for the purpose of examining the county’s existing ordinances and policies related to industrial development and growth. The panel, named for its chairman, Noman Cole, produced a report entitled the \"Committee to Study the Means of Encouraging Industrial Development in Fairfax County.\"\\n\\nThe Board of Supervisors charged the Economic Development Authority with developing a business attraction and retention program. Earle Williams, one of the contributors to the report, joined the FCEDA Commission around this time and argued for a large increase in the authority’s marketing budget. As part of the marketing strategy, the authority bought a two-page ad in The Wall Street Journal, the cost of which was beyond anything that group had ever done, as Ceruzzi notes,. These early forays into advertising were preludes to what would become a robust global advertising effort that would establish Fairfax County as a \"brand\" unto itself.\\n\\nThe combined impact of pro-growth policies and the attraction and retention campaign (led by the FCEDA advertising program) would prompt Time magazine columnist Justin Fox in 2007 to call Fairfax County \"one of the great economic success stories of our time\".\\n\\nIn 2005 Site Selection Magazine named the FCEDA to its list of top economic development groups for the EDA's successful efforts to expand the number of defense contractors and research organizations in the county.\\n\\nThe FCEDA hosted the first National Conference on the Creative Economy, in Tysons Corner, Virginia in October 2007. The conference program included keynote addresses from Richard Florida, Thomas Friedman and Alvin Toffler.\\n\\nIn 2008 the Washington, D.C.-based International Economic Development Council (IEDC), the largest professional association of economic development practitioners in the world, recognized FCEDA with its 2008 Excellence in Economic Development Award for the FCEDA-produced “Power of Ideas” advertising campaign. The FCEDA received honorable mentions in two other IEDC awards categories in 2008: \"Technology-Based Economic Development Program\" category for localities with more than 200,000 residents and the \"Special Event\" category for localities with more than 200,000 residents, for the 2007 National Conference on the Creative Economy.\\n\\nright\\n\\nIn February, 2009 Hilton Hotels announced it would move its corporate headquarters from Beverly Hills to Fairfax County, Virginia. The Washington Post reported that Hilton Hotels \"surprised the local hotel community...by announcing it was moving to the Washington region from Beverly Hills, [choosing] Fairfax after looking closely at a spot in Montgomery County near Marriott International.\" Hilton Hotels corporate headquarters are located in Tysons Corner.\\n\\nOn June 18, 2009, the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority (FCEDA) hosted “The New Urban Economic Model: The Transformation of Fairfax County\" conference  to examine growth in the county ,MarketWatch reports. The conference was held at the Hilton McLean Tysons Corner in Fairfax County. As noted by Reuters keynote speakers included:\\n\\nThe event's Web site is at: http://www.transformingfairfax.org\\n\\nframe\\n\\nIn April 2010, FCEDA launched a new advertising campaign designed to promote the county’s rich quality of life.\\n\\nThe 30-second TV commercial, called “Statistics,” uses brightly animated statistical information on the county – presented through pie charts and other familiar visuals from business presentations – and morphs those shapes into real-life representations of various quality-of-life elements of Fairfax County. The yellow bar of a bar graph becomes a woman’s clutch, for example, and the blue wedge of a pie chart is transformed into a slice of pizza. The ad is posted at the FCEDA's video gallery. The TV commercial is the first produced by the FCEDA in a decade. It uses locations at George Mason University and a private home in the Fairfax County community of McLean. The spot, produced by Siddall of Richmond, Va., will run through the end of June on cable outlets in four markets – Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. – primarily on news and business channels. The “Statistics” campaign also includes print, online and mobile advertising.\\n\\nThe ad can also be viewed on YouTube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHL1hfslUVQ\\n\\nIn July 2010, Northrop Grumman announced that it would relocate its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to a site in the Falls Church area of Fairfax County.\\n\\nIn August 2010, the Southern Economic Development Council (SEDC, ) announced that Fairfax County won a 2010 Community Economic Development Award in recognition of its success in business attraction.\\n\\nIn December 2010, FCEDA Gordon was named 2010 Virginia Business Person of the Year by Virginia Business magazine, which cited his role in helping attract major business headquarters to Fairfax, County as a key factor in their decision. Also in December, the FCEDA was cited as the top economic development project in the state when the Virginia Chamber of Commerce awarded the authority its Virginia Torchbearer award.\\n\\nThe FCEDA operates under the direction of seven commissioners, who are local business people appointed by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. The commissioners govern and oversee the FCEDA’s policies and programs. Commissioners serve for four-year terms and hire the FCEDA president, who since 1987 has been Gerald L. Gordon, Ph.D.\\n\\nGordon is the author of 10 books, his most recent is The Formula for Economic Growth on Main Street America, published by CRC Press(2009). The book is part of CRC's American Society for Public Administration series designed to increase national and international interest for topics in public administration. The Formula for Economic Growth on Main Street America draws on Dr. Gordon's 25 years of experience as president of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, and his involvement in assisting communities around the world. Dr. Alan Merten, president of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, called the book \"a comprehensive analytic, and clear look at the importance and complexity of economic growth...an important read for both the expert and the student.\"\\n\\nAccording to the FCEDA website, the authority conducts research and stages conferences under the moniker Work/Life to “better understand broad workplace trends that impact businesses in Fairfax County and across the country.” \\n\\nIn September 2007, FCEDA commissioned Ipsos, an independent research firm, to undertake a national poll on creativity in the workplace. The poll found that that, while an overwhelming majority of American workers believe they are instinctively creative, fewer than two in three think they are tapping their creative capacities on the job. The results of the national survey were reported on by such publications as the Wall Street Journal, Christian Science Monitor and Washington Post. The poll results were published in advance of the 2007 National Conference on the Creative Economy, a conference presented by the FCEDA.\\n\\nIn October 2008, the FCEDA commissioned a new survey through Ipsos that examined American workers' opinions of technology in the workplace. The survey found that an overwhelming majority of U.S. workers place a high value on technology in the workplace, so much so that almost 40 percent of employees across the labor force would consider changing jobs to work for an organization that is more committed to providing access to and training in the latest technology. Results of the survey were covered by the Associated Press, the Washington Post and the Fox Business Network.\\n\\nIn May 2009, the FCEDA partnered with Ipsos once again. This time, FCEDA chose to examine issues facing communities that, like Fairfax County, after a long period of suburbanization and increased density, are in transition to a more urban environment. The survey revealed that \"living or working in the suburbs might not be all that it’s cracked up to be.\" Of the one in three (32%) Americans who reportedly live in a suburban environment, a majority (51%) wishes their community had more of a wide variety of offerings. The results of survey were released ahead of the FCEDA conference: “The New Urban Economic Model: The Transformation of Fairfax County\" and was picked up by the Washington Business Journal, WTOP and WMAL radio. The conference featured keynote addresses by Urban Land Institute Senior Resident Fellow (and former Indianapolis mayor) William Hudnut and Brookings Institution urban policy scholar Anthony Downs.\\n\\n"}

The first settlers to this area received land grants from the Lord's Proprietors and worked in the logging and naval stores industries producing lumber, turpentine and pitch for ships. By the late 19th century, a thriving tobacco market had been established as well. The railroads later followed to rapidly move these goods. By the early 20th century, tobacco became king, and by the mid-1950s, Fairmont was considered one of the major tobacco markets in the world.

{"title": "Fajitagate", "body": "Fajitagate was a series of legal and political incidents in San Francisco which began with a street fight on November 20, 2002. The fight involved three off-duty San Francisco Police officers, Alex Fagan Jr., David Lee, and Matt Tonsing, and two San Francisco residents, Adam Snyder and Jade Santoro.\\n\\nAs reported the next day in the San Francisco Chronicle, Snyder and Santoro reported that they were leaving the bar when they were approached by three men who demanded a bag of take out food (the eponymous fajita) which Snyder was taking home. Snyder refused and Santoro told them to leave him alone, words were exchanged, a fight broke out, a beer bottle or some blunt object was thrown, and minor injuries were suffered by Snyder and serious injuries by Santoro. Snyder called 911 on his cellphone and reported Santoro was being beaten to responding officers, and then identified three men in a white pickup truck that drove past the scene as the attackers. The pickup was stopped, and the three off-duty officers were identified and questioned then let go. No arrests were made that night.\\n\\nThe scandal subsequently expanded and would take until 2005 to reach a final criminal resolution. Accused police officer Alex Fagan, Jr. was the son of then San Francisco Police Department assistant Chief (later Chief) Alex Fagan. It was subsequently alleged by then San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan that the elder Fagan, then-SFPD Chief Earl Sanders, and nine other officers were involved in a coverup of the initial November 20, 2002 criminal acts of the three off-duty officers. Sanders and nine other senior officers were indicted by Hallinan and arrested on February 28, 2003, for the crime of obstruction of justice. Sanders took a leave of absence due to the charges, and Alex Fagan, Sr., the next most senior officer automatically became the acting chief. Acting Chief Alex Fagan Sr. in turn resigned in early 2004, and was replaced by Heather Fong on Jan 22, 2004.\\n\\nThe court cases against senior police staff continued through 2003. Hallinan dropped charges against Chief Sanders on March 11, unable to prove a conspiracy had existed. Charges were dropped against almost all the other defendants on April 4, 2003. A key ruling in the case was that under California law, Obstruction of Justice required that there be an active conspiracy of persons who agreed to subvert justice, and not merely an individual or set of individuals acting on their own. Hallinan originally claimed such a conspiracy, but phone and office logs established that there could not have been any significant collusion. Hallinan publicly called for the law to be amended to allow individuals to be charged for independent actions.\\n\\nLater in 2003 and through 2004, most of the senior officers including then ex-Chief Sanders pursued legal appeals to clear their names of the underlying factual claims regarding the obstruction. Sanders and several others were eventually cleared by courts. Sanders took early retirement which he claimed was due to stress from the investigation.\\n\\nCriminal court cases in the original beating against Officers Fagan and Lee were resolved in 2004-5. Officer Lee was found not guilty on November 21, 2004, and Fagan was found not guilty on March 28, 2005.\\n\\nMany officers were charged by the Office of Citizen Complaints for misconduct in the incident. In March 2007, Inspector Paul Falconer and Lt. Henry Para successfully challenged their misconduct charges in a closed hearing of the Police Commission. They were exonerated of all the charges brought against them. At the end of the hearing, one police commissioner stated that it appeared that none of the officers charged by the OCC had done anything wrong.\\n\\nOn June 12, 2006, a civil jury found former officers Fagan and Tonsing liable for damages suffered in the beating, awarding plaintiff Jade Santoro $36,500 in damages. The jury found in favor of Tonsing but against Fagan on plaintiff Adam Snyder's claim, awarding Snyder $9,500. The jury completely exonerated David Lee and Snyder was ordered to pay both Lee and Tonsing's defense costs\\n\\nIn March 2007, many of the officers charged by the Office of Citizen Complaints made deals with the San Francisco Police Commission for time off. Inspector Paul Falconer and Lt. Henry Para successfully challenged their misconduct charges in a closed hearing of the Police Commission. They were exonerated of all the charges brought against them. Police Commissioner Louise Renee stated at the end of that hearing that it appeared that none of the officers charged by the OCC had done anything wrong.\\n\\nA federal court dismissed a civil rights lawsuit against the City of San Francisco in 2006, a decision upheld on appeal in July, 2008 on the basis that the plaintiffs had not shown at trial that any police policy or practice was to blame for the officers' conduct.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Family of Gediminas", "body": "thumb\\n\\nThe family of Gediminas is a group of family members of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania (ca. 1275–1341), who interacted in the 14th century. The family included the siblings, children, and grandchildren of the Grand Duke and played the pivotal role in the history of Lithuania for the period as the Lithuanian nobility had not yet acquired its influence. Gediminas was also the forefather of the Gediminid dynasty, which ruled the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1310s or 1280s to 1572. \\n\\nGediminas' origins are unclear, but recent research suggests that Skalmantas, an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and could be considered the dynasty's founder. Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland. \\n\\nThe relationships among Gediminas' children were generally harmonious, with the notable exception of Jaunutis, who was deposed in 1345 by his brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis. These two brothers went on to provide a celebrated example of peaceful power-sharing. However, Gediminas' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century. Gediminas' grandchildren converted Lithuania to Christianity and inaugurated the first personal union with Poland.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nBecause written sources of the era are scarce, Gediminas' ancestry, early life, and assumption of the title of Grand Duke in ca. 1316 are obscure and continue to be the subject of scholarly debate. Various theories have claimed that Gediminas was either his predecessor Grand Duke Vytenis' son, his brother, his cousin, or his hostler. For several centuries only two versions of his origins circulated. Chronicles—written long after Gediminas' death by the Teutonic Knights, a long-standing enemy of Lithuania—claimed that Gediminas was a hostler to Vytenis; according to these chronicles, Gediminas killed his master and assumed the throne. Another version introduced in the Lithuanian Chronicles, which also appeared long after Gediminas' death, proclaimed that Gediminas was Vytenis' son. However, the two men were almost the same age, making this relationship unlikely. In 1868, a letter issued by the Council of Riga in 1323 was published that contained a small note mentioning Vytenis as \"the brother and predecessor\" of Gediminas. After the letter came to light, textbooks almost universally represented Vytenis and Gediminas as brothers. However, historian Tomas Baranauskas believes the word \"brother\" has been interpreted too literally, and that the two were in fact cousins.\\n\\nGrand Duke Vytenis' origins are relatively well-established; he was the son of Butvydas, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have been related by blood, and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope. \\n\\nRecent research indicates that Gediminids' ancestor may have been Skalmantas. In 1974 historian Jerzy Ochmański noted that Zadonshchina, a poem from the end of the 14th century, contains a line in which two sons of Algirdas name their ancestors: \"We are two brothers – sons of Algirdas, and grandsons of Gediminas, and great-grandsons of Skalmantas.\" This discovery led to the belief that Skalmantas was the long-sought ancestor of the Gediminids. Ochmański posited that the poem skipped the generation represented by Butvydas, and jumped back to the unknown ancestor. Baranauskas disagrees, believing Skalmantas was Butvydas' brother rather than his father, and that Vytenis and Gediminas were therefore cousins.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nIt is known that Gediminas, born about 1275, had one sister (or possibly two, see below for the wife of Andrei of Kozelsk) and several brothers: Vainius, Fiodor of Kiev, possibly Vytenis, and possibly Margiris. If Vytenis, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from about 1295 to 1315, was indeed Gediminas' brother, he was probably the eldest son. Historians recognize one son of Grand Duke Vytenis, Žvelgaitis, who may have died before his father. In 1310 Žvelgaitis, already a mature man, led an army to nearby Livonia in modern-day Latvia and Estonia. After Vytenis died in about 1315, Gediminas became the Grand Duke. There are no sources indicating that Vytenis' brothers or other family members advanced competing claims. \\n\\nVainius first appears in written sources in 1324. In 1326, as Duke of Polatsk, he signed a treaty with the Livonian Order and Novgorod. Scholars place his death sometime between 1338 and 1342. Vainius' only known son, Liubko, died in 1342 during a battle with the Livonian Order. \\n\\nFiodor, whose relationship to Gediminas was not established until the 20th century, was the longest-lived brother, surviving until at least 1362. In about 1325, with help from Gediminas, he became a Duke of Kiev. Fiodor was baptized in the Eastern Orthodox rite and his pagan name is unknown. Kiev was still under the influence of the Golden Horde, and Fiodor acknowledged fealty to the Horde's Khan. This subordination lasted until 1363, when Gediminas' son Algirdas soundly defeated the Horde in the Battle of Blue Waters. Scholarly opinion had long considered Fiodor a Rurikid, rather than a Lithuanian, because of his Christian name. In 1916, however, a list of property belonging to Theognostus, a deceased Metropolitan of Moscow, and compiled in the 1330s, was published; among the items listed were two silver cups gifted by \"Fiodor, brother of Gediminas\".\\n\\nMargiris, the defender of Pilėnai, is often suggested as the most likely candidate for the fourth brother. The chronicles of Hermann de Wartberge mention that in 1329 Gediminas and two of his brothers raided Livonia. By that time Vytenis was already dead and Fiodor was probably occupied with establishing himself in Kiev. One of these two brothers must then have been Vainius; the identity of the other still puzzles historians. Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that he was Margiris because sources attest to his high status and wealth. Sources mention one son of Margiris, who was captured by the Teutonic Knights soon after his father's suicide in 1336 and did not return. \\n\\nThe only direct written mention of Gediminas' sister is a legend describing the murder of two Franciscan friar who came to Vilnius to spread Christianity. This legend was first presented in Chronica XXIV Generalium, a chronicle written before 1369. The events probably took place around 1340, and some eyewitnesses could still have been alive when the chronicle was written. According to the legend Friar Ulrich's preaching angered townspeople. He and his companion, Martin, were seized and brought before Gediminas, who ordered the friars killed. Ulrich was tortured and his body tossed into a river. Martin's body was rescued by Gediminas' sister, an Orthodox nun. She buried Martin at the monastery where she lived. The legend was retold in other sources, including the Bychowiec Chronicle, where the number of martyr was increased to fourteen and the initially realistic story acquired a number of miraculous trappings.\\n\\nIt is uncertain how many wives Gediminas had. The Bychowiec Chronicle mentions three wives: Vida from Courland; Olga from Smolensk; and Jewna from Polotsk, who was Eastern Orthodox and died in 1344 or 1345. Most modern historians and reference works say Gediminas' wife was Jewna, dismissing Vida and Olga as fictitious, since no sources other than this chronicle mention the other two wives. The historian S. C. Rowell argues that Gediminas' wife was a local pagan duchess, on the grounds that his marriage to a princess from a neighboring land would have been noted in other contemporary sources, and that the reliability of the Bychowiec Chronicle has been questioned. \\n\\nAn argument has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox. This case is supported only by the Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik, a late-15th century chronicle, mentioning Narimantas as half-brother to Algirdas. Other historians support this claim by arguing this would explain Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, Jaunutis, as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas and a second wife.\\n\\nBecause none of Gediminas' siblings had strong heirs, Gediminas and his children were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the Grand Duchy. Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas’ diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals to destroy the Teutonic Order and contain the growing power of Moscow and Poland. The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy, while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers. \\n\\nthumbthumb\\n\\nIn 1320 Maria married Dmitri of Tver, ruler of a Russian principality. The marriage took place soon after Mikhail Yaroslavich, Dmitri's father, was killed; his sons were searching for strong allies against Yury of Moscow, their principal competitor for the throne of Vladimir and All Rus'. After 1327 Lithuania began to supplant Tver as Moscow's chief rival for supremacy in the Rus'. When Tver sought to rival Moscow, it needed an alliance with Lithuania. Dmitri was killed in 1325 and Maria never remarried. Maria's brother-in-law, Alexander I, nevertheless maintained friendly relationships with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and his daughter Uliana married Algirdas, the son of Gediminas, who continued the Gediminid line. The cooperation between Lithuania and Tver lasted well into the 15th century.\\n\\nAldona (baptized as Ona or Anna; her pagan name is known only from the writings of the 16th century chronicler Maciej Stryjkowski) married Casimir III of Poland, son of Władysław I of Poland, when he was 15 or 16 years old. The marriage took place on either April 30 or October 16, 1325, and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish–Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights (an alliance foreshadowing the Union of Krewo in 1385 and the Union of Lublin in 1569, with the latter resulting in a stable and powerful new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). This preliminary coalition was short-lived, collapsing in about 1330, but there is no evidence of military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive. \\n\\nThe marriage into the Lithuanian dynasty that had ruled since about 1289 might have lent legitimacy to the rule of Władysław I of the Piast dynasty, who was crowned in 1320, replacing the Přemyslid dynasty. But Aldona died unexpectedly at the end of May 1339 and was buried in Kraków. Aldona had two daughters: Cunigunde (d. 1357) married Louis VI the Roman, the son of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Elisabeth (d. 1361) married Duke Bogislaw V of Pomerania, an area in modern-day Germany and Poland. Elisabeth's daughter, Elizabeth of Pomerania, was the fourth wife of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. \\n\\nGediminas' daughter Elzbieta married Wacław of Płock, one of the dukes of Masovia in modern-day eastern Poland. Her second name is recorded in writings by Maciej Stryjkowski as Danmila and Teodor Narbutt as Damila. It has been suggested these names are misread versions of Danutė, a name derived from Daniel. Another interpretation is that historians confused Danutė of Lithuania, daughter of Kęstutis, with Elzbieta. As an alliance, the marriage was significant because passages to and from western Europe had to pass through Masovia; it can be seen as an attempt to revive Grand Duke Traidenis' and his daughter Gaudemunda's link with Masovia in the 1270s. The marriage's importance is attested by Elzbieta's dowry: 720 Kraków silver marks and nine marks of gold – three times more than an ordinary recorded dowry of the time. This marriage probably took place about 1316, when Gediminas supported Wacław during a civil war in the divided Duchy of Masovia. After Wacław's death in 1336, Elzbieta managed her own wealth. She is mentioned for the last time in 1361, when her brother Kęstutis escaped from Marienburg and sought refuge at his sister's house; historians put her date of death at around 1364. In 1337 Elzbieta's daughter Anna, first mentioned in late 1323, married Henry of Żagań, in modern-day western Poland. Her son Bolesław III or Bolko died without a male heir in 1351 and his land was divided among other dukes.\\n\\nEufemija (also known as Marija, Ofka, and Anka) married Bolesław Jerzy II of Galicia, in modern-day Ukraine, in 1331. The marriage was engineered in 1323 when the brothers Lev and Andrew of Galicia were slain without leaving heirs. Instead of replacing them with his own son Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas forged a compromise with Władysław I of Poland. Both parties agreed to install Bolesław, cousin of Władysław I and nephew of Gediminas' son-in-law Wacław of Płock, with the marriage to take place later. Bolesław at the time was fourteen years old. In this way the war for control of Galicia–Volhynia was postponed until after Bolesław's poisoning in 1340; control of the area was not stabilized until 1370. According to Teodor Narbutt, Eufemija was drowned beneath the ice of the Vistula River on February 5, 1342, in order to keep her out of the succession disputes.\\n\\nAigusta was baptized as Anastasia in order to marry Simeon of Russia in 1333; he became Grand Prince of Moscow in 1341. There is no direct evidence that she was a daughter of Gediminas, but because the marriage was high-profile, most historians have concluded that she was a member of Gediminas' family. The marriage had great potential because Lithuania and Moscow were fierce rivals for supremacy in Ruthenia, but conflicts broke out again in 1335, just two years after the marriage. Her two sons Vasilei and Konstantin did not survive infancy; her daughter Vasilisa married Mikhail Vasilevich of Kashin, a Tverite prince opposing Lithuania. Her brother Jaunutis sought her help when he was deposed by Algirdas in 1345. Immediately before her death on March 11, 1345, Aigusta became a nun. She was buried within the Moscow Kremlin at a monastic church whose construction she had sponsored.\\n\\nIt is possible that Gediminas had two more daughters. According to Maciej Stryjkowski, one of Gediminas' daughters was married to David, his favorite war leader. However, some historians disagree with the conclusion that David was Gediminas' son-in-law, expressing skepticism about the reliability of Stryjkowski's sources. The existence of another daughter, or possibly another sister, has been hypothesized based on the list of Metropolitan Theognostus' property published in 1916. The list contains a note describing Andrei Mstislavich, Duke of Kozelsk (ruled ca. 1320 — 1339), as Gediminas' son-in-law. On the other hand, the Ruthenian word ziat' (зять) can mean either \"son-in-law\" or \"sister's husband\". Hence Andrei of Kozelsk could have been Gediminas' brother-in-law.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe chronicle of John of Winterthur contains a reference to Gediminas' eight sons. The names of seven sons can be found in various written sources, while the identity of the eighth remains disputed. Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that this son was the Duke of Trakai who perished in 1337 near Veliuona. Duke of Trakai was an important position held either by the Grand Duke himself or his second-in-command. Therefore 18th- and 19th-century historians believed that it was Gediminas himself who died in Veliuona, which still advertises itself as the place of Gediminas' burial. Nikžentaitis further postulates that the name of the unknown son might have been Vytautas, as records mention a young and powerful Yuri, son of Vytautas and deputy of Andrei, son of Algirdas. Yuri died in 1348. His high position in youth could easily be accounted for by being a grandson of Gediminas. However, others dispute these theories, arguing that the note in John of Winterthur's chronicle was misinterpreted.\\n\\nIt is unclear why, but Jaunutis, a middle son not mentioned in any written sources before the coup d'état accomplished by his brothers, was designated by Gediminas as his heir in Vilnius and consequently became the Grand Duke. His brother Kęstutis, Duke of Trakai, was assisting him in Samogitia. Despite help from Narimantas, Jaunutis was deposed by his brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis in 1345, just four years after Gediminas' death. Jaunutis tried, but failed, to solicit help from his brother-in-law Simeon of Russia and was baptized as Iwan in the process. He was forced to reconcile with Algirdas and in compensation received the Duchy of Zasłaŭje, which he ruled until his death in 1366.\\n\\nSeveral sons of Gediminas continued his male line, but it was Algirdas who continued the main Gediminid line. Before deposing his brother Jaunutis in 1345, he ruled Kreva and, despite remaining pagan, married Maria, a daughter of the last prince of Vitebsk. After 1345 he became the Grand Duke of Lithuania and shared his power with his brother Kęstutis. Their successful collaboration is celebrated in Lithuanian historiography, and gave rise to a much debated theory that a tradition of co-rule or diarchy in Lithuania was customary and arose as early as 1285. The Grand Duchy experienced its greatest expansion during their reign. While Algirdas was mostly active in the east, Kęstutis occupied himself by managing the Duchy's interactions with the Teutonic Knights, Poland, and other western European entities. In 1350 Algirdas contracted a second marriage with Uliana of Tver; he chose their son Jogaila as the next Grand Duke. In 1385 Jogaila opened a new chapter in the history of Lithuania by converting the country to Christianity and signing a personal union with Poland, becoming King of Poland. This Polish–Lithuanian union, in various forms, survived until the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. Jogaila's branch of the Gediminids is known as the Jagiellon dynasty. \\n\\nthumbKęstutis, Duke of Trakai, despite exercising considerable autonomy while controlling the western provinces of the duchy, was loyal to Algirdas and acknowledged his superiority. Kęstutis was a devoted pagan and dedicated his life to defending Lithuania from the Teutonic Knights. A popular romantic legend arose about his marriage to the pagan priestess Birutė of Palanga. They had seven or eight children, including Vytautas the Great. After Algirdas' death in 1377, his son Jogaila became the Grand Duke. At first Kęstutis and his son Vytautas acknowledged Jogaila's rule, but after Jogaila signed the controversial Treaty of Dovydiškės with the Teutonic Knights, Kęstutis seized Vilnius and became the Grand Duke in late 1381. In August 1382 he was imprisoned in Kreva and died there. Vytautas continued his fight for supremacy, and the conflicts between the descendants of Algirdas and Kęstutis lasted well into the 15th century. \\n\\nManvydas was the eldest son of Gediminas and inherited the territories of Kernavė and Slonim from his father. Little is known about him, and he died soon after Gediminas. It is believed that he was killed in the Battle of Strėva in 1348 along with his brother Narimantas. \\n\\nNarimantas was the second son of Gediminas. He was baptized as Gleb and went on to rule Pinsk, Polotsk, and – as his patrimony by invitation of Novgorod's nobles – Ladoga, Oreshek and Korela. He initiated a tradition of Lithuanian mercenary service north of Novgorod on the Swedish border that lasted until Novgorod's fall to Moscow in 1477 and helped keep Moscow at bay. In 1345 Narimantas became the strongest supporter of his deposed brother Jaunutis and went to Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde, to ask for support against Algirdas and Kęstutis. There are rumors that Narimantas married a Tatar princess, but they lack credibility. After a few years the brothers reconciled, and it is believed that Narimantas led the Battle of Strėva in the name of Algirdas and died there. He left behind three to five sons who founded Russian princely families, including Kurakin and Galitzine.\\n\\nKarijotas was baptized as Mikhail and inherited Navahrudak in Black Ruthenia. In 1348 he was sent by Algirdas to Khan Jani Beg to negotiate a coalition against the Teutonic Knights, but was handed over to Moscow for ransom. He died about 1363. It is uncertain how many children he had: the number varies between four and nine. \\n\\nLiubartas (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' youngest son. In the early 1320s he married a daughter of Andrew of Galicia and ruled Lutsk in eastern Volhynia. After Andrew's and his brother Lev of Galicia's deaths about 1323, Galicia–Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia. War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The Galicia–Volhynia Wars were settled after 1370, when Poland received Galicia, while Lithuania retained Volhynia. Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty years. He had three sons.\\n\\nGediminas\\n\\n"}

Congress subsequently passed the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to help save family farm from foreclosure.\\n\\nToday, Farm Aid is an organization that works to increase awareness of the importance of family farms, and puts on an annual concert of country, blues and rock music with a variety of stars. The board of directors includes Nelson, Mellencamp, Neil Young, and Dave Matthews. Young's speeches about the environment are a highlight of the annual shows.\\n\\nThe 2005 concert, marking the 20th anniversary of Farm Aid, took place at the Tweeter Center in Tinley Park, Illinois, with events in downtown Chicago as well. The 2007 Concert took place at Randall's Island in New York City (1st Farm Aid in New York) and was recorded in High Definition to be broadcast on HDNet as a 2 Hour Special highlighting many of the performances from the Allman Brothers and Counting Crows to John Mellencamp and Willie Nelson.\\n\\nThrough 2010, Farm Aid concerts have been held in the following locations:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Farmington, Missouri", "body": "Farmington is a city in St. Francois County located  south of St. Louis in the Lead Belt region in Missouri in the United States. As of the 2000 U.S. Census, the population was 13,924; a 2008 estimate, however, showed the population to be 16,097. It is the county seat of St. Francois County. The Farmington Micropolitan Statistical Area embraces St. Francois County and Washington County.\\n\\nFarmington was established in 1822 after its agricultural history and was previously known as Murphy's Settlement for William Murphy of Kentucky who first visited the site in 1798. When St. Francois County was organized, the town was briefly called St. Francois Court House and then later renamed to Farmington.\\n\\nFarmington is located at  (37.781932, -90.422145). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.0 square miles (23.3 km²), of which, 8.9 square miles (23.2 km²) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km²) of it (0.44%) is water.\\n\\nArriving upon land west of the Mississippi River in 1798—which was, at that time, part of the upper Louisiana Territory and under Spanish rule—was the Irish born William Murphy. Murphy was searching for the ideal site to relocate his family and, as the tradition goes, came to find a spring near the now-standing St. Francois County Courthouse with the aid of a local Native American. Deciding that this was an excellent place to set up home, Murphy acquired a Spanish Land Grant, allowing him and his family to establish a settlement along the St. Francois River. In his travels back to Kentucky, Murphy passed, leaving it up to his wife, Sarah Barton Murphy, and their grown sons to establish the settlement–which they did when arriving to the site around 1800. Named Murphy’s Settlement, Sarah Barton Murphy is known to have assembled the premier Protestant Sunday School west of the Mississippi River. Due to Spanish law barring any religious services that were not of Roman Catholic tradition, Murphy and her students orchestrated the learning in secret.A post office in Murphy’s Settlement opened in 1817, followed by the annexation of the land to the United States through the Louisiana Purchase–creating the state of Missouri. With the advent of this, David Murphy made a contribution of  of land for the installation of the county seat of what was soon to be St. Francois County in 1822. The name of the town, Farmington, was selected in 1825, with incorporation as a town granted in 1836–soon becoming a village 20 years later in 1856.In the mid-19th century, Farmington enjoyed growth and economic well-being through the building of the historic Plank Road, which stretched from Pilot Knob to Ste. Genevieve. The road was built to transport both supplies from the shipping facilities located along the river to the mines and to move the mine’s iron ore to the shipping facilities. The route was soon taken over by the St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad.The first public school was constructed in 1870 and in 1879, Farmington gained the recognition as a fourth-class city–an accolade that was surpassed in 1981 when Farmington became a third-class city.Laying down roots more than two centuries ago, Farmington has certainly become a prosperous Midwestern city. Since its 1860 population of 500, the city has transformed into a community of more than 19,000.

Tolkien's fiction universe of Middle-earth, the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves were the first of their race.\\n\\nIt is told in The Silmarillion that the Vala Aulë created the Dwarves because he was impatient for the arising of the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and Men). He created seven Dwarves, and was teaching them the language he had devised for them (Khuzdul) when Ilúvatar confronted him. Aulë offered his creations to Ilúvatar, who accepted them and gave them life. \\n\\nHowever, the Fathers of the Dwarves had to wait until the Elves first arrived, and Aulë laid them to rest in various places in the continent of Middle-earth.\\n\\nDurin I was the eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and the first of his kind to awake in Middle-earth. Durin I belonged to what later became known as the clan of Longbeards.\\n\\nThe Dwarves were created in ancient times by Aulë, one of the Valar. Aulë was a smith and a craftsman and he wanted to teach his skills to the Dwarves. He made Durin first and then six others. But Eru had intended the Elves to be the Firstborn race so he commanded Aulë to put the Dwarves to sleep until after the Elves awoke. Eru gave each of the Dwarves a lifeforce so they could exist as independent beings. \\n\\nDurin was the first to awaken, and awoke in Mount Gundabad, north of Moria.\\n\\nTwo others were laid in sleep in the north of the Ered Luin or Blue Mountains, and they founded the lines of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards who later lived in Belegost and Nogrod respectively.\\n\\nThe other four Fathers of Dwarves were laid down in the far east in two locations, separated from Gundabad and each other by distances at least as great as that between the Ered Luin and Gundabad. These founded the lines of the Ironfists and Stiffbeards, and Blacklocks and Stonefoots. No Dwarves of these lines appear in the tales; however, as noted below, the Longbeards may be formed out of Dwarves from all lines, and Dwarves from Durin's Folk may therefore have ancestors from these other lines. During the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, forces from all clans took part in the fighting under the Hithaeglir, at the request of Durin's Folk.\\n\\nOf the Fathers of the Dwarves, only Durin is said to have \"lain alone\". This can be interpreted as referring to the fact he was indeed laid down to rest alone while the other Fathers were laid to rest in pairs, but older versions of the story suggest that it meant Durin alone had no female companion. The other Fathers did: references are made by Tolkien to the \"Thirteen Dwarves\" created by Aulë (Durin and the six pairs). By this version of the story, Durin's Folk were formed out of Dwarves from the other six lines, as a mixed people arose when all Dwarves went to Gundabad.\\n\\nAfter the end of the First Age, when the ancestral homes of the Broadbeams and Firebeards were ruined, many dwarves from these clans crossed Eriador and merged with Durin's Folk in Khazad-dûm, although remnants of these two western nations may well have survived as independent entities in the Ered Luin; seven rings were given to 'the Dwarf Lords' by Sauron in the Second Age, for example, and certainly the Blue Mountains remained permanently inhabited by dwarves of one clan or another throughout the history of Middle-earth: Thorin Oakenshield, for example, grew up there as an exile from his homeland Erebor, and several of his companions on his quest to reclaim that realm were not related to him (Bifur, Bofur and Bombur).\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Faun", "body": "thumb\\n\\nThe faun (also phaunos or faunus) is a rustic forest god or place-spirit (genii) of Roman mythology often associated with Greek satyr and the Greek god Pan.\\n\\nThe faun is a half human - half goat (from the head to the waist being the human half, but with the addition of goat's horns) manifestation of forest and animal spirits which would help or hinder humans at whim. Romans believed fauns inspired fear in men traveling in lonely, remote or wild places but were also capable of guiding humans in need. \\n\\nThese beliefs have their roots in Greek mythology - Nonnus' Dionysiaca gives the following description of the faun's relationship with nature:\\n\\nThough the text uses the word phaunus and describes the nature-spirit faun, the followers of Dionysus (Bacchus in later Roman mythology) are more accurately satyr; the wild and orgiastic spirits that harassed nymphs. Fauns and satyrs were originally quite different creatures: whereas fauns are half-man and half-goat, satyrs originally were depicted as stocky, hairy, ugly dwarfs or wood woses with the ears and tails of horses or asses. \\n\\nAncient Roman mythological belief also included a god named Faunus and a goddess named Fauna who were goat-people.\\n\\nThe Barberini Faun (located in the Glyptothek in Munich, Germany) is a Hellenistic marble statue from c. 200 BC that was found in the Mausoleum of the Emperor Hadrian (the Castel Sant'Angelo) and installed at Palazzo Barberini by Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (later Pope Urban VIII). Gian Lorenzo Bernini restored and refinished the statue.\\n\\nThe House of the Faun was so named because of the dancing faun statue found at the house.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fausto Coppi", "body": "Angelo Fausto Coppi, (15 September 1919, Castellania, Province of Alessandria – 2 January 1960, Tortona, Province of Alessandria), was the dominant international cyclist of the years each side of the second world war. His successes earned him the title Il Campionissimo, or champion of champions. He was an all-round racing cyclist: he excelled in both climbing and time trialing, and was also a great sprinter. He won the Giro d'Italia five times (1940, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953), the Tour de France twice (1949 and 1952), and the World Championship in 1953. Other notable results include winning the Giro di Lombardia five times, the Milan – San Remo three times, as well as wins at Paris–Roubaix and La Flèche Wallonne and setting the hour record (45.798 km) in 1942.\\n\\nCoppi was one of five children born to Domenico Coppi and his wife, Angiolina Boveri, who married on 29 July 1914. Fausto was the fourth child, born at 5pm on 15 September 1919. His mother wanted to call him Angelo, but his father preferred Fausto. He was named Angelo Fausto but was known most of his life as Fausto.\\n\\nCoppi had poor health as a child and showed little interest in school. In 1927 he was condemned to write \"I ought to be at school, not riding my bicycle\" after skipping lessons to spend the day riding a family bike he had found in a cellar, rusty and without brake blocks. He left school at 13 to work for Domenico Merlani, a butcher in Novi Ligure more widely known as Signor Ettore.\\n\\nCycling to and from the shop and meeting cyclists who came there interested him in racing. The money to buy a bike came from his uncle, also called Fausto Coppi, and his father. Coppi said:\\n\\nHe rode his first race at 15, among other boys not attached to cycling clubs, and won 20 lire and a salami sandwich for first prize. Coppi took a racing licence at the start of 1938 and won his first race, at Castelleto d'Orba, near the butcher's shop. He won alone, winning an alarm clock.\\n\\nA regular caller at the butcher's shop in Novi Ligure was a former boxer who had become a masseur, a job he could do after losing his sight, in 1938. Giuseppe Cavanna was known to friends as Biagio. Coppi met him that year, recommended by another of Cavanna's riders. Cavanna suggested in 1939 that Coppi should become an independent, a class of semi-professionals who could ride against both amateurs and professionals. He sent him to the Tour of Tuscany that April with the advice: \"Follow Gino Bartali!\" He was forced to stop with a broken wheel. But at Varzi on 7 May 1939 he won one of the races counting to the season-long national independent championship. He finished seven minutes clear of the field and won his next race by six minutes.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nRaphaël Géminiani said of Coppi's domination:His first large success was in 1940, winning the Giro d'Italia at the age of 20. In 1942 he set a world hour record (45.798 km at the Velodromo Vigorelli in Milan) which stood for 14 years until it was broken by Jacques Anquetil in 1956. His career was then interrupted by the Second World War. In 1946 he resumed racing and achieved remarkable successes which would be exceeded only by Eddy Merckx. The veteran writer Pierre Chany said that from 1946 to 1954 Coppi was never once recaught once he had broken away from the rest.\\n\\nTwice, 1949 and 1952, Coppi won the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France in the same year, the first to do so. He won the Giro five times, a record shared with Alfredo Binda and Eddy Merckx. During 1949's Giro he left Gino Bartali by 11 minutes between Cuneo and Pinerolo. Coppi won the 1949 Tour de France by almost half an hour over everyone except Bartali. From the start of the mountains in the Pyrenees to their end in the Alps, Coppi took back the 55 minutes by which Jacques Marinelli led him.\\n\\nHe won the Giro di Lombardia a record five times (1946, 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1954). He won Milan – San Remo three times (1946, 1948 and 1949). In the 1946 Milan – San Remo he attacked with nine others, five kilometres into a race of 292 km. He dropped the rest on the Turchino climb and won by 14 minutes. He also won Paris–Roubaix and La Flèche Wallonne (1950). He was also 1953 world road champion. \\n\\nIn 1952 Coppi won on the Alpe d'Huez, which had been included for the first time that year. He attacked six kilometres from the summit to rid himself of the French rider, Jean Robic. Coppi said: \"I knew he was no longer there when I couldn't hear his breathing any more or the sound of his tyres on the road behind me.\" He rode like \"a Martian on a bicycle\", said Raphaël Géminiani. \"I saw a phenomenal rider that day.\" Coppi won the Tour by 28m 27s and the organiser, Jacques Goddet, had to double the prizes for lower placings to keep other riders interested. It was his last Tour, having ridden three and won two.\\n\\nBill McGann wrote:\\n\\nCoppi broke the world hour record on the track in Milan on 7 November 1942. He rode a 93.6 inch (2.43 metre) gear and pedaled with an average cadence of 103.3rpm. The bike is on display in the chapel of Madonna del Ghisallo near Como, Italy. His times were:\\n\\nCoppi beat Maurice Archambaud's 45.767 km, set five years earlier on the same track. The record stood until it was beaten by Jacques Anquetil in 1956.\\n\\nCoppi's racing days are generally referred to as the beginning of the golden years of cycle racing. A factor is the competition Coppi had with Gino Bartali. Italian tifosi (fans) divided into coppiani and bartaliani. Bartali's rivalry with Coppi divided Italy. Bartali, conservative, religious, was venerated in the rural, agrarian south, while Coppi, more worldly, secular, innovative in diet and training, was hero of the industrial north. The writer Curzio Malaparte said:\\n\\nTheir lives came together on 7 January 1940 when Eberardo Pavesi, head of the Legnano team, took on Coppi to ride for Bartali. Their rivalry started when Coppi, the helping hand, won the Giro and Bartali, the star, marshalled the team to chase. By the 1949 world championship at Valkenburg (South Holland) in the Netherlands, both climbed off rather than help the other. The Italian cycling association said: \"They have forgotten to honour the Italian prestige they represent. Thinking only of their personal rivalry, they abandoned the race, to the approbation of all sportsmen.\" They were suspended for three months.\\n\\nThe thaw partly broke when the pair shared a bottle on the Col d'Izoard in the 1952 Tour but the two fell out over who had offered it. \"I did,\" Bartali insisted. \"He never gave me anything.\" Their rivalry was the subject of intense coverage and resulted in epic races.\\n\\nCoppi joined the army as soldier 7375 of the 38th Infantry when Italy entered the second world war. Officers favoured him at first to keep him riding his bike but in March 1943 they sent him to North Africa. There he was taken prisoner by the British between Mateur and Medjez-el-Bab on 13 April. He was kept in a prisoner of war camp, where he shared plates with the father of Claudio Chiappucci, who rode the Tour in the 1990s. He was given odd jobs to do. The British cyclist Len Levesley said he was astonished to find Coppi giving him a haircut. Levesley, who was on a stretcher with polio, said: \\n\\nThe British moved Coppi to an RAF base at Caserta in Italy in 1945. There he worked for an officer who had never heard of him. Coppi was allowed liberal terms, the war being as good as over. On release he cycled and hitched lifts home. On Sunday 8 July 1945 he won the Circuit of the Aces in Milan after four years without racing. The following season he won Milan – San Remo (about this years see also \"Viva Coppi!\", historical novel by Filippo Timo).\\n\\nCoppi was often said to have introduced \"modern\" methods to cycling, particularly his diet. Gino Bartali established that some of those methods included taking drugs, which were not then against the rules. \\n\\nBartali and Coppi appeared on television revues and sang together, Bartali singing about \"The drugs you used to take\" as he looked at Coppi. Coppi spoke of the subject in a television interview:\\n\\nCoppi \"set the pace\" in drug-taking, said his contemporary, the Dutchman, Wim van Est. Rik van Steenbergen said Coppi was \"the first I knew who took drugs.\" That didn't stop Coppi's protesting against others using it. He told René de Latour:\\n\\nCoppi named four riders among the best in the world as amateurs but who failed as professionals despite predictions made for them. \"If they sue me for defamation,\" he said, \"all the better. The facts will be brought to light and this may mean a change in our methods.\"\\n\\nCoppi broke bones throughout his career.\\n\\nthumb\\n\\nThe Woman in White was Giulia Occhini, described by the French broadcaster Jean-Paul Ollivier as \"strikingly beautiful with thick chestnut hair divided into enormous plaits.\" She was married to an army captain, Enrico Locatelli. Coppi was married to Bruna Ciampolini. Locatelli was a cycling fan. His wife wasn't but she joined him on 8 August 1948 to see the Tre Valli Varesine race. Their car was caught beside Coppi's in a traffic jam. That evening Occhini went to Coppi's hotel and asked for a photograph. He wrote \"With friendship to...\", asked her name and then added it. From then on the two spent more and more time together. \\n\\nItaly was a straight-laced country in which adultery was thought of poorly. In 1954, Luigi Boccaccini of La Stampa saw her waiting for Coppi at the end of a race in St-Moritz. She and Coppi hugged and La Stampa printed a picture in which she was described as la dama in bianco di Fausto Coppi - the \"woman in white\".\\n\\nIt took only a while to find out who she was. She and Coppi moved in together but so great was the scandal that the landlord of their apartment in Tortona demanded they move out. Reporters pursued them to a hotel in Casteletto d'Orba and again they moved, buying the Villa Carla, a house near Novi Ligure. There police raided them at night to see if they were sharing a bed. Pope Pius XII asked Coppi to return to his wife. He refused to bless the Giro d'Italia when Coppi rode it. The Pope then went through the Italian cycling federation. Its president, Bartolo Paschetta, wrote on 8 July 1954: \\n\\nBruna Ciampolini refused a divorce. To end a marriage was shameful and still illegal in some parts of the country. Coppi was shunned and spectators spat at him. He and Giulia Occhini had a son, Faustino.\\n\\nCoppi's career declined after the scandal. He had already been hit in 1951 by the death of his younger brother, Serse Coppi who crashed in a sprint in the Giro del Piemonte and died of a cerebral haemorrhage. Coppi could never match his old successes. Pierre Chany said he was first to be dropped each day in the Tour of Spain in 1959. Criterium organisers frequently cut their races to 45 km to be certain that Coppi could finish, he said. \"Physically, he wouldn't have been able to ride even 10km further. He charged himself [took drugs] before every race.\" Coppi, said Chany, was \"a magnificent and grotesque washout of a man, ironical towards himself; nothing except the warmth of simple friendship could penetrate his melancholia. But I'm talking of the end of his career. The last year! In 1959! I'm not talking about the great era. In 1959, he wasn't a racing cyclist any more. He was just clinging on [il tentait de sauver les meubles]\" \\n\\nJacques Goddet wrote in an appreciation of Coppi's career in L'Équipe: We would like to have cried out to him ' Stop!' And as nobody dared to, destiny took care of it.\"\\n\\nthumbIn December 1959, the president of Burkina Faso, Maurice Yaméogo, invited Coppi, Raphaël Géminiani, Jacques Anquetil, Louison Bobet, Roger Hassenforder and Henry Anglade to ride against local riders and then go hunting. Géminiani remembered: \\n\\nBoth caught malaria and fell ill when they got home. Géminiani said: \\n\\nGeminiani was diagnosed as being infected with plasmodium falciparum, one of the more fatal strains of malaria. Géminiani recovered but Coppi died, his doctors convinced he had a bronchial complaint. La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Italian daily sports paper, published a Coppi supplement. The editor wrote that he prayed that God would soon send another Coppi.\\n\\nthumbIn January 2002 a man identified only as Giovanni, who lived in Burkina Faso until 1964, said Coppi died not of malaria but died of an overdose of cocaine. The newspaper Corriere dello Sport said Giovanni had his information from Angelo Bonazzi. Giovanni said: \"It is Angelo who told me that Coppi had been killed. I was a supporter of Coppi, and you can imagine my state when he told me that Coppi had been poisoned in Fada Gourma, at the time of a reception organised by the head of the village. Angelo also told me that [Raphael] Géminiani was also present… Fausto's plate fell, they replaced it, and then…\" \\n\\nThe story has also been attributed to a 75-year-old Benedictine monk called Brother Adrien. He told Mino Caudullo of the Italian National Olympic Committee: \"Coppi was killed with a potion mixed with grass. Here in Burkina Faso this awful phenomenon happens. People are still being killed like that.\" Coppi's doctor, Ettore Allegri, dismissed the story as \"absolute drivel.\"\\n\\nA court in Tortona opened an investigation and asked toxicologists about exhuming Coppi's body to look for poison. A year later, without exhumation, the case was dismissed.\\n\\nThe Giro remembers Coppi as it goes through the mountain stages. A mountain bonus, called the Cima Coppi, is awarded to the first rider who reaches the Giro's highest summit. In 1999, Coppi placed second in balloting for greatest Italian athlete of the 20th century.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Faversham explosives industry", "body": "The Faversham explosives industry: Faversham, in Kent, England, has claims to be the cradle of the UK's explosives industry: it was also to become one of its main centres. The first gunpowder plant in the UK was established in the 16th century, possibly at the instigation of Faversham Abbey. With their estates and endowments monasteries were keen to invest in promising technology.\\n\\nThe Faversham was well-placed for the industry. It had a stream which could be dammed at intervals to provide power for watermill. On its outskirts were low-lying areas ideal for the culture of alder and willow to provide charcoal — one of the three key gunpowder ingredients. The stream fed into a tidal Creek where sulphur, another key ingredient, could be imported, and the finished product loaded for dispatch to Thames-side magazines. The port was also near the Continent where in warfare demand for gunpowder was brisk.\\n\\nThe first factories were small, near the town, and alongside the stream, between the London to Dover road (now the A2 road) and the head of the creek. By the early 18th century these had coalesced into a single plant, later to be known as the Home Works, as it was the town’s first.\\n\\nAt this time the British government was buying its supplies from the private sector; but the quality was often poor, and in 1759 it decided it needed its own plant. Rather than build a new one, it nationalised the Home Works, upgrading all the machinery. From this phase dates the Chart Gunpowder Mill, the oldest of its kind in the world (). This was rescued from the jaws of the bulldozer, and then restored, by the Faversham Society in 1966. (It is now open to the public on weekend and bank holiday afternoons from April till the end of October.)\\n\\nNearby is Stonebridge Pond, today a picturesque beauty spot at the head of the creek. It served to power some of the works’ watermills, slender remains of which survive. It still features a network of narrow-gauge canals along which powder was punted from process to process.\\n\\nIn the 1680s a second factory was started by Huguenot asylum-seekers alongside another stream about 2 km west of the town (). This had its own access to the sea via Oare Creek and so became known as the Oare Works, though it was wholly in the parish of Davington. It became a leading supplier to the East India Company and it could be argued that without its product English would not have become the lingua franca of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\\n\\nGunpowder from Faversham was not just used in warfare. It played a key part in the Industrial Revolution, by enabling routes to be blasted for canals and railways.\\n\\nThe third and last gunpowder factory to open was the Marsh Works (), built by the British government 1 km northwest of the town to augment output at its Home Works and opened in 1787. This also had access to the sea via Oare Creek.\\n\\nAll three gunpowder factories shut in 1934. ICI, then the owners, sensed that war might break out with Germany, and realised that Faversham would then become vulnerable to air attacks or possibly invasion. They transferred production, together with key staff and machinery, to Ardeer in Ayrshire, Scotland.\\n\\nThe Marsh Works then became a site for mineral extraction, as it remains today, and almost all its buildings were destroyed. Except for Chart Mill, Stonebridge Pond, and a few other buildings, most of the Home Works site was redeveloped for housing in the 1960s.\\n\\nThe Oare Works is now an attractive country park, open to the public free of charge all year round. Remains of process houses have been carefully conserved. From an informative visitor centre, signed trails radiate in various directions. An early 20th century electric-powered gunpowder mill which was transferred to Ardeer in 1934 has been repatriated and is on display. The 18th-century works bell has also been repatriated and is on display at Faversham's Fleur de Lis Heritage Centre.\\n\\nWith their streams, watermills and forest trees planted to minimise blast damage in the event of an accident, all traditional gunpowder factories were places of beauty, even during their working lives, and this one is no exception.\\n\\nGunpowder is a low explosive, best used as a propellant. Guncotton, the first high explosive, more useful for its destructive powers, was invented by Dr Christian Schonbein, of the University of Basel, in 1846. Under licence from him it was first manufactured at Faversham’s Marsh Works in 1847. Tragically, the manufacturing process was not yet fully understood. On 14 July 1847 a serious explosion killed 18 staff, only 10 of whose bodies could be identified. Due to this, the factory owners shut the plant.\\n\\nGuncotton was not made again in Faversham till 1873, when the Cotton Powder Company, independent of the gunpowder factories, opened a factory on a remote new site. Near Uplees, about 4 km northwest of the town centre but still within the parish, this was alongside the Swale, the deep-water channel that divides mainland Kent from the Isle of Sheppey. Deliveries of raw materials — cotton waste and sulphuric and nitric acids — could readily be made, and the product readily dispatched by water.\\n\\nWith a buoyant market the factory rapidly expanded, producing also each new high explosive as it was formulated. Adjoining it on the west in 1913 an associate venture, the Explosives Loading Company, built a plant to fill bombs and shells. Both plants were high-tech state-of-the-art, with a power station, hydraulic mains, and internal telephone and tramway systems. Together they occupied an area of 500 acres (2 km²) — almost as large as that of the City of London.\\n\\nWhen the First World War started in 1914, the two factories were requisitioned by the Admiralty and armed guards were mounted. Production facilities were further expanded and many new staff recruited from Faversham and elsewhere in East Kent. Road access for the workers was poor, so the Admiralty built a metre-gauge railway, the Davington Light Railway, to transport them from a terminus at Davington, near the Home Works, to Uplees.\\n\\nOn Sunday 2 April 1916, a store of TNT and ammonium nitrate (used to \"stretch\" the TNT) exploded. More than 100 staff were killed in this explosion and in other sympathetic ones that followed. It was a Sunday, so no women were at work. Fuller details of this great explosion, the worst in the history of the British explosives industry.\\n\\nThe owners of both Swale-side factories had foreseen that they would become superfluous at the end of the First World War, and they closed promptly and permanently in 1919. The Davington light railway track was lifted, and its three steam locomotives found new homes in South America, where at least one is thought to survive.\\n\\nAt 14:20 on Sunday 2 April 1916, a huge explosion ripped through the gunpowder mill at Uplees, near Faversham, when 200 tons of TNT ignited. 105 people died in the explosion, and many were buried in a mass grave at Faversham Cemetery.\\n\\nThe weather might have contributed to the origins of the fire that followed on the morning of Sunday 2 April 1916. The previous month had been wet but had ended with a short dry spell so that by that Sunday the weather was \"glorious\" ... but provided perfect conditions for heat-generated combustion. \\n\\nThe munitions factory was in a remote spot in the middle of the open marshes of North Kent, next to the Thames coastline, which explains why the great explosion at about noon on 2 April was heard across the Thames estuary as far away as Norwich, Great Yarmouth and Southend-on-Sea, where domestic windows were blown out and two large plate-glass shop windows shattered. \\n\\nThe East Kent Gazette of Sittingbourne reported the explosion on 29 April. Although recognising the need for some censorship, it referred to the reply given in Parliament to the question as \"mystifying and ambiguous\" and called for the fullest precautions to be implemented to \"prevent another calamity of the kind\" occurring again. \\n\\nAlthough not the first such disaster of this kind to have happened at Faversham’s historic munitions works, the April 1916 blast is recorded as \"the worst ever in the history of the UK explosives industry\", and yet the full picture is still somewhat confused. The reason for the fire is uncertain. And considering the quantity of explosive chemical stored at the works — with one report indicating that a further 3,000 tons remained in nearby sheds unaffected — it is remarkable, and a tribute to those who struggled against the fire that so much of the nation's munitions were prevented from contributing further to the catastrophe.\\n\\nThe Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener, had in 1914 written to the management of the CPC, and it is presumed the ELC, instructing the workforce on \"the importance of the government work upon which they (were) engaged\". \"I should like all engaged by your company to know that it is fully recognised that they, in carrying out the great work of supplying munitions of war, are doing their duty for their King and Country, equally with those who have joined the Army for active service in the field\", Kitchener said.\\n\\nThis was not quite the end of high explosives manufacture in Faversham, however. In 1924 a new venture, the Mining Explosives Company, opened a factory on the east side of Faversham Creek, not far from the site of Faversham Abbey — hence its Abbey Works name.\\n\\nIts Mexico telegraphic address led to it being known as The Mexico by local people. After a fatal accident in 1939 the proprietors decided to abandon the manufacture of high explosives and instead make an explosive-substitute based on a large reusable steel cartridge filled with carbon dioxide. The premises still needed to be licensed under the 1875 Explosives Act, as gunpowder was used in the detonator.\\n\\nUnder the name Long Airdox, production continues today. Unusually, the company is owned by its main customers. Its appearance is still that of a traditional high explosive factories, with no big buildings but many small ones widely spaced for safety. It boasts one of the UK's few surviving manumotive railways.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax", "body": "The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax () is a United States payroll (or employment) tax imposed by the federal government on both employees and employers to fund Social Security and Medicare —federal programs that provide benefits for retirees, the disabled, and children of deceased workers. Social Security benefits include old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI); Medicare provides hospital insurance benefits. The amount that one pays in payroll taxes throughout one's working career is indirectly tied to the social security benefits annuity that one receives as a retiree. This has led some to claim that the payroll tax is not a tax because its collection is tied to a benefit. The United States Supreme Court decided in Flemming v. Nestor (1960) that no one has an accrued property right to benefits from Social Security.\\n\\nThe Federal Insurance Contributions Act is currently codified at Title 26, Subtitle C, Chapter 21 of the United States Code.\\n\\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities states that three-quarters of taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. The FICA tax is considered a regressive tax on income (with no standard deduction or personal exemption deduction) and is imposed (for the years 2009 and 2010) only on the first $106,800 of gross wages. The tax is not imposed on investment income (such as interest and dividends).\\n\\nFor 2008, the employee's share of the Social Security portion of the tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit of $102,000 of compensation (resulting in a maximum of $6,324.00 in tax). For 2009 and 2010, the employee's share is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit of $106,800 of compensation (resulting in a maximum Social Security tax of $6,621.60). This limit, known as the Social Security Wage Base, goes up each year based on average national wages and, in general, at a faster rate than the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The employee's share of the Medicare portion is 1.45% of wages, with no limit on the amount of wage subject to the Medicare tax. \\n\\nThe employer is also liable for separate 6.2% and 1.45% Social Security and Medicare taxes, respectively, making the total Social Security tax 12.4%, and the total Medicare tax 2.9%, of wages. (Self-employed people are responsible for the entire FICA percentage of 15.3% (= 12.4% + 2.9%), since they are in a sense both the employer and the employed; however, see the section on self-employed people for more details.)\\n\\nIf a worker starts a new job halfway through the year and has already earned the wage base limit for Social Security purposes, the new employer is not allowed to stop withholding until the wage base limit has been earned with the new employer. There are some limited cases, such as a successor-predecessor transfer, in which the payments that have already been withheld can be counted toward the year-to-date total.\\n\\nIf a worker has overpaid toward Social Security by having more than one job or by having switched jobs during the year, that worker can file a request to have that overpayment counted as tax paid when he or she files a Federal income tax return. If the taxpayer is due a refund, then the FICA overpayment becomes part or all of the refund.\\n\\nA tax similar to the FICA tax is imposed on the earnings of self-employed individuals, such as independent contractor and members of a partnership. This tax is imposed not by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act but instead by the Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954, which is codified as Chapter 2 of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code,  through  (the \"SE Tax Act\"). Under the SE Tax Act, self-employed people are responsible for the entire percentage of 15.3% (= 12.4% [Soc. Sec.] + 2.9% [Medicare]); however, the 15.3% multiplier is applied to 92.35% of the business's net earnings from self-employment, rather than 100% of the gross earnings; the difference, 7.65%, is half of the 15.3%, and makes the calculation fair in comparison to that of regular (non-self-employed) employees. It does this by adjusting for the fact that employees' 7.65% share of their SE tax is multiplied against a number (their gross income) that does not include the putative \"employer's half\" of the self-employment tax. In other words, it makes the calculation fair because employees don't get taxed on their employers' contribution of the second half of FICA, therefore self-employed people shouldn't get taxed on the second half of the self-employment tax. Similarly, self-employed people also deduct half of their self-employment tax (schedule SE) from their gross income on the way to arriving at their adjusted gross income (AGI). This levels the amount paid by self-employed persons in comparison to regular employees, who don't pay general income tax on their employers' contribution of the second half of FICA, just as they didn't pay FICA tax on it either.\\n\\nThese calculations are made on Schedule SE: Self-Employment Tax, although that is not readily apparent to novice self-employed taxpayers, owing to the schedule's rather opaque name, which makes it sound like it is part of the general federal income tax. Some taxpayers have complained that Schedule SE's title should be changed to something such as \"Self-Employment FICA Tax\", so that its separateness from the general income tax is apparent, perhaps not realizing that the SE tax is not imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) at all, and that neither SE taxes nor FICA taxes are \"income taxes\" imposed under Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.\\n\\nA special case in FICA regulations includes exemptions for student workers. Students enrolled at least half-time in a university and working part-time for the same university are exempted from FICA payroll taxes, so long as their relationship with the university is primarily an educational one.\\n\\nPrior to the Great Depression, the following presented difficulties for working-class Americans:\\n\\nIn the 1930s, the New Deal introduced Social Security to rectify the first three problems (retirement, injury-induced disability, or congenital disability). It introduced the FICA tax as the means to pay for Social Security.\\n\\nIn the 1960s, Medicare was introduced to rectify the fourth problem (health care for the elderly). The FICA tax was increased in order to pay for this expense.\\n\\nThe Social Security component of the FICA tax has been called regressive, meaning the effective tax rate regresses (decreases) as income increases. The Social Security component is actually a flat tax for wage levels under the Social Security Wage Base (see \"Regular\" employees above). But since no tax is owed on wages above the Wage Base limit, the tax rate effectively declines as wages increase beyond that limit. In other words, for wage levels above the limit, the absolute dollar amount of tax owed remains constant; since this number (the numerator) remains constant while the wage level (the denominator) increases, the effective tax rate steadily decreases as wage levels increase beyond the Wage Base limit.\\n\\nFICA is also not collected on unearned income, including interest on savings deposits, stock dividends, and capital gains such as profits from the sale of stock or real estate. The proportion of total income which is exempt from FICA as \"unearned income\" tends to rise with higher income brackets.\\n\\nSome argue that since Social Security taxes are eventually returned to taxpayers, with interest, in the form of Social Security benefits, the regressiveness of the tax is effectively negated—i.e., the taxpayer gets back what he or she put into the Social Security system. Others, including the Congressional Budget Office, argue that the Social Security system as a whole is progressive-- i.e., individuals with lower lifetime average wages receive a larger benefit (as a percentage of their lifetime average wage income) than do individuals with higher lifetime average wages.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Federal Theatre Project", "body": "thumbthumb\\n\\nThe Federal Theatre Project (FTP) was a New Deal project to fund theatre and other live artistic performances in the United States during the Great Depression. It was one of five Federal One projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The FTP's primary goal was employment of out-of-work artists, writers, and directors, with the secondary aim of entertaining poor families and creating relevant art.\\n\\nThe FTP was established August 27, 1935, after a legislative and administrative prologue. Hallie Flanagan, a theater professor at Vassar, was chosen by WPA head Harry Hopkins to lead the FTP. She was given the daunting task of building a national theater program to employ thousands of unemployed artists in as little time as possible. Hopkins added to the difficulty of her job by promising the FTP would be \"free, adult, and uncensored.\" At the time, this statement appeared to FTP directors as a green light to all FTP projects, regardless of their political or social content. Soon, however it would come back to haunt Hopkins, Flanagan and the FTP as a whole.\\n\\nLiving Newspaper were plays written by teams of researchers-turned-playwrights. These men and women clipped articles from newspapers about current events, often hot button issues like farm policy, syphilis testing, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and housing inequity. These newspaper clippings were adapted into plays intended to inform audiences, often with progressive or left-wing themes. Triple-A Plowed Under, for instance, attacked the U.S. Supreme Court for killing an aid agency for farmers. These politically-themed plays quickly drew criticism from members of Congress.\\n\\nAlthough the undisguised political invective in the Living Newspapers sparked controversy, they also proved popular with audiences. As an art form, the Living Newspaper is perhaps the FTP's most well-known work.\\n\\nProblems with the FTP and Congress intensified when the State Department objected to the first Living Newspaper, Ethiopia, about Haile Selassie and his nation's struggles against Benito Mussolini's invading Italian forces. The U.S. government soon mandated that the FTP, a federal government agency, could not depict foreign heads of state on the stage, for fear of diplomatic backlash. Playwright and director Elmer Rice, head of the New York office of the FTP, resigned in protest.\\n\\nMany of the notable artists of the time participated in the FTP, including Susan Glaspell who served as Midwest Bureau Director. The legacy of the FTP can also be found in a new generation of theater artists whose careers began with the FTP. Arthur Miller, Orson Welles, John Houseman, Martin Ritt, Elia Kazan, Joseph Losey, Marc Blitzstein, Arthur Arent and Abe Feder all became established, in part, through their work in the FTP. Blitzstein, Houseman and Welles collaborated on the controversial FTP production of The Cradle Will Rock.\\n\\nThe FTP was the most expensive of the Federal One projects, consuming 29.1 percent of Federal One's budget. (However, this budget was less than three-fourths of one percent of the total WPA budget.)\\n\\nOn June 30, 1939, the FTP was ended when its funding was canceled, largely attributed to strong Congressional objections to the overtly left-wing political tones of many FTP productions.\\n\\nThe Negro Theatre Project (NTP) was part of the Federal Theatre Project (FTP) and had units that were set up in cities throughout the United States. The units were located in four different geographical regions of the country. In the West, units were located in Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles, California.In the East,units were located in New York City, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, Hartford, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Newark, New Jersey. In the South, there were units in Raleigh, North Carolina, Durham, North Carolina, and Birmingham, Alabama. In the Midwest, units were located in Chicago, Illinois, Peoria, Illinois, and Cleveland, Ohio. The project provided employment and apprenticeships to black playwrights, directors, actors, and technicians. The project offered a much needed source of assistance for African American theatre from 1935 to 1939.\\n\\nThe New York Negro Unit was active and well known. It was located at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem, and staged some 30 plays. The most popular production was the Haitian, or “voodoo,” Macbeth (1935), an adaptation of Shakespeare’s play set in the Caribbean and directed by Orson Welles. Other plays included Frank Wilson’s folk drama Walk Together, Children (1936), which described the deportation of 100 African American children from the South to the North to work for low wages. Arna Bontemps and Countee Cullen’s The Conjur Man Dies (1936), was a farcical mystery that dramatized Rudolph Fisher’s mystery-melodrama. Also in 1936, J. Augustus Smith and Peter Morrell co-authored Turpentine, a social drama focusing on the injustice of Southern labor camps. George MacEntee's The Case of Philip Lawrence (1937) was a courtroom melodrama and Haiti (1938) by William Dubois, was a historical drama about overthrowing the Haitian government.\\n\\nA lightly fictionalized version of the FTP's story is presented in the 1999 film \"Cradle Will Rock\".\\n\\nSchwartz, Bonnie Nelson.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against the plaintiffs.\\n\\nThe Center for Constitutional Rights and the Humanitarian Law Project took up a similar case challenging the AEDPA and the USA PATRIOT Act in 2003. In March 2004, Judge Audrey Collins enjoined the US Government from enforcing applicable sections of the USA Patriot Act against the plaintiffs; however, FeTNA was not covered by the ruling, because they did not provide the court with adequate details to prove that their proposed actions—doing cultural work in LTTE-occupied parts of Sri Lanka—would actually be in violation of the law.\\n\\nSome critics of the LTTE, consider FeTNA overly sympathetic toward or supportive of the group. FeTNA's public statements are primarily critical of human rights abuses attributed to the government of Sri Lanka, rather than those attributed to the LTTE.\\n\\nA July 2003 Times of India article based on a prior article in Sri Lankan paper The Island called FeTNA \"one of LTTE's front organisations,\" and referred to the annual FeTNA convention as an LTTE fundraiser. (The Island is editorially critical of the LTTE, and some of its Tamil critics point to a 1999 Asian Human Rights Commission statement that called it \"a Sri Lankan newspaper well known for its racist propaganda.\") The accusation appears not to have been repeated in subsequent media coverage, and mainstream Indian political figures (e.g. Indian President Abdul Kalam) have continued to participate in FeTNA events.\\n\\nFeTNA was actively involved in the Californian Hindu textbook controversy, in which it joined a number of other groups in successfully petitioning California's Curriculum Commission to reject allegedly revisionist edits to California's textbook curriculum on Hinduism and India, as suggested by the Hindu Education Foundation and the Vedic Foundation. FeTNA raised several specific objections about the proposed textbook revisions, which they felt sidelined the role of South Indian and Dravidian culture (history, language, and religious traditions), and allegedly \"whitewashed\" caste and gender discrimination in India. (See main article Californian Hindu textbook controversy for details.)\\n\\nUpon rejection by the Board of major proposed edits, a jubilant Thillai Kumaran, then President of FeTNA, dismissed the pending lawsuit by the Hindu organizations. “Threats of legal action are a clear sign of desperation on the part of the Sangh organizations; these organizations are perhaps not aware that the Board deals with dozens of lawsuits at any given time and cannot be cowed by such threats.” . Thillai Kumaran, a concerned parent, mentioned his lower-caste origins during his testimony, mentioned that his son, who attend Middle School in California, did not feel insulted by the textbook's contents on Hinduism.\\n\\nIn a statement FeTNA has supported caste-based reservation in India to 49.5% of the available seats in institutes of higher education and jobs. It has been critical of the demonstration again the proposed increased in reserved seats. The Tamil Nadu state of India already reserves 69% seats for specific castes.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fedir Bohatyrchuk", "body": "Fedir Parfenovych Bohatyrchuk (also Bogatirchuk, Bohatirchuk, Bogatyrtschuk) (in Ukrainian : Федір Парфенович Богатирчук, Fedir Parfenovych Bohatyrchuk; in Russian : Фёдор Парфеньевич Богатырчук, Fiodor Parfen'evitch Bogatyrchuk) (born 14 November 1892 in Kiev, Ukraine - died 4 September 1984, Ottawa, Canada) was a Ukrainian-Canadian International Master of chess, and an International Master of correspondence chess. He also was a doctor of medicine (radiologist), a political activist, and a chess writer.\\n\\nAs a youth, Bohatyrchuk sometimes traveled to chess tournaments with the great Mikhail Chigorin (1850–1908), who had earlier lost a match for the World Championship to Wilhelm Steinitz. Chigorin trained the young player, and influenced his style and openings. \\n\\nIn 1911, Bohatyrchuk won, followed by Stefan Izbinsky, Efim Bogoljubov, etc., at Kiev. In February 1914, he lost an exhibition game against Jose Raul Capablanca at Kiev. In 1914, he took 3rd at Kiev. In July/August 1914, he tied for 6th–10th at Mannheim (the 19th DSB Congress, Hauptturnier A). Bohatyrchuk, along with 10 other \"Russian\" players from the interrupted Mannheım tournament, was interned by Germany after the declaration of war against Russia, which began World War I. In September 1914, Bohatyrchuk and three others (Alexander Alekhine, Saburov, and Koppelman) were freed and allowed to return home.\\n\\nBohatyrchuk played in six USSR Chess Championship: 1923, 1924, 1927, 1931, 1933, and 1934. In July 1923, he tied for 3rd–5th at Petrograd (St Petersburg, Leningrad) at 2nd USSR Championship. In 1924, he took 2nd, behind Vilner, at Kiev (1st Ukrainian SSR Ch.). In August–September 1924, he tied for 3rd–4th at Moscow (3rd USSR Ch.). \\n\\nIn December 1925, he took 11th of 21 at Moscow (1st IT). The event was won by Efim Bogoljubov, followed by Emanuel Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, Frank Marshall, etc. It was the first Soviet government-sponsored tournament, and had 11 of the world's top 16 players, based on ratings from chessmetrics.com. Bohatyrchuk scored a 2628 performance, according to chessmetrics. \\n\\nIn 1926, Bohatyrchuk wrote the first chess book \"Szachy\" (Shakhy, Шахи) in Ukrainian. In 1927, he won at Kiev. In October 1927, he tied for 1st–2nd with Peter Romanovsky at Moscow (5th USSR Ch.). His peak chessmetrics.com rating was in October 1927 at 2629, good for 15th place in the world. In 1929, he won at Kiev. \\n\\nIn November 1931, he tied for 3rd–6th at Moscow (7th USSR Ch.), with 10/17, as Mikhail Botvinnik won. In 1933, he won at Moscow (Quadrangular), with 4.5/6. In September 1933, he took 8th at Leningrad (8th USSR Ch.), with 10.5/19, as Botvinnik won again. In December 1934 /January 1935, he tied for 3rd–4th at Leningrad (9th USSR Ch.), with 11.5/19, just half a point behind the joint winners Grigory Levenfish and Ilya Rabinovich. \\n\\nIn March 1935, he tied for 16th–17th at Moscow (2nd IT), with 8/19. The event, which had 8 of the world's top 18 players, according to chessmetrics, was won by Botvinnik and Salo Flohr, but Bohatyrchuk beat Mikhail Botvinnik in their individual game. Bohatyrchuk has mentioned in his autobiography (printed in Russian in San Francisco in 1978) that just after this game the head of the Soviet chess delegation, Minister of Justice Nikolai Krylenko, approached him and said: \"You will never beat Botvinnik again!\" That was indeed the case as Bohatyrchuk never played Botvinnik again, leaving him with a lifetime score of (+3 =1 –0) against Botvinnik.\\n\\nIn March 1936, he took 3rd at Kiev (8th Ukrainian SSR Ch.), with 11.5/17. In July 1937, he won at Kiev (the 9th Ukrainian Chess Championship), with 12.5/17. In 1938, he took 2nd at Kiev (USSR Ch. semi-final), with 11/17, behind only winner Vasily Panov, but he did not play at the 11th USSR Championship in 1939.\\n\\nBohatyrchuk completed his high school studies in 1912, and entered the University of Kiev later that year to study medicine. During the Russian Civil War, he was employed by a military hospital, and was a professor of anatomy at the Institute of Physical Education and Sport in Kiev.\\n\\nAs a radiologist and medical doctor in 1940, Bohatyrchuk was seconded to a German medical research facility when Kiev fell to the Nazi armies in September 1941. During World War II, he was a head of the Ukrainian Red Cross, and the Institute of Experimental Medicine. While working with the Red Cross, Bohatyrchuk did a lot to help the Soviet prisoners of war kept in the German camps in extremely harsh conditions. These activities irritated the Germans, and in February 1942 Bohatyrchuk was arrested and spent about a month in a Gestapo detention centre in Kiev. There also exists information that, while working at the Institute of Experimental Medicine, Bohatyrchuk provided a cover to a Jewish female employee (a sister of the Kiev chess player Boris Ratner), thereby saving her from execution or deportation to a ghetto. At a later stage of the War, though, Bohatyrchuk became a Nazi collaborator. When the Soviet army pushed the Germans from Kiev, Bohatyrchuk, together with his family, migrated to Cracow, then Prague, in 1944. There he joined the Committee for Freedom of Peoples in Russia, a Nazi-sponsored, semi-military organization headed by the Nazi collaborationist Russian general Andrey Vlasov. (Vlasov's troops participated in the hostilities, on the German side.) Bohatyrchuk was also the leader of the Ukrainian National Council (Ukrainśka Narodna Rada), another Nazi-sponsored project. As a result of these activities, Bohatyrchuk was the number one \"persona non grata\" in Soviet chess until the defection of Viktor Korchnoi. The Soviets removed many of his games from their official records, but many of them were later reclaimed using outside sources.\\n\\nIn February 1944, he took 2nd, behind Efim Bogoljubow, at Radom (the 5th General Government chess tournament). In Spring 1944, he drew a match against Stepan Popel at Cracow (2 : 2). In May 1944, Bohatyrchuk played an 8-game training series against local players (Čeněk Kottnauer, Ludek Pachman, Podgorny, Prucha, etc.) at Prague (+7 =1 –0). \\n\\nAt the end of WW II, as the German armies were retreating, Bohatyrchuk moved to a number of cities including Berlin and Potsdam, and finally ended up in the American-controlled city of Bayreuth in May 1945. For a time he lived in Munich, playing in German chess events under the name of 'Bogenhols' ('Bogenko'), so as to avoid repatriation to the USSR. In 1946, he won, followed by Elmārs Zemgalis, Wolfgang Unzicker, etc. at Regensburg (Klaus Junge Memorial), with 7/9. In February 1947, he took 3rd at Kirchheim-Teck. In September 1947, he took 4th at Stuttgart.\\n\\nAfter the end of World War II, the USA, UK, and Canada chose to give asylum to numerous Nazi collaborators from Eastern Europe. Canada became a safe heaven for many Ukrainian collaborators. These policies were dictated by the exigencies of the Cold War, specifically by a hope to use some of these people in case the Cold War were to switch into a hot phase. Also, many of the immigrants had advanced scientific knowledge, which was of interest to the western powers.\\n\\nThese policies enabled Bohatyrchuk to emigrate to Canada in 1948, where he became a professor at the University of Ottawa, and the author of many scientific studies and recollection books. At the congress of the Ukrainian federalists in Niagara Falls in 1952, he was elected Chairman of the association of the Ukrainian federalist Democrats, and chief editor of the last press organs \"Skhidnyak\" and the \"federalist Democrat\". He is the author of many newspaper and periodical articles on the history of ODNR (Liberation Movement of Peoples of Russia), and books like \"My living way with Vlasov and Manifesto of Prague\" (San Francisco, 1978) (in Russian: Мой жизненный путь к Власову и Пражскому Манифесту, Moy zhiznennyi put' k Vlasovu i Prazhskomu Manifestu). In his publications, Bohatyrchuk never apologized for his collaboration with the Nazis, and tried to expose the Nazi-sponsored \"Vlasov movement\" merely as an alternative to Stalinism. \\n\\nHe played in three Closed Canadian Chess Championship. In 1949, he took 2nd at Arvida (winner was Maurice Fox), with 7/9, ahead of Daniel Yanofsky, Frank Anderson, and Povilas Vaitonis. In 1951, he tied for 3rd-4th places at Vancouver (winner was Povilas Vaitonis), with 8.5/12. In 1955, he tied for 3rd–5th at Ottawa (winner was Frank Anderson, ahead of Daniel Yanofsky). Bohatyrchuk also represented Canada at the 11th Chess Olympiad at Amsterdam 1954, playing board four (+7 =3 –5). In 1954 FIDE granted him the title of International Master. His earlier achievements, particularly in USSR Championships, may have been sufficient for the higher Grandmaster title, but the Soviets blocked this for political reasons. In his seventies he took up Correspondence chess, becoming Canadian Correspondence Chess Champion (1963, 1964) and playing 1st board for Canada at the Correspondence Chess Olympiad (1962–1965). Since 1967 he was ICCF International Master. Bohatyrchuk stayed active in local Ottawa chess into his early eighties, and played correspondence chess until age 85. \\n\\nWhile living in Ottawa, Bohatyrchuk helped to train the young Lawrence Day (born 1949), who himself became a FIDE International Master in 1972, and who went on to represent Canada a record 13 times at Chess Olympiads. Day's chess style has been influenced significantly by Bohatyrchuk.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fedot Alekseyev Popov", "body": "thumbFedot Alekseyevich Popov (, also Fedot Alekseyev, ; nickname Kholmogorian, , for his place of birth (Kholmogory), date of birth unknown, died between 1648 and 1654) was a Russian explorer who organized the first European expedition through the Bering Strait.\\n\\nHe was normally known as Fedot Alekseyev. Only a few sources call him the son of Popov. He was from Kholmogory and the agent of Alexey Usov who was a member of the Gostinaya Sotnya, the highest merchant guild in Moscow. (Some time between 1647 and 1653 Usov petitioned to have Fedot apprehended on the grounds that Usov had sent him to Siberia with 3,500 rubles worth of goods and he had not reported back for eight years.) He went to Siberia in 1639. Moving east, he was at Tyumen, Tobolsk, Tomsk, Yeniseisk (1641) and Yakutsk(1642). In 1642 he joined a group of about 100 men under Ivan Rebrov who went down the Lena to the sea and up the Olenyok River to the west. Fedot had 29 men under him. Two years later they were defeated by the local Tungus and fled down the river. Fedot and some of his companions sailed east to the Kolyma River.\\n\\nWhen he arrived at Srednekolymsk in 1645 he had 12 men with him and, probably, his Yakut concubine. Hearing of a rich 'Pogycha River' somewhere to the east, he organized an expedition to find it. Since he was not a service-man, Semyon Dezhnev was called in as the official leader. In June 1647 he sailed down the river to the Arctic with 50 men in four koches but they were forced to turn back due to thick ice. Next year they tried again. For a fuller account see Semyon Dezhnev. Sometime in September he rounded the northeastern tip of Asia and entered the Pacific Ocean. On September 20, 1648 (old style, September 30 in our calendar) he was wounded in a fight with the Chukchis. About the first of October (o.s) a storm separated Fedot's and Dezhnev's boats and we lose track of him. In 1653/54 Dezhnev captured his Yakut woman from the Koryaks. She said that Fedot died of scurvy, some of his companions were killed by the Koryaks and the rest fled in small boats to an unknown fate. From the location of the woman's capture, it is likely that his boat was wrecked somewhere not far south of Anadyr Estuary.\\n\\nDezhnev is usually called the first European to reach the Bering Strait since he was the formal leader and left most of the documents, but Fedot Alexeyev organized the expedition and may have been more important than the few surviving documents indicate.\\n\\nThe Fedotov Legend: When, in 1697, Vladimir Atlasov reached Kamchatka, he heard that other Russians had been there first. The natives said that a certain 'Fedotov' and his men had lived on the Nikul River, a tributary to the Kamchatka River, and had married local women. The ruins of their huts could still be seen. The natives thought they were gods or demons and left them alone, but when they saw one Russian kill another, they changed their minds. The Russians were attacked and fled, some going west to the sea of Okhotsk. All were killed, some by the Kamchadals, some by the Koryaks.\\n\\nSo who was Fedotov? There have been four answers: 1)Gerhardt Friedrich Müller thought he was probably Fedot's son, but offered no evidence. 2)Stepan Krasheninnikov thought he was Fedot himself and tried to reconcile this with the Yakut woman's story. Other versions of Fedotov=Fedot have been tried. 3) He may have been one of the lost men from the Dezhnev or some other expedition. In Siberia at this time there was a Vas'ka Fedotov, a few people who used Fedotov as a patronymic and various Fedors and so on whose names could have been garbled. 4) He was some other Russian who does not appear in the surviving records. About all we can say is that some Russians reached Kamchatka in the second half of the 17th century and died there. Who they were is a matter of speculation.\\n\\nRaymond H Fisher, The Voyage of Semen Dezhnev in 1648, The Hakluyt Society, 1981.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Felipe Rodríguez", "body": "Luis Felipe Rodriguez, better known as Felipe \"La Voz\" Rodríguez, (May 8, 1926– May 26, 1999) born in Caguas, Puerto Rico, was a singer of bolero. He is regarded as the most popular Puerto Rican male singer of the 1950s based on record sales and live audience records. Many of Rodríguez's recordings are often considered to be classics in Puerto Rico.\\n\\nRodríguez was born in the Savarona section of Caguas, the son of a sharecropper and a midwife. He had a rough childhood; his father died before he was born. In 1930, his mother Carmen moved to Santurce and settled in Barrio Obrero, a working class district of San Juan. There Rodriguez went to school and practiced his singing skills during his free time. Julito Rodriguez (no relation to Felipe), another bolero singer, heard Rodriguez sing and invited him to form a singing duo; they later they formed a trio called \"Los Romanceros\" (The Romantics) and he first took part in a radio program, the popular amateur showcase \"Tribuna del Arte\", hosted and produced by Rafael Quiñones Vidal.\\n\\nIn 1950, Rodriguez left the trio and tried different projects, such as forming or joining other trios (particularly the Trío Los Antares), duos (he formed the \"Dúo Pérez-Rodríguez\" with his then wife, and continued his professional relationship with her long after their divorce) and singing solo. He was given the nickname, \"La Voz\" (The Voice), a name which was to stay with him for the rest of his life, by Puerto Rican radio announcer Mariano Artau. Héctor Lavoe's stage name was based on Rodríguez's nickname.\\n\\nRodriguez went on tour in the United States where he broke the previous attendance and ticket records set for the Hispanic audience by Argentine singer Libertad Lamarque. In 1954, Rodriguez met Pedro Ortiz Davila \"Davilita\" and formed a very successful duo performing in such places as the Teatro Puerto Rico. Even though \"Davilita\"'s voice was not as sharp as it was when he was younger, they were able to have many hits together, particularly the Pedro Flores song \"La Rosa Blanca\" (The White Rose). In the 1960s, they, together with Rafael Cortijo and El Gran Combo confronted the new wave of rock music which was invading the island head-on.\\n\\nIn 1965, Rodriguez became the first Puerto Rican to sing the Puerto Rican national anthem, La Borinqueña, at a sporting event, celebrated at Madison Square Garden in New York City, where fellow Puerto Rican Jose Luis \"Chegui\" Torres] won the World . Light Heavyweight [[boxing title in a fight against Willie Pastrano which was televised coast to coast in the United States. Rodríguez, as a matter of fact, was an amateur boxer in his youth, was an occasional referee at amateur boxing matches, and was a scout for young boxing talent.\\n\\nBack in Puerto Rico, Rodriguez landed his own radio program at radio station WITA-AM in San Juan, called \"Éste es tu disco\" (This is your Record). In 1973, Rodriguez and Davilita paired again to record \"Canciones de Pedro Flores\" and in 1974, \"Canciones de Rafael Hernández\". Also in 1974, Felipe Rodriguez, Davilita and Pellin Rodríguez (no relation to Felipe) recorded a trilogy which also are considered as Christmas classics in Puerto Rico. These were \"La Protesta de los Reyes\" (The Protest of the Wisemen), \"Parranda parrandera\" and \"Navidad\" (Christmas).\\n\\nIn 1952, he recorded the following songs:\\n\\nall of which became hits and are now considered as classics in Puerto Rico.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, Rodriguez continued to record and had hits with \"Por Primera Vez\" (1983) (For the First Time) and \"Juntos otra Vez\" (1986) (Together Again). In 1987, he was able to realize one of his dreams when he performed at the Luis A. Ferre Center for Performing Arts in San Juan.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, Rodriguez continued to be active as a singer and when not singing he would be at the recording studio producing. He suffered a fall from a step ladder in his Carolina, P.R. home, which hurt his back. Eventually the fall complicated with a pneumonia and contributed to his death. Felipe \"La Voz\" Rodriguez died on May 26, 1999 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\\n\\nThe city of Caguas named the main auditorium of its own Center for Performing Arts as the Felipe Rodriguez Hall. A book written by music historian Pedro Malavet Vega \"La Vellonera esta directa\" has been written, chiefly about Rodriguez's life, and using his career trajectory as a backdrop and timetable for many other cultural and sociological events that occurred in Puerto Rico between the late 1940s and early 1960s.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Felony", "body": "A felony is a serious crime in the common law countries. The term originates from English common law where felonies were originally crimes which involved the confiscation of a convicted person's land and goods; other crimes were called misdemeanor. Many common law countries have now abolished the felony/misdemeanor distinction and replaced it with other distinctions such as between indictable offence and summary offence.\\n\\nA person convicted in a court of law of a felony crime is known as a felon. In the United States, where the felony/misdemeanor distinction is still widely applied, the federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or less, it is classified as a misdemeanor.\\n\\nSimilar to felonies in some civil law countries (Italy, Spain etc.) are delict, whereas in others (France, Belgium, Switzerland etc.) crimes (more serious) and delicts (less serious).\\n\\nCrimes commonly considered to be felonies include, but are not limited to: aggravated assault and/or battery, arson, burglary, illegal drug use/sales, grand theft, robbery, murder, rape, and vandalism on federal property. Broadly, felonies can be categorized as either violent or non-violent (property and drug) offenses.\\n\\nSome offenses, though similar in nature, may be felonies or misdemeanors depending on the circumstances. For example, the illegal manufacture, distribution or possession of controlled substances may be a felony, although possession of small amounts may be only a misdemeanor. Possession of a deadly weapon may be generally legal, but carrying the same weapon into a restricted area such as a school may be viewed as a serious offense, regardless of whether there is intent to use the weapon.\\n\\nIn some states, felonies are also classified (class A, B, etc.) according to their seriousness and punishment. In New York State, the classes of felonies are E, D, C, B, A-II, and A-I (the most severe). Others class felonies numerically, e.g., capital, life, 1st degree, 2nd degree, 3rd degree, state jail or class 1, 2, etc. (VA). The number of classifications and the corresponding crimes vary by state and are determined by the legislature. Usually, the legislature also determines the maximum punishment allowable for each felony class; this avoids the necessity of defining specific sentences for every possible crime.\\n\\nA felony may be punishable with imprisonment for one or more years or death in the case of the most serious felonies, such as murder. Indeed, at common law when the British and American legal systems divorced in 1776, felonies were crimes for which the punishment was either death or forfeiture of property. In modern times, felons can receive punishments which range in severity; from probation, to imprisonment, to execution for premeditated murder or other serious crimes.\\n\\nThe reform of harsh felony laws that had originated in Great Britain was deemed \"one of the first fruits of liberty\" after the United States became independent.\\n\\nIn many parts of the United States, a convicted felon can face long-term legal consequences persisting after the end of their imprisonment, including:\\n\\nAdditionally, most job applications ask about felony history, and answering dishonestly on them can be grounds for rejecting the application, or termination if the lie is discovered after hire. Many bonding companies will not issue bonds to convicted felons, effectively barring them from certain jobs. Many banks will not lend to convicted felons.\\n\\nSome states also consider a felony conviction to be grounds for an uncontested divorce.\\n\\nThe status and designation as a \"convicted felon\" is considered permanent, and is not extinguished upon sentence completion even if parole, probation or early release was given. The status can only be cleared by a successful appeal or executive clemency. However, felons may be able to apply for restoration of some rights after a certain period of time has passed.\\n\\nFor state law convictions, expungement is determined by the law of the state. A few states do not allow expungement, regardless of the offense.\\n\\nFederal law does not have any provisions for persons convicted of federal felonies in a federal United States district court to apply to have their record expunged. While the pending Second Chance Act which may change this, at present the only relief that an individual prosecuted in Federal Court may receive is a Presidential Pardon, which does not expunge the conviction, but rather grants relief from the civil disabilities that stem from it.\\n\\n"}

He is best known as conciliator of classical Persian poetry at one side with the New Poetry initiated by Nima Yushij at the other side. One of the major contributions of Moshiri's poetry is the broadening of the social and geographical scope of modern Persian literature.\\n\\nFereydoon Moshiri was born in Tehran to a family known for their legacy of poetry. His school years were divided between Tehran and Mashhad where his father held administrative posts. \\n\\nWith the outbreak of the World War II the family moved to Tehran and the young Moshiri continued his education at Dar ol-Fonoon and then in Adib High School. Throughout these years his first poems appeared in progressive journals such as Iran-e-Ma. This was the beginning of a career in literary journalism that continued for more than thirty years. In 1946 Moshiri joined the Iranian Department of Telecommunication where he served till retirement. In 1954 Moshiri married Eghbal Akhavan, then an art student at Tehran University.

{"title": "Fermoy", "body": "Fermoy () is a town in County Cork, Ireland. It is situated on the River Blackwater in the south of Ireland. Its populations is some 5,800 inhabitants, environs included (2006 census).\\n\\nThe town's name comes from the Irish and refers to a Cistercian abbey founded in the 13th century. At the dissolution of the monasteries during the Tudor period, the abbey and its lands passed through the following dynasties: 'Sir Richard Grenville, Robert Boyle and William Forward. However, the site could hardly have been regarded as a town and, by the late 18th century, was little more than a few cabins and an inn.\\n\\nThe Christian Brothers and the Presentation and Loreto Sisters maintain a presence in the town. \\n\\nFermoy is twinned with the French commune Ploemeur in Brittany. thumb\\n\\nIn 1791, the lands around Fermoy were bought by a Scotsman, John Anderson. He was an entrepreneur who developed the roads and started the mail coach system in Ireland. He designed the town and the streets remain much the same as they were originally built. His descendants, now living in Australia, have named a wine after the town which he established. A plaque and bust in his honour were unveiled by the town park in 2001.Fermoy was the site of a major British Army barracks, when Ireland was under imperial rule. By the 1830s this was the largest military establishment on the island of Ireland. In 1797, when the army was looking to establish a new and permanent base, Anderson gifted them the land as an inducement to locate in Fermoy. Anderson and the town received considerable economic benefit from the arrangement. In 1806 the first permanent barracks, the East Barracks, were built. They were located on 16½ acres of land and provided accommodation for 112 officers and 1478 men of infantry, and 24 officers, 120 men, and 112 horses of cavalry. A general military hospital of 130 beds was also built. In 1809 West Barracks was built. This also had a 42 bed hospital. When both barracks were complete there was accommodation for 14 field officers, 169 officers, 2,816 men, and 152 horses. The town of Fermoy expanded around these facilities and retained its British military facilities until 1922, when the Irish Free State was first established.During the War of Independence, Fermoy was the scene of the first attack for arms by the IRA against British troops, during which Private Jones was killed. This resulted in several reprisals, most notably when British troops looted and burned part of the town centre. One of those who led the raid, IRA Commandant Michael Fitzgerald, was subsequently captured but never tried for the offence. He later became the first IRA man to die on hunger strike during the War of Independence.\\n\\nIndustries in and around the town include chemical production (by Micro Bio), ice-cream manufacturing (by Silver Pail), and power product manufacturing (by Anderson Power). The town's industry also includes electronics manufacturing - with companies like Sanmina-SCI Corporation and FCI Connectors. However in recent years FCI Connectors announced it would be ceasing manufacturing in their Fermoy Plant.\\n\\nMoorepark Research Institute, near Fermoy, is one of the Irish Government's agricultural and food research institutes.\\n\\nSt. Colman's College is one of the best-known local secondary schools. Loreto Convent, Coláiste an Chraobhín and Gaelscoil de hÍde are also located in the town.\\n\\nThe Blackwater river is one the town's major attractions and is very popular for its salmon and coarse fishing. The scenic river-side walk at Barnane is considered to be one of the town's most attractive amenities. The town's two annual regattas- usually in early May and early September- are hosted by Fermoy Rowing Club and serve to attract over a thousand visitors each day. Fermoy Rowing Club celebrated its 125th Anniversary in 2009 and Fermoy Regatta, by coincidence, celebrated its 70th Anniversary in the same year.This anniversary was marked by a visit to Fermoy Rowing Club by the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese.\\n\\nSince 2006, members of Fermoy Rowing Club and members of several of the local Angling clubs have been involved in an on-going campaign against the Irish Government's controversial plan to radically alter the town's historic weir. \\n\\nIn December 2009 the Minister of State for Natural Resources, Conor Lenihan TD, gave the owners of Fermoy Weir, Fermoy Town Council, a year to repair the damaged fish pass at the heart of the structure.\\n\\nthumbFor many years the main N8 Cork–Dublin road ran through Fermoy, and the town's bridge was a major bottle neck on the route. However, the M8 motorway bypass, which included a new bridge over the Munster Blackwater to the east of the town was opened in late 2006. The former N8 through the town is now a regional road, the R639, and Fermoy's traffic problems have been greatly eased. The town used to be connected to the Irish railway system, on a line from Mallow to Waterford, with a junction to nearby Mitchelstown (see Irish railway history). Fermoy railway station opened on 17 May 1860, and finally closed on 27 March 1967.The nearest airport is Cork Airport\\n\\nA number of bus services serve the area, with the Bus Eireann service to Cork and Dublin calling at Fermoy, whilst the Aircoach service to Dublin Airport also calls here.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fernandino peoples", "body": "'''\\n\\nNamed in reverence of the Portuguese explorer Fernão do Pó who is given credit for discovering their indigenous and adopted homelands, Fernandinos are creole, multi-ethnic or multi-race populations of Equatorial Guinea and former Spanish Guinea. Each population hails from a distinct ethnic, social, cultural and linguistic history. Members of these communities were responsible for building and expanding the cocoa farming industry on Fernando Po during the 1880s and 1890s. The Fernandinos of Fernando Po were closely related to each other as well as to members of communities in Freetown, Cape Coast, and Lagos. Eventually, these distinct groups integrated, and in present-day Bioko their differences barely exist.\\n\\nThe indigenous group of Fernandinos or Los Fernandinos, were mixed race descendants of the pre-existing indigenous population of Spanish Guinea originating from the island of Fernando Pó (modern day Bioko Island), an island discovered by Fernão do Pó. This group consisted of mulattos of female Bubi and white male Spaniard parentage, and were part of the Emancipados social class. Incidentally, many offspring born to this type of union were not claimed by the father; however some couples did marry under Roman Catholic law. It was not uncommon for offspring of such unions to be accepted into the indigenous tribe, and identify as such. \\n\\nSimilarly, the Portuguese-Indigenous descended mulatto population of São Tomé and Príncipe, an island also discovered by explorer Fernão do Pó, were also referred to as Fernandinos at one point.\\n\\nNative Fernandinos spoke Equatoguinean Spanish, French, Bube and a form of pidgin English called pichinglis. Pichinglis was brought to Fernando Po by Efik settlers of Akwa Akpa State (known during colonial times as Calabar State) in Nigeria. The dialect was used in trade activities, and may have varied slightly per region. The dialect was stigmatized during the Franco regime.\\n\\nThrough the strong religious influence under Spanish colonial rule, mulatto Fernandinos were mainly Roman Catholic, as were most Bubi living on Bioko during this era.\\n\\nThe other Fernandinos of Equatorial Guinea descended from English speaking freed slaves of Sierra Leone and Liberia. Essentially, Krios are descendants of liberated Africans, as well as repatriated West Indians and African-Americans who immigrated back to Africa, Liberia, in the 1800s. Supported by the American Colonization Society, groups of free African-Americans emigrated primarily from Nova Scotia and England to Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Bioko Island where they became a dominant force in the evolution of local society and economy, assisting America as well European empires in the colonial progression of these regions. They were initially discouraged from mingling with the local, less education and/or liberated indigenous people and more inclined to inter-marry with families of similar backgrounds. Krios eventually blended with the local populations, with Krio women and offspring taking on the surnames of indigenous families. They have contributed to the present-day existence of a very ethnically/racially mixed population that exists up and down the West Coast of Africa where the reality of such great heritage diversity, heavily influenced by the West, tends to be subdued.\\n\\nThe Krios arrived on the island of Fernando Po in 1827, a year after Great Britain leased the island of Fernando Po for fifty years. Thus the Krios joined an influx of several hundred freed Creole African descended immigrants from Cape Coast and other groups from British colonized Africa. The Krios began populating an area known as Clarence Cove - a harbor. The first inhabitants purchased dwellings for $3,000 to $5,000, with a handful of large plantation owners who'd engaged in cocoa and yam farming industry which was controlled by English and Spanish factory owners. Krios have been noted for their scholastic achievement and business acumen.\\n\\nThroughout the generations they have managed to maintain their own language, Fernando Poo Creole English. Krio Fernandinos are exclusively concentrated around Malabo. Although they comprise a distinct ethnic group in Equatorial Guinea, their pidgin dialect is spoken in only six communities (Musola, Las Palmas, Sampaca, Basupu, Fiston and Balveri de Cristo Rey). In 1998 it was estimated that the number of fluent Equatoguinean speakers of this language was at 5,000. For 1,000 of those 5,000 speakers this was their only language. Up to 70,000 EquatoGuineans may currently use it as a trade language. \\n\\nToday, Fernando Poo Creole English and Pichinglis have long been fused into one dialect.\\n\\nThe majority of Krio Fernandinos are Christian. Krios have contributed to the presence of the Protestant church in Bioko; however, many Krios are also Roman Catholic.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fernando Poe, Jr.", "body": "Ronald Allan Kelley Poe (August 20, 1939 – December 14, 2004), better known as Fernando Poe, Jr. and colloquially known as FPJ and Da King, was a Filipino actor and cultural icon. From the 1950s, Poe played steadfast film heroes who fight for the common man, which won him respect and admiration. He did not complete high school but went on to win numerous awards and prizes as an actor and film director.During the latter part of his career, he ran an unsuccessful bid for President of the Philippines in the 2004 presidential election against the former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\\n\\nHe was honored on May 24, 2006 as Philippine National Artist through Philippine Proclamation No. 1065.\\n\\nRonald Allan K. Poe was born on August 20, 1939 in Manila, Philippines, of Filipinos of Pangasinan people, Spanish, Kapampangan, and Irish American extraction, the son of actor-producer-director Fernando Poe, Sr. of San Carlos City, Pangasinan (1916–1951) and Bessie Gatbonton Kelley (1918–1999) of Candaba, Pampanga.  His mother, Bessie Kelley, was an American and sometimes called Elizabeth Kelley in some sources especially in Philippine press. His mother's parents, Arthur Kelley (WWI Army Corp of Engineer from Iowa, USA) was an Irish American who settled in the Philippines and Martha Gatbonton, a Filipina of mixed Kapampangan and Spanish heritage.Poe Jr.'s parents were not legally married yet when he was born in 1939. His parents later married in 1940. He was the second of six siblings, born after Elizabeth and before Fernando II (Andy), Genevieve (Jenny), Fredrick (Freddieboy), and Evangeline. His name at birth was Ronald Allan Kelley Poe; his brother Andy was the legal Fernando Poe Jr.\\n\\nActor Conrad Poe was his half-brother, the illegitimate son of Fernando Poe, Sr. by actress Patricia Mijares. The original family surname was spelled Pou from his grandfather, playwright Lorenzo Pou, a Catalan migrant from Majorca, Spain, who ventured into mining and business in the Philippines. As his father was a famous actor, Poe had small parts in several movies of the 1940s. However, Fernando Poe, Sr. died in 1951 after a rabid puppy licked his wounds.Poe finished primary education in 1953 at San Beda College. For high school, he went to San Sebastian College, Mapua Institute of Technology, and University of the East. After the death of his father, he dropped out of the University of the East in his sophomore year in order to work to support his family. He worked odd jobs, including as a cleaner, a messenger boy and a stuntman, before becoming a full-time actor. He then adopted the screen name Fernando Poe, Jr..\\n\\nPoe dropped out of high school to work in the Filipino film industry as a messenger boy, and was given acting roles in subsequent years. Starting as a stuntman for Everlasting Pictures, he was given a break and landed his first starring role in the movie Anak ni Palaris (Son of Palaris) at the age of 14. The movie was not a big hit. In 1957, the movie Lo Waist Gang made him popular, and the film was such a big hit that low-waist pants became a fad.\\n\\nKnown also as FPJ from his initials, Poe acted in a number of movies which depicted him as the champion of the poor and downtrodden. He also directed nine movies, under the pseudonym Ronwaldo Reyes. Reyes originated from the surname of his paternal grandmother, Martha. The name Ronwaldo Reyes also alliterates to Ronald Reagan, who like Poe, was an actor who later ran for President.\\n\\nHe established FPJ productions in 1961 and later organized other film companies such as D'Lanor, JAFERE, and Rosas Productions. In 1963, he testified against criminal gangs, known as the Big Four, who extorted money from the film industry. In 1965, he shared the lead in The Ravagers, a film depicting the United States and the Philippines working together against Japanese war time occupation. The film is considered one of the most influential Filipino films.\\n\\nPoe became an award-winning actor and garnered the most best actor awards at the FAMAS. Among the movies that received awards were Mga Alabok ng Lupa (1967), Asedillo (1971), Durugin si Totoy Bato, Umpisahan Mo, Tatapusin Ko (1983), and Muslim Magnum .357 (1987).\\n\\nAmong his famous movies include playing Flavio in the mythical Ang Panday series, Kahit Konting Pagtingin, Dito sa Pitong Gatang and Aguila. His last movie was Pakners which also stars 9-ball billiards champion Efren \"Bata\" Reyes.\\n\\nFernando Poe Jr., was the Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP)'s candidate for the 2004 presidential election. A public figure in his movie career and known for his charitable but unpublicized endeavours, he targeted his candidacy at the same poor whom he championed in his movies.\\n\\nPoe accepted the nomination in December 2003 and was to be the standard opposition bearer for the Philippines' 2004 presidential election. Some accounts portray him as a reluctant candidate who was only prevailed upon to accept the nomination by his best friend, former President Joseph Estrada. But other accounts say he was convinced to cast his bid for the presidency because of the overwhelming crowd that gathered for the first rally of the FPJ for President Movement at the Cuneta Astrodome in Pasay City.\\n\\nHe is the best friend of the former President and actor Erap Estrada. Poe married actress Susan Roces(real name Jesusa Sonora) in December 1968 in a civil wedding. They were later married in a church and among their primary sponsors were then President Ferdinand Marcos and First Lady Imelda Marcos. They adopted their only daughter, current MTRCB Chairman Mary Grace Poe-Llamanzares.\\n\\nAlthough a famous public figure, Poe had been very reclusive about his personal life. However, in February, 2004, during the presidential campaign, Poe admitted to having sired a child out of wedlock. That children are Ronian (Ron Allan) with former actress Anna Marin\\n\\nthumbPoe was admitted to Saint Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City on the evening of December 11, 2004 after complaining of dizziness at a gathering in his production studio premise. He suffered from a stroke and slipped into a coma while being treated for a brain clot. Doctors described his condition as a cerebral thrombosis with multiple organ failure. He died at the age of 65 on December 14 at 12:01 am, without regaining consciousness. Friends and allies from the movie and political worlds were at his bedside. He left behind his wife actress Susan Roces and daughter, Mary Grace\\n\\nThe nine day wake was attended by hundreds of thousands, with organizers claiming numbers as high as two million. The funeral procession drew tens of thousands who crowded the streets of Quezon City, an event that was reminiscent of the funeral processions of Ninoy Aquino in 1983 and matinee idol Julie Vega in 1985. He was buried in his family plot along with his father and mother in North Cemetery, Manila, Philippines.\\n\\nthumbOn December 14, 2010, Susan Roces led 6th death anniversary rites by a Mass visit to the cemetery in simple rites for husband Fernando Poe Jr. \"Dear uncle Ronnie, I love you, I miss you\" small Christmas cards were placed near flowers on Poe's tomb.\\n\\nFernando\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fernie, British Columbia", "body": "Fernie is a city in the Elk Valley area of the East Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia, Canada, located on BC Highway 3 on the eastern approaches to the Crowsnest Pass through the Rocky Mountains. Founded in 1898 and incorporated as the City of Fernie in July 1904, the municipality has a year-round population of 4,217  with an additional 1,873 outside city limits in communities under the jurisdiction of the Regional District of East Kootenay. A substantial seasonal population swells the city during the winter months.\\n\\nFernie lies on the Elk River, along Canada's southernmost east-west transportation corridor through the Rockies that crosses the range via the Crowsnest Pass, 40 kilometres (25 mi) to the east. As the largest and longest-established community between Cranbrook and Lethbridge, Fernie serves as a minor regional centre, particularly for its fellow Elk Valley communities.\\n\\nFernie is the only city-class municipality in Canada that is fully encircled by the Rocky Mountains. The townsite was laid out in the crook of a doglegged glacial valley that today is drained by the Elk River. Three tributaries of the Elk—Coal, Lizard, and Fairy Creeks—rise in its side valley and join the Elk either within or in close proximity to the townsite.\\n\\nTo the north of the city lie Mount Fernie, Mount Klauer, The Three Sisters and Mount Proctor. To the northeast is Mount Hosmer, to the east is Fernie Ridge, to the southeast is Morrissey Ridge (and its notable outcropping, Castle Mountain) and to the southwest are the various peaks of the Lizard Range. Fernie gives the name to the Jurassic-Age Fernie Formation. The Lizard Range is home to Fernie Alpine Resort, one of the largest ski resort in Canada, and Island Lake Lodge, a resort.\\n\\nAverage Fernie Alpine Resort Annual Snowfall: \\t8.75 m/29 ft\\n\\nthumbWhile the slopes of the mountains are the present focus of economic activity, until comparatively recently residents of the area were more interested in the mountains' innards. The vast Crowsnest Coal Field lies just to the east of the city, and Fernie owes its origins to nineteenth-century prospector William Fernie, who established the coal industry that continues to exist to this day. Acting on pioneer Michael Phillips' twin discoveries of coal and the Crowsnest Pass a few years earlier, Fernie founded the Crows Nest Pass Coal Company in 1897 and established a temporary encampment near Coal Creek. The Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in the valley the following year, and a townsite emerged parallel to the railway line slightly north of the initial encampment, or \"Old Town.\" Underground coal mines were dug 10 kilometres (6 mi) away from the townsite in the narrow Coal Creek valley and until 1960 a small satellite community known as Coal Creek stood adjacent to them. A variety of other mines were sunk into the coal fields in a fifty-kilometer radius in the following two decades. No mining was ever carried out in Fernie proper; coking of Coal Creek coal was carried out at the townsite, but otherwise the town developed into an administrative and commercial centre for the burgeoning industry. Forestry played a smaller role in the local economy and a local brewery produced Fernie Beer from Brewery Creek (mountain spring water).\\n\\nLike most single-industry towns, Fernie endured several boom-and-bust cycles throughout the twentieth century, generally tied to the global price of coal. The mines at Coal Creek closed permanently by 1960 and the focus of mining activity shifted to Michel and Natal about twenty-five kilometres (15 mi) upriver, which sat on a more productive portion of the Crowsnest Coal Field. Kaiser Resources opened immense open-pit mines there in the 1970s to meet new thermal coal contracts for the Asian industrial market, predominantly for use in blast furnace. Fernie would remain an important residential base for mine labour, along with the new communities of Sparwood and Elkford that sprang up much closer to these new mines. Today, Teck Resources operates all five open-pit mines, shipping out unit trains (often with more than 100 cars) along the Canadian Pacific Railway through Fernie to the Pacific Coast, where the coal is loaded onto freighters at Roberts Bank Superport in Delta.\\n\\nAfter a disastrous fire leveled much of the downtown core in 1904, the fledgling municipal government passed an ordinance requiring all buildings in the area to be built of 'fireproof' materials like brick and stone. Consequently, a new city centre rose from the ashes sporting brick buildings along broad avenues that would have looked more at home in a sedate and refined Victorian city than a rough-and-tumble frontier coal town. They were short-lived, however, as a second, larger inferno swept through the city on August 1, 1908. Whipped up by sudden winds, a nearby forest fire burnt its way into a lumber yard on the edge of the community and sparked a Dresden-style firestorm that melted brick and mortar and essentially erased the entire city in an afternoon. There were few casualties, however, and for a second time a stately brick downtown core rose from the ashes. Today, these historic buildings, most of which still stand, are a treasured and distinctive feature of the community.\\n\\nDowntown Fernie was used for the downtown of the fictional Kodiak Valley ski resort in the 2010 Hollywood film Hot Tub Time Machine.\\n\\nSummer in Fernie is generally far quieter than the winter months, though mountain biking, fly fishing and golf are increasingly important tourist draws.\\n\\nFernie is also home to The Fernie Seconday School Robotics Club, which traveled to Atlanta Georgia for the world championships, the farthest distance travelled by a Fernie School team.\\n\\nThe following people were born in Fernie\\n\\n"}

Besides the payment of an annual rent of 200,000 ''reais'', Gomes was to explore 100 league of the coast of Africa per year, for five years (later the agreement would be extended for another year). He got also the trading exclusive for a popular substitute of black pepper then called \"malagueta\", the guinea pepper (''Aframomum melegueta'') against another yearly payment of 100,000 reais.\\n\\nThus, Gomes promoted the exploration in the Atlantic African coast. Employing explorers such as João de Santarém, Pedro Escobar, Lopo Gonçalves, Fernão do Pó and Pedro de Sintra, he did it even beyond hired: with his sponsorship the Portuguese reached the Cape of Santa Catarina, already in the Southern Hemisphere, and also the islands of the Gulf of Guinea.\\n\\nIn 1471 they reached Elmina (meaning \"the Mine\"), where they found a thriving alluvial gold trade. With the substantial revenues he got, especially the trade of his warehouse in Mina, he become known as \"Fernão Gomes da Mina\" in 1474. With his profits from African trade, Fernão Gomes assisted the Portuguese king in the conquests of Asilah, Alcacer Ceguer and Tangier in Morocco, were he was knighted. Later, in 1478, gathering honors and with an enormous influence on the economy of the kingdom, he was appointed to the royal council.\\n\\nGiven the large profits, in 1482 new king John II of Portugal ordered a factory to be built in Elmina, to manage the local gold industry: Elmina Castle.\\n\\nHe married Catarina Leme, one of the natural children of wealthy merchant Martim Leme (Lisbon - Brussels, 27 March 1487, youngest of three sons of Flemish Martim Lems, born and died in Bruges and married in Lisbon to Joana Barroso, who also died in Bruges), Nobleman of the Royal Household, by Leonor Rodrigues, and had Catarina Leme, wife of João Rodrigues Pais, and Nuno Fernandes da Mina, married to Isabel Queimado and Violante de Brito.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Ferranti Orion", "body": "The Orion was a mid-range mainframe computer introduced by Ferranti in 1959 and installed for the first time in 1961. Ferranti positioned Orion to be their primary offering during the early 1960s, complementing their high-end Atlas and smaller systems like the Sirius and Argus. The Orion was based on a new type of logic circuit known as \"Neuron\" and included built-in multitasking support, one of the earliest commercial machines to do so.\\n\\nPerformance of the system was much less than expected and the Orion was a business disaster, selling only about eleven machines. The Orion 2 project was quickly started to address its problems, and five of these were sold. The failure of the Orion was the capstone to a long series of losses for the Manchester labs, and with the failure of the Orion management grew tired of the entire market. The division was sold to International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), who selected the Canadian Ferranti-Packard 6000 as their mid-range offering, ending further sales of the Orion 2.\\n\\nDuring the 1950s transistor were expensive and relatively fragile devices. Although they had advantages for computer designers, namely lower power requirements and their smaller physical packaging, vacuum tube remained the primary logic device until the early 1960s. Through this period there were widespread efforts to use magnetic amplifier as an alternative solid state device.\\n\\nSimilar to magnetic core memory, or \"cores\", magnetic amplifiers used small toroids of ferrite as a switching element. When current passed through the core a magnetic field would be induced that would reach a maximum value based on the saturation point of the material being used. The field induced current in a separate read circuit, creating an amplified output. Unlike digital logic based on tubes or transistors, which uses defined voltages to represent values, magnetic amplifiers based their logic values on current flows. This was known as \"Ballot Box Logic\" due to the way the inputs \"voted\" on the output.\\n\\nOne advantage to magnetic amplifiers is that they are open in the center and several input lines can be threaded through them. This makes it easy to implement chains of \"OR\" logic by threading a single core with all the inputs that need to be ORed together. This was widely used in the \"best two out of three\" circuits that were widely used in binary adders, which could reduce the component count of the ALU considerably. Another way to use this feature was to use the same cores for different duties during different periods of the machine cycle, say to load memory during one portion and then as part of an adder in another. Each of the cores could be used for as many duties as there was room for wiring through the center.\\n\\nIn the late 1950s new techniques were introduced in transistor manufacture that led to a rapid fall in prices while reliability shot up. By the early 1960s most magnetic amplifier efforts were abandoned. Few machines using the circuits reached the market, the best known examples being the mostly-magnetic UNIVAC Solid State (1959) and the mostly transistorized English Electric KDF9 (1963).\\n\\nThe Ferranti Computer Department in West Gorton Manchester had originally been set up as an industrial partner of Manchester University's pioneering computer research lab, commercializing their Manchester Mark 1 and several follow-on designs. During the 1950s, under the direction of Brian Pollard, the Gorton labs also researched magnetic amplifiers. Like most teams, they decided to abandon them when transistors improved.\\n\\nOne member of the lab, Ken Johnson, proposed a new type of transistor-based logic that followed the same conventions as the magnetic amplifiers, namely that binary logic was based on known currents instead of voltages. Like the magnetic amplifiers, Johnson's \"Neuron\" design could be used to control several different inputs. Better yet, the system often required only one transistor per logic element, whereas conventional voltage-based logic would require two or more. Although transistors were falling in price they were still expensive, so a Neuron based machine might offer similar performance at a much lower price than a machine based on traditional transistor logic.\\n\\nThe team decided to test the Neuron design by building a small machine known as \"Newt\", short for \"Neuron test\". This machine was so successful that the lab decided to expand the testbed into a complete computer. The result was the Sirius, which was announced on 19 May 1959 with claims that it was the smallest and most economically priced computer in the European market. Several sales followed.\\n\\nWith the success of Sirius, the team turned its attention to a much larger design. Since many of the costs of a complete computer system are fixed - power supplies, printers, etc. - a more complex computer with more internal circuitry would have more of its cost associated with the circuits themselves. For this reason, a larger machine made of Neurons would have an increased price advantage over transistorized offerings. Pollard decided that such a machine would be a strong counterpart to the high-end Atlas, and would form the basis for Ferranti's sales for the next five years.\\n\\nLooking for a launch customer, Ferranti signed up Prudential Assurance with the promise to deliver the machine in 1960. However, these plans quickly went awry. The Neuron proved unable to be adapted to the larger physical size of the Orion. Keeping the current levels steady over the longer wire runs was extremely difficult, and efforts to cure the problems resulted in lengthy delays. The first Orion was eventually delivered, but was over a year late and unit cost was more than expected, limiting its sales. Between 1962 and 1964 the Computing Division lost $7.5 million, largely as a result of the Orion.\\n\\nDuring the Orion's gestation it appeared there was a real possibility the new system might not work at all. Engineers at other Ferranti departments, notably the former Lily Hill House in Bracknell, started raising increasingly vocal concerns about the effort. Several members from Bracknell approached Gordon Scarrott and tried to convince him that Orion should be developed using an all-transistor design. They recommended using the \"Griblons\" circuits developed by Maurice Gribble at Ferranti's Wythenshawe plant, which they had used to successfully implement their Argus computer for the Bristol Bloodhound missile system. Their efforts failed, they turned to Pollard to overrule Scarrott, which led to a series of increasingly acrimonious exchanges. After their last attempt on 5 November 1958, they decided to go directly to Sebastian de Ferranti, but this effort also failed.\\n\\nPollard resigned about a month later and his position was taken over by Peter Hall. Braunholtz later expressed his frustration that they didn't write to him directly, and the matter sat for several years while Orion continued to run into delays. In September 1961 Prudential was threatening to cancel their order, and by chance, Braunholtz at that moment sent a telegram to Hall expressing his continuing concerns. Hall immediately invited Braunholtz to talk about his ideas, and several days later the Bracknell team was working full out on what would become the Orion 2.\\n\\nBy the end of October the basic design was complete, and the team started looking for a transistor logic design to use for implementation. Although Braunholtz had suggested using the Griblons, the Bracknell group also invited a team of engineers from Ferranti Canada to discuss their recent successes with their \"Gemini\" design, which was used in their ReserVec system. On November 2 the Bracknell team decided to adopt the Gemini circuitry for Orion 2.\\n\\nParts arrived from many Ferranti divisions over the next year, and the machine was officially switched on by Peter Hunt on 7 January 1963. The first Orion 2 was delivered to Prudential on 1 December 1964, running at about five times the speed of the Orion 1. Prudential bought a second machine for the processing of industrial branch policies. Another system was sold to the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society in Cape Town where it was used for updating insurance policies. A fourth was sold to Beecham Group to upgrade its Orion 1 system. The original prototype was kept by ICT and used for software development by the Nebula Compiler team.\\n\\nBy this point, however, Ferranti was already well on the road to selling all of its business computing divisions to ICT. As part of their due diligence process, ICT studied both the Orion 2 and the FP-6000. Ferranti's own engineers concluded that \"There are certain facets of the system we do not like. However, were we to begin designing now a machine in the same price/performance range as the FP6000, we would have in some 18 months' time a system that would not be significantly better -if indeed any better- than the FP6000.\" ICT chose to move forward with the FP-6000 with minor modifications, and used it as the basis for their ICT 1900 line through the 1960s. Existing contracts for the Orion 2 were filled, and sales ended.\\n\\nAlthough the Orion and Orion 2 differed significantly in their internals, their programming interface and external peripherals were almost identical.\\n\\nThe basic Orion machine included 4,096 48-bit words of slow, 12µs, core memory, which could be expanded to 16,384 words. Each word could be organized as eight 6-bit characters, a single 48-bit binary number, or a single floating-point number with 40-bits of \"fraction\" and an 8-bit exponent. The system included built-in capabilities for working with Pound sterling before decimalization. The core memory was backed by one or two magnetic drum with 16k words each. Various offline input/output included magnetic disk, tape drive, punched card, punched tape and printers.\\n\\nMost of the Orion's instruction set used a three-address form, with sixty-four 48-bit accumulators. Each program had its own private accumulator set which were the first 64 registers of its address space, which was a reserved contiguous subset of the physical store, defined by the contents of a \"datum\" relocation register. Operand addresses were relative to the datum, and could be modified by one of the accumulators for indexing arrays and similar tasks. A basic three-address instruction took a minimum of 64 µs, a two-address one 48 µs, and any index modifications on the addresses added 16 µs per modified address. Multiplication took from 156 to 172 µs, and division anywhere from 564 to 1,112 µs, although the average time was 574 µs. The Orion 2, having a core store with a much shorter cycle time, was considerably faster.\\n\\nA key feature of the Orion system was its built-in support for time-sharing. This was supported by a series of input/output (I/O) interrupts, or what they referred to as \"lockouts\". The system automatically switched programs during the time spent waiting for the end of an I/O operation. The Orion also supported protected memory in the form of pre-arranged \"reservations\". Starting and stopping programs, as well as selecting new ones to run when one completed, was the duty of the \"Organisation Program.\" The Orion was one of the earliest machines to directly support time-sharing in hardware in spite of intense industry interest; other time-sharing systems of the same era include PLATO in early 1961, CTSS later that year, and the English Electric KDF9 and FP-6000 of 1964.\\n\\nThe Orion is also notable for the use of its own high-level business language, NEBULA. Nebula was created because of Ferranti's perception that the COBOL standard of 1960 was not sufficiently powerful for their machines, notably as COBOL was developed in the context of decimal, character-oriented batch processing, while Orion was a binary word-oriented multiprogramming system. NEBULA adapted many of COBOL's basic concepts, adding new ones of their own. NEBULA was later ported to the Atlas as well.\\n\\n"}

They used a mid-mounted flat-12 (180° V12, not actually with a Boxer crankshaft) engine, replacing the FR layout Daytona, and were succeeded in the Ferrari stable by the Testarossa.\\n\\nProduction of the BB was a major step for Enzo Ferrari. He felt that a mid-engined road car would be too difficult for his buyers to handle, and it took many years for his engineers to convince him to adopt the layout. This attitude began to change as the marque lost its racing dominance in the late 1950s to mid-engined competitors. The mid-engined 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder Dino racing cars were the result, and Ferrari later allowed for the production Dino road cars to use the layout as well. The company also moved its V12 engines to the rear with its P and LM racing cars, but the Daytona was launched with its engine in front. It was not until 1971 that a mid-engined 12-cylinder road car would appear.\\n\\nNo BB was ever originally sold in North America, as Enzo did not believe it to be worth the cost of federalizing. However, third parties made conversions, and quite a few of them are now in the United States. \\n\\nThe first \"Boxer\" was the 365 GT4 BB shown at the 1971 Turin Motor Show. Designed to rival the Lamborghini Miura, it was finally released for sale in 1973 at the Paris Motor Show. 387 were built, with 88 in right-hand drive (of which 58 for the UK market), making it the rarest of all Berlinetta Boxers. The Pininfarina-designed body was an angular wedge with popup headlight.\\n\\nThough it shared its numerical designation with the Daytona, the Boxer was radically different. It was a mid-engined car like the Dino, and the now flat-12 engine was mounted longitudinal rather than transversely.\\n\\nThe engine shared its internal dimensions with the V12 from the Daytona, but was spread out to 180° as on Ferrari's 1970 Formula One car and was mounted above a five-speed manual transmission. One major difference in this engine was its use of timing belt rather than chains.\\n\\nThe 365 was updated as the BB 512 in 1976, resurrecting the name of the earlier Ferrari 512 racer. The engine was larger at 4942 cc, had an increased compression ratio of 9.2:1, and a new dual plate clutch to handle the added power and ease pedal effort. Dry sump lubrication was used to prevent oil starvation in hard cornering due to revised rear suspension and wider rear tires. External differentiators included a new front spoiler, wider rear tires, added NACA side air vents ducting air to the brakes, and four tail lights (instead of six).\\n\\n929 BB 512 models were produced.\\n\\nThe Bosch K-Jetronic CIS fuel injected BB 512i introduced in 1981 was the last of the series. The fuel injected motor produced cleaner emissions and offered a better balance of performance and daily-driver temperament.\\n\\nExternal differentiators from the BB 512 besides badging include a change to metric sized wheels and the Michelin TRX metric tire system, small white running lights in the nose, and red rear fog lamps outboard of the exhaust pipes in the rear valance. \\n\\n1,007 BB 512i models were produced.\\n\\nMeasurements are notoriously variable, inaccurate, and definitionally vague even from Ferrari-issued sources of the same period. For example, the workshop manual documents maximum speed (typically speed at redline) whereas the owner's manual documents \"attainable\" speed which appears to be speed at maximum HP per RPM not exceeding redline; for the 512 and 512i, this is likely not the maximum speed. Also, the workshop manual does not consistently distinguish measurements between the carbureted (512) and injected (512i) engines except with respect to the fuel delivery system, even though it is common knowledge that differences exist.\\n\\nBerlinetta Boxer\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Festival of Flanders", "body": "Festival of Flanders (Dutch: Festival van Vlaanderen) is an annual music event at different locations in Flanders. It started initially as a \"Summer Festival\", but now its activities are spread from January to May, with a peak in the late summer and early autumn.\\n\\nThe Festival of Flanders has its roots in Tongeren, Limburg, where Jan Briers organized the Basilica-concerts from 1958 in the basilica of Tongeren. At first there was played religiously inspired choral music, but soon it was extended to other classical music, instrumental music; and other locations. Often, historical sites such as abbey and castles are used, with an occasional transfer to Maastricht.\\n\\nAs in other Flemish cities (classical) summer concerts were held as well, they joined forces in 1972 and created the more comprehensive 'Festival of Flanders'.\\n\\nThe organization was actively supported by the newly emancipated Flemish \"cultural autonomy\". Especially in Brussels they wanted to exhibit \"serious\" Flemish culture. Partly because because of this, they could bring prestigious orchestra and big names to Flanders. At the same time it gave the festival a somewhat elitist character.\\n\\nIn the nineties, they began to see the creation of this one-sided image and so the program was expanded to include contemporary music, sound art, youth, jazz, organ music, musical theater, and cross-overs with visual arts, film, dance.\\n\\nThe Festival of Flanders exists of diverse festivals spread across different Flemish cities and provinces:\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Festung Warschau", "body": "thumbFestung Warschau (German for Fortress Warsaw) was the name applied in German language to Warsaw when the city was defended, which happened under various constellations in the course of history, with and without involvement of German-speaking troops. \\n\\nIn the 20th century, the term Festung Warschau was used three times, all due to German participation. It was used when the Germans threw back the Russian advance in 1914, and by October, the city of Warsaw came within distance of the fighting. The term resurfaced during World War II, beginning with September 1939's German invasion of Poland. Later in the war, three years after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, Festung Warschau again entered German vocabularly, as between September 1944 and January 1945, the retreating Germans tried to establish a defense in the city.\\n\\nDuring the Invasion of Poland in 1939 the German troops reached the outskirts of Warsaw on September 9. The Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) assumed that the unfortified city damaged by countless terror bombing raids would be taken by German motorized units without any resistance and issued a press and radio release stating that the capital of Poland was taken. However, the German motorized assault was defeated and the advancing troops were forced to retreat with heavy casualties. From September 8 the city started to be referred to as Fortress of Warsaw in German broadcasts, which was to justify the aerial bombardment of civilian targets.\\n\\nThe forces of the defenders, composed initially of only several battalion and various units of second-line troops, were soon strengthened by the soldiers of the Armies Poznań and Pomorze that reached the city in the aftermath of the Battle of Bzura. The Germans laid a siege to the city and started shelling it with heavy artillery located in the outskirts. However, the defending troops managed to defeat all assaults and until the end of September the Germans could not manage to break into the city. \\n\\nAfter three weeks of constant aerial and artillery bombardment and assaults, the situation of the civilian inhabitants of Warsaw became dire. Food, water and medicine shortages as well as the Luftwaffe strafing inhabitants and refugee grouped within the city caused Warsaw's civilian authorities to request a cease-fire. Warsaw President Stefan Starzyński and Gen. Walerian Czuma, commander of the Warsaw garrison, decided that further resistance, although possible, would only expose the civilians to unnecessary hardship and signed the capitulation on September 28, 1939. The German text of the capitulation treaty as well as German propaganda used the term Festung Warschau to suggest that the failures of the Wehrmacht were due to heavily fortified terrain they had to cross.Warsaw, as a former Russian fortress, had several older fortifications, e.g. a ring of forts round the city and a citadel, built between 1835 and 1905. But those fortifications failed to prevent the city from being overrun in World War I, as Warsaw was occupied by German and Austro-Hungarian troops in 1915.\\n\\nBy 1944 the German Eastern Front's situation became hopeless. Adolf Hitler who took over personally many duties in the OKW and OKH ordered the no step back policy in an attempt to halt the Soviet offensives which could not be contained by open field battle anymore. Following this policy, several cities were declared Festungen (Fortresses) and were to be held by the German army at all cost, even if surrounded and with no hope to break the siege. Examples of this policy were the Festung Stalingrad and Festung Kiev. \\n\\nLater in the war, the \"Festung\" concept that was to be illustrated by the propaganda film Kolberg which reminds of that city's defense against Napoleon in 1807, was also applied to German cities like Königsberg, Breslau, Frankfurt (Oder) and Berlin. Often even the civil population was supposed to support the rather suicidal attempts of defense, as the cities were largely destroyed in the course of the fights.\\n\\nOn July 27, 1944 Adolf Hitler ordered the Festung Warschau to be created and defended at all cost. The same day the governor of the General Government, Hans Frank, called for 100,000 Polish men between the ages of 17–65 to arrive at several gathering places in Warsaw the following day. They were to be employed at construction of fortifications for the Wehrmacht in and around the city. This move was viewed by the Armia Krajowa as an attempt to neutralize the underground forces, and the underground urged Warsaw inhabitants to ignore it. Fearing that the city would be turned into ruins and share the fate of Stalingrad and Kiev, General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski ordered Operation Tempest to be started in Warsaw, which resulted in the Warsaw Uprising that lasted from August through September.\\n\\nAfter the Uprising, during which the Soviets troops had arrived near the Vistula, the Germans razed the city to the ground and continued the construction of concrete bunkers that were to defend Festung Warschau against the Red Army for four months. However, when the Soviets finally crossed the Vistula on January 17, 1945, the city was captured in several hours with little resistance from the remaining German garrison. The Chief of the Operational Branch of the German Army General Staff (Generalstab des Heeres), Colonel Bogislaw von Bonin gave permission to the retreat of German Heeresgruppe A from Warsaw on January 16, 1945 throughout the Soviet Vistula-Oder Offensive and was imprisoned on January 19, 1945 by the Gestapo at Flossenbürg concentration camp and Dachau concentration camp as he rejected a direct command of Adolf Hitler by this action.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder", "body": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) describes a continuum of permanent birth defect caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, which includes, but is not limited to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Approximately 1 percent of children are believed to suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.\\n\\nOver time, as it became apparent through research and clinical experience that a range of effects (including physical, behavioral, and cognitive) could arise from prenatal alcohol exposure, the term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, or FASD, was developed to include Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) as well as other conditions resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. There are a number of other subtypes with evolving nomenclature and definitions based on partial expressions of FAS, including Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (PFAS), Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND), Alcohol-Related Birth Defects (ARBD), and Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE).\\n\\nThe term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders is not in itself a clinical diagnosis but describes the full range of disabilities that may result from prenatal alcohol exposure. Currently, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the only expression of prenatal alcohol exposure that is defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and assigned ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnoses.\\n\\nThe original syndrome of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was reported in 1973, four FASD diagnostic systems that diagnose FAS and other FASD conditions have been developed in North America:\\n\\nEach diagnostic system requires that a complete FASD evaluation include assessment of the four key features of FASD, described below. A positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of FAS, the first diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. However, prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of FASD, and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an FASD diagnosis that is not \"full-blown FAS.\" Diagnoses are described in a following section.\\n\\nApproximately 1 percent of children are affected by fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; the majority of these children fail to receive a proper diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. One study found that 6 out of 7 first grade age children failed to receive a diagnosis and another study found that of 40 new born babies with obvious fetal alcohol syndrome 100 percent left the hospital without a diagnosis.\\n\\nEach of the key features of FASD can vary widely within one individual exposed to prenatal alcohol. While consensus exists for the definition and diagnosis of FAS across diagnostic systems, minor variations among the systems lead to differences in definitions and diagnostic cut-off criteria for other disgnoses across the FASD continuum. (The central nervous system (CNS) damage criteria particularly lack clear consensus.) A working knowledge of the key features is helpful in understanding FASD diagnoses and conditions, and each are reviewed with attention to similarities and differences across the four diagnostic systems.\\n\\nIn terms of FASD, growth deficiency is defined as significantly below average height, weight or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure, and can be assessed at any point in the lifespan. Growth measurements must be adjusted for parental height, gestational age (for a premature infant), and other postnatal insults (e.g., poor nutrition), although birth height and weight are the preferred measurements. Deficiencies are documented when height or weight falls at or below the 10th percentile of standardized growth charts appropriate to the patient's population.\\n\\nCriteria for FASD are least specific in the IOM diagnostic system (\"low birth weight..., decelerating weight not due to nutrition..., [or] disproportional low weight to height\" p. 4 of executive summary), while the CDC and Canadian guidelines use the 10th percentile as a cut-off to determine growth deficiency. The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" allows for mid-range gradations in growth deficiency (between the 3rd and 10th percentiles) and severe growth deficiency at or below the 3rd percentile. Growth deficiency (at severe, moderate, or mild levels) contributes to diagnoses of FAS and PFAS, but not ARND or static encephalopathy.\\n\\nGrowth deficiency is ranked as follows by the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code:\"\\n\\nIn the initial studies that discovered FAS, growth deficiency was a requirement for inclusion in the studies; thus, all the original patients with FAS had growth deficiency as an artifact of sampling characteristics used to establish criteria for the syndrome. That is, growth deficiency is a key feature of FASD because growth deficiency was a criterion for inclusion in the original study that determined the definition of FAS. This reinforces assertions that growth deficiency and FAS facial features are less critical for understanding the disability of FASD than the neurobehavioral sequelae to the brain damage.\\n\\nSeveral characteristic craniofacial abnormalities are visible in individuals with FAS, but these may be mild or even non-existent in other FASD conditions. \\n\\nRefinements in diagnostic criteria since 1975 have yielded three distinctive and diagnostically significant facial features known to result from prenatal alcohol exposure and distinguishes FAS from other disorders with partially overlapping characteristics. The three FAS facial features are:\\n\\nMeasurement of FAS facial features uses criteria developed by the University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide, a 5-point Likert Scale with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal (ranked 1) to severe (ranked 5). Palpebral fissure length (PFL) is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a PFL growth chart, also developed by the University of Washington.\\n\\nAll four diagnostic systems have agreed upon this method for determining FAS facial feature severity rankings. Ranking FAS facial features is complicated because the three separate facial features can be affected independently by prenatal alcohol.\\n\\nCentral nervous system (CNS) damage is the primary key feature of any FASD diagnosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure, a teratogen, can damage the brain across a continuum of gross to subtle impairments, depending on the amount, timing, and frequency of the exposure as well as genetic predispositions of the fetus and mother. While functional abnormalities are the behavioral and cognitive expressions of the FASD disability, CNS damage can be assessed in three areas: structural, neurological, and functional impairments.\\n\\nAll four diagnostic systems allow for assessment of CNS damage in these areas, but criteria vary. The IOM system requires structural or neurological impairment for a diagnosis of FAS, but also allows a \"complex pattern\" of functional anomalies for diagnosing PFAS and ARND. The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" and CDC guidelines allow for a positive CNS finding in any of the three areas for any FASD diagnosis, but functional anomalies must measure at two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains for a diagnoses of FAS, PFAS, and ARND. The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" also allows for an FASD diagnosis when only two functional domains are measured at two standard deviations or worse. The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" further elaborates the degree of CNS damage according to four ranks:\\n\\nStructural abnormalities of the brain are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include microcephaly (small head size) of two or more standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia).\\n\\nMicrocephaly is determined by comparing head circumference (often called occipitofrontal circumference, or OFC) to appropriate OFC growth charts. Other structural impairments must be observed through medical imaging techniques by a trained physician. Because imaging procedures are expensive and relatively inaccessible to most patients, diagnosis of FASD is not frequently made via structural impairments except for microcephaly.\\n\\nWhen structural impairments are not observable or do not exist, neurological impairments are assessed. In the context of FASD, neurological impairments are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system, or the autonomic nervous system. A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a postnatal insult, such as a high fever, concussion, traumatic brain injury, etc.\\n\\nAll four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for CNS damage at the neurological level, and evidence of a CNS neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS or PFAS, and functional impairments are highly likely.\\n\\nNeurological problems are expressed as either hard signs, or diagnosable disorders, such as epilepsy or other seizure disorder, or soft signs. Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired fine motor skills, neurosensory hearing loss, poor gait, clumsiness, poor eye–hand coordination, or sensory integration dysfunction. Many soft signs have norm-referenced criteria, while others are determined through clinical judgment.\\n\\nWhen structural or neurological impairments are not observed, all four diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments. Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, often referred to as developmental disabilities. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such, so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems.\\n\\nThe four diagnostic systems list various CNS domains that can qualify for functional impairment that can determine an FASD diagnosis:\\n\\nA recent effort to standardize assessment of functional CNS damage has been suggested by an experienced FASD diagnostic team in Minnesota. The proposed framework attempts to harmonize IOM, 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, CDC, and Canadian guidelines for measuring CNS damage viz-a-viz FASD evaluations and diagnosis. The standardized approach is referred to as the Ten Brain Domains and encompasses aspects of all four diagnostic systems' recommendations for assessing CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure. The framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction, specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis, and defines intervention considerations that address the complex nature of FASD with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities.\\n\\nThe proposed Ten Brain Domains include:\\n\\nThe Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses unpublished Minnesota state criteria of performance at 1.5 or more standard deviation on standardized testing in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage. However, the Ten Brain Domains are easily incorporated into any of the four diagnostic systems' CNS damage criteria, as the framework only proposes the domains, rather than the cut-off criteria for FASD.\\n\\nPrenatal alcohol exposure is determined by interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mother's alcohol use during the pregnancy (if available), prenatal health records (if available), and review of available birth records, court records (if applicable), chemical dependency treatment records (if applicable), or other reliable sources.\\n\\nExposure level is assessed as Confirmed Exposure, Unknown Exposure, and Confirmed Absence of Exposure by the IOM, CDC and Canadian diagnostic systems. The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" further distinguishes confirmed exposure as High Risk and Some Risk:\\n\\nAmount, frequency, and timing of prenatal alcohol use can dramatically impact the other three key features of FASD. While consensus exists that alcohol is a teratogen, there is no clear consensus as to what level of exposure is toxic. The CDC guidelines are silent on these elements diagnostically. The IOM and Canadian guidelines explore this further, acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining, but offer no standard for diagnosis. Canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that \"heavy alcohol use\" is defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30 day period.\\n\\n\"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as High Risk and Some Risk. It operationalizes high risk exposure as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) greater than 100 mg/dL delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. This BAC level is typically reached by a 55 kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting.\\n\\nFor many adopted or adult patients and children in foster care, records or other reliable sources may not be available for review. Reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers, especially if alcohol use is ongoing. In these cases, all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation. A diagnosis of FAS is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of FASD are present at clinical levels.\\n\\nConfirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy. This designation is relatively rare, as most patients presenting for an FASD evaluation are at least suspected to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of FASD.\\n\\nWhile the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), there are still differences when full criteria for FAS are not met. This has resulted in differing and evolving nomenclature for other conditions across the spectrum of FASD, which may account for such a wide variety of terminology. Most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of FAS and fall into other FASD conditions. The Canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" for each key feature of FASD and the terminology of the IOM in diagnostic categories, excepting ARBD.\\n\\nFetal Alcohol Syndrome or FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a multi-disciplinary evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment. Generally, a trained physician will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through psychological, speech-language, and occupational therapy assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains. Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, psychologist, social work, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual.\\n\\nOther FASD conditions are partial expressions of FAS, and here the terminology shows less consensus across diagnostic systems, which has led to some confusion for clinicians and patients. A key point to remember is that other FASD conditions may create disabilities similar to FAS if the key area of central nervous system damage shows clinical deficits in two or more of the Ten Brain Domains. Essentially, growth deficiency and/or FAS facial features may be mild or nonexistent in other FASD conditions, but clinically significant brain damage of the central nervous system is present. In these other FASD conditions, an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the \"FAS face\" that might ordinarily trigger an FASD evaluation. Such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary mental health disorders such as ADHD or Oppositional Defiance Disorder without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders, which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders. While other FASD conditions may not yet be included as an ICD or DSM-IV-TR diagnosis, they nonetheless pose significant impairment in functional behavior because of underlying brain damage.\\n\\nPreviously known as Atypical FAS in the 1997 edition of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code,\" patients with Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure, but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata. Central nervous system damage is present at the same level as FAS. These individuals have the same functional disabilities but \"look\" less like FAS.\\n\\nThe following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of Partial FAS:\\n\\nAlcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND) was initially suggested by the Institute of Medicine to replace the term FAE and focus on central nervous system damage, rather than growth deficiency or FAS facial features. The Canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria. While the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories, it refers to this condition as static encephalopathy. The behavioral effects of ARND are not necessarily unique to alcohol however, so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure. ARND may be gaining acceptance over the terms FAE and ARBD to describe FASD conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or FAS facial features.\\n\\nThe following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of ARND or static encephalopathy:\\n\\nThis term was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (or unknown exposure for humans), but without obvious physical anomalies. Smith (1981) described FAE as an \"extremely important concept\" to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage, regardless of the growth or facial features. This term has fallen out of favor with clinicians because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than FAS, when in fact its effects can be just as detrimental.\\n\\nFormerly known as Possible Fetal Alcohol Effect (PFAE), Alcohol-Related Birth Defects (ARBD) was a term proposed as an alternative to FAE and PFAE The IOM presents ARBD as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use but have no key features of FASD. PFAE and ARBD have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of FASD. The Canadian guidelines recommend that ARBD should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for FASD.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fetal bovine serum", "body": "Fetal bovine serum or FBS (or fetal calf serum) is the portion of plasma remaining after coagulation of blood, during which process the plasma protein fibrinogen is converted to fibrin and remains behind in the clot. Fetal bovine serum comes from the blood drawn from a bovine fetus via a closed system of collection at the slaughterhouse (aka abattoir). Fetal bovine serum is the most widely used serum-supplement for the in vitro cell culture of eukaryotic cells. This is due to it having a very low level of antibodies and containing more growth factor, allowing for versatility in many different cell culture applications. \\n\\nThe globular protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), is a major component of fetal bovine serum. The rich variety of proteins in fetal bovine serum maintains cultured cells in a medium in which they can survive, grow, and divide. \\n\\nFetal Bovine serum is a by-product of the meat industry. Fetal bovine serum, as with the vast majority of animal serum used in cell culture, is produced from blood collected at commercial slaughterhouses from cattle bred to supply meat destined for human consumption. \\n\\nThe first stage of the production process for fetal bovine serum is the harvesting of blood from the bovine fetus. The blood is collected aseptically into a sterile container or blood bag and then allowed to clot before centrifugation to remove the fibrin clot and the remaining blood cells from the clear yellow (straw) coloured serum. The serum is then stored frozen prior to further processing in order to make it suitable for cell culture.\\n\\nThe second stage of processing involves filtration, typically culminating in a sterile 0.1 micron membrane filter. When processed by a reputable commercial serum supplier the sterile fetal bovine serum is subject to stringent quality control testing and is supplied with a detailed Certificate of Analysis giving full test results and information concerning the origin of the material. Certificates of Analysis vary between commercial suppliers but usually include the following details; filtration statement, country of origin, cell growth performance testing, microbial sterility testing, screening for mycoplasma and virus, endotoxin, haemoglobin, IgG and total protein assays.\\n\\nEthical questions have been raised regards the blood collection process with special emphasis on any potential discomfort caused to the fetus. Respected scientific investigation [1][2]has shown that the loss of blood circulation in the dam (mother animal) results in death within seconds of slaughter and that the fetus will be dead within a few minutes of the slaughter of the dam due to oxygen deprivation. In comparison, fetal bovine blood is collected from the bovine fetus only after the pregnant uterus has been removed from the slaughtered cow which, in a typical commercial slaughterhouse, means a delay of around 20 minutes from the time of slaughter. The time between maternal death and the start of fetal blood harvesting is relatively long and therefore means that there minimal possibility of brain activity in the fetus at the time of blood harvesting and hence minimal possibility of discomfort. And of course it is important to balance the ethical concerns surrounding the welfare of the donor animal against the highly significant benefits that the use of fetal bovine serum brings to human and animal health\\n\\nSerum Use\\n\\nFetal bovine serum is commercially available from many manufacturers, and because cells grown in vitro are highly sensitive, customers usually test specific batches to check for suitability for their specific cell type. When changing from batch to batch it is usual to adapt the cells to the new batch of material, for example, by mixing 50% of the old serum with 50% of the new serum and allowing the cells to acclimatise to the new material.\\n\\nSerum is stored frozen to preserve the stability of components such as growth factors. When serum is thawed, some precipitation may be seen. This is a normal phenomenon and it does not compromise the quality of serum in any way. The precipitate may be removed by transferring the serum to sterile tubes and centrifuging for 5 minutes at 400g.\\n\\nTo limit the amount of precipitation, it is recommended that the serum is thawed in a refrigerator at 2-8˚C. The serum should be regularly mixed during this process. Repeated freeze/thaw cycles should be avoided and it is advisable to dispense the serum into single use aliquots before freezing.\\n\\nSerum produced for use in the biotechnology industry and research sectors is highly regulated. The collection and movement of all animal derived products globally is strictly controlled.

{"title": "FieldTurf", "body": "FieldTurf is a brand of artificial turf playing surface. It is manufactured and installed by the FieldTurf Tarkett division of Tarkett Inc., based in Calhoun, Georgia, USA. In the late 1990s, the artificial surface changed the industry with a design intended to replicate real grass. The new system quickly began taking market share from AstroTurf, and is now the leader in the industry.\\n\\nThe surface is composed of monofilament polyethylene blend fiber tufted into a polypropylene backing. The infill is composed of a bottom layer of silica sand, a middle layer which is a mixture of sand and cryogenic rubber and a top layer of only rubber. The fibers are meant to replicate blades of grass, while the infill acts as a cushion. This cushion improves safety when compared to earlier artificial surfaces and allows players to plant and pivot as if they were playing on a grass field. Proponents of the surface also cite its low-cost maintenance and durability.\\n\\nJean Prévost bought the patent of the FieldTurf product in 1988 and originally named his company SynTenni Co., a name which would eventually be dropped in favor of FieldTurf Inc. In 1995, John Gilman, former CFL player and coach joined FieldTurf as CEO. The first professional team to install FieldTurf at its training facility was the English Premiership's Middlesbrough F.C. in 1997.\\n\\nThe merger allowed FieldTurf to expand their range of products in other types of sports surfacing and add Tarkett's turf options to their range of products. FieldTurf Tarkett is currently run by a head corporate office in Calhoun, USA along with other offices in Canada and in France. FieldTurf is now a part of the Tarkett Sports division and has installed over 3500 athletic fields.\\n\\nFieldTurf is made from washed silica sand and rounded cryogenic rubber. Each square foot of turf contains approximately 7 pounds of sand and 3 pounds of cryogenic rubber. FieldTurf does not use shock absorbency pads below its multi-layered infill. FieldTurf offers a number of different polyethylene fibers. The backing of the turf is a combination of woven and non-woven polypropylene. These materials are permeable and allow water to drain through the backing itself.thumb\\n\\nWith regard to injuries sustained, a 5 year study published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine found that injury rates were similar on natural grass and synthetic turf. There were, however, notable differences in the types of injuries. Athletes playing on synthetic turf sustained more skin injuries and muscle strains while those who played on natural grass were more susceptible to concussions and ligament tears. Martin O'Neill said FIFA officials should \"have their heads examined\" for allowing FieldTurf after Tomas Sorenson suffered a non-contact hamstring injury during a game in Toronto. According to FIFA at the time, 14% of injuries on grass were non-contact related while the figure rose to 22% on the turf.\\n\\nThe first installation in an NFL stadium was in 2002 at the Seattle Seahawks' new stadium, now known as Qwest Field. Artificial turfs had been disliked by players due to the injuries and soreness associated with playing on the previous generations' harder surfaces. Seattle's coach, Mike Holmgren, said of the FieldTurf surface \"it's about as much like grass as you can have a synthetic surface be\" and that the \"players love it\". As the trend continued in the league, FieldTurf received reviews from players who cited that the field provided cushioning for falls, eased pressure on the knees, and did not cause turf burns. Stadium operators also noted the benefits of the improved durability and easier maintenance over natural grass fields. Eleven NFL teams currently play their home games on FieldTurf while 15 teams have FieldTurf in their practice facilities. In 2006, Super Bowl XL, played at Detroit's Ford Field was the first Super Bowl to be played on FieldTurf. FieldTurf has also been endorsed by several NCAA Division I football coaches, including Houston Nutt, Jim Tressel, and Bobby Petrino.\\n\\nFieldTurf's first high profile installation came in January 1997 as English club Middlesbrough chose FieldTurf for its new training field. Only artificial fields with FIFA Recommended 2-star status can be used in FIFA and UEFA Finals competitions. Other FIFA and UEFA competitions require at least 1-star status. No World Cup Finals match has ever been played on an artificial surface.\\n\\nIn 2001, Boston University's FieldTurf soccer field became FieldTurf's first to obtain FIFA 1-star status. In 2005, Saprissa Stadium in San José, Costa Rica became the first stadium to host a FIFA World Cup qualifying match on FieldTurf. The Dundalk F.C. Stadium, Oriel Park received FieldTurf's first FIFA 2-star rating. FieldTurf currently has 29 FIFA Recommended 1-Star installations and 31 FIFA Recommended 2-Star installations. In 2007, the FIFA U-20 World Cup Canada had almost 50% of its games played on FieldTurf.\\n\\nThe emergence of the surface in association football stadiums has been controversial. Players and coaches have been critical of the toll it takes on a player's body, and have expressed concerns that it does not play enough like actual grass. The surface has also been criticized for the infill not staying in place. In 2007, Garry O'Connor spoke out against the FieldTurf surface he played on during a cup final with Lokomotiv Moscow. He called it a \"nightmare\" and said that he did not believe FIFA should allow qualifying matches to be played on the surface.\\n\\nAlthough there are players who dislike playing on artificial turf, FIFA president Sepp Blatter said that artificial turf will eventually become a big part of the game. \"This is not only a point to make headlines, it is the truth,\". \"Football on artificial turf is the future.\" \\n\\nThe use of FieldTurf in Major League Soccer has received criticism.\\n\\nThe installation of the surface at Qwest Field in Seattle was approved only after the operator of the then new stadium agreed to install a natural grass field when needed. Their concern derived from the surface potentially hindering the city's ability to attract an MLS franchise and international soccer events.\\n\\nIn September 2006, several top Canadian soccer players appealed to the Canadian Soccer Association to install a natural grass surface at BMO Field in Toronto. Darren Huckerby stated that was one reason he chose not to sign with Toronto FC.The club removed the FieldTurf playing surface and switched to a traditional grass surface starting in 2010 in a change that was welcomed by many players and fans.\\n\\nFollowing David Beckham's move to Major League Soccer in 2007, he voiced his opinion that the league should convert to grass for all pitches. In an apology, he stated that the surface is fine at lower levels but that his feelings hadn't changed about the MLS use because of the toll the harder surface takes on the body. He also stated: \"It's difficult but it's something we have to deal with. It's part of the MLS and we have to come to terms with it and I'm sure it will be fine.\"\\n\\nFieldTurf has been installed to cover the edges of runways at several airports. The company says that it improves visibility for pilots by reducing dust and debris and creating a sharper contrast with runway edges. It also eliminates food sources and shelter for wildlife, which can interfere with takeoffs and landings.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Field desorption", "body": "rightField desorption (FD)/field ionization (FI) refers to an ion source for mass spectrometry first reported by Beckey in 1969. In field ionization, a high-potential electric field is applied to an emitter with a sharp surface, such as a razor blade, or more commonly, a filament from which tiny \"whiskers\" have formed. This results in a very high electric field which can result in ionization of gaseous molecules of the analyte. Mass spectra produced by FI have little or no fragmentation. They are dominated by molecular radical cations M and less often, protonated molecules . \\n\\nIn FD, the analyte is applied as a thin film directly to the emitter, or small crystals of solid materials are placed onto the emitter. Slow heating of the emitter then begins, by passing a high current through the emitter, which is maintained at a high potential (e.g. 5 kilovolts). As heating of the emitter continues, low-vapor-pressure materials get desorbed and ionized by alkali metal cation attachment. \\n\\nMany earlier applications of FD/FI to analysis of polar and nonvolatile analytes such as polymers and biological molecules have largely been supplanted by newer ionization techniques. However, FD/FI remains one of the only ionization techniques that can produce simple mass spectra with molecular information from hydrocarbons and other particular analytes. The most commonly encountered application of FD/FI at the present time is the analysis of complex mixtures of hydrocarbons such as that found in petroleum fractions. \\n\\nThe recently developed liquid injection FD ionization (LIFDI)  technique \"presents a major breakthrough for FD-MS of reactive analytes\" : Transition metal complexes are neutral and due to their reactivity, do not undergo protonation or ion attachment. They benefit from both: the soft FD ionization and the safe and simple LIFDI transfer of air/moisture sensitive analyte solution. This transfer occurs from the Schlenk flask to the FD emitter in the ion source through a fused silica capillary without breaking the vacuum. \\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fifth force", "body": "Occasionally, physicists have postulated the existence of a fifth force in addition to the four known fundamental forces. The force is generally believed to have roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) and to have a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales.\\n\\nThe idea is difficult to test, because gravity is such a weak force: the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very precise equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of Loránd Eötvös from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.\\n\\nThere are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range.\\n\\nOne way is to search for a fifth force with tests of the strong equivalence principle: this is one of the most powerful tests of Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity. Alternative theories of gravity, such as Brans-Dicke theory, have a fifth force—possibly with infinite range. This is because gravitational interactions, in theories other than general relativity, have degrees of freedom other than the \"metric\", which dictates the curvature of space, and different kinds of degrees of freedom produce different effects. For example, a scalar field cannot produce the bending of light rays. The fifth force would manifest itself in an effect on solar system orbits, called the Nordtvedt effect. This is tested with Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and very long baseline interferometry.\\n\\nAnother kind of fifth force, which arises in Kaluza-Klein theory, where the universe has extra dimensions, or in supergravity or string theory is the Yukawa force, which is transmitted by a light scalar field (i.e. a scalar field with a long Compton wavelength, which determines the range). This has prompted a lot of recent interest, as a theory of supersymmetric large extra dimensions—dimensions with size slightly less than a millimeter—has prompted an experimental effort to test gravity on these very small scales. This requires extremely sensitive experiments which search for a deviation from the inverse square law of gravity over a range of distances. Essentially, they are looking for signs that the Yukawa interaction is kicking in at a certain length.\\n\\nAustralian researchers, attempting to measure the gravitational constant deep in a mine shaft, found a discrepancy between the predicted and measured value, with the measured value being two percent too small. They concluded that the results may be explained by a repulsive fifth force with a range from a few centimetres to a kilometre. Similar experiments have been carried out onboard a submarine (USS ''Dolphin'' (AGSS-555)) while deeply submerged. A further experiment measuring the gravitational constant in a deep borehole in the Greenland ice sheet found discrepancies of a few percent, but it was not possible to eliminate a geological source for the observed signal .\\n\\nSome experiments used lake and a 320m high tower A comprehensive review suggested there is no compelling evidence for the fifth force, though scientists still search for it.\\n\\nThe above experiments search for a fifth force that is, like gravity, independent of the composition of an object, so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses. Forces that depend on the composition of an object can be very sensitively tested by torsion balance experiments of a type invented by Loránd Eötvös. Such forces may depend, for example, on the ratio of proton to neutron in an atomic nucleus, or the relative amount of different kinds of binding energy in a nucleus (see the semi-empirical mass formula). Searches have been done from very short ranges, to municipal scales, to the scale of the Earth, the sun, and dark matter at the center of the galaxy.\\n\\nA few physicists think that Einstein's theory of gravity will have to be modified, not at small scales, but at large distances, or, equivalently, small accelerations. They point out that dark matter, dark energy and even the Pioneer anomaly are unexplained by the Standard Model of particle physics and suggest that some modification of gravity, possibly arising from Modified Newtonian Dynamics or the holographic principle. This is fundamentally different from conventional ideas of a fifth force, as it grows stronger relative to gravity at longer distances. Most physicists, however, think that dark matter and dark energy are not ad hoc, but are supported by a large number of complementary observations and described by a very simple model.\\n\\n"}

{"title": "Fight the Power", "body": "Fight the Power is a 1989 song by hip hop group Public Enemy. First released on the soundtrack for the film Do the Right Thing (Rosie Perez dances to the song over the opening credits), an edited version was released in 1990 on Public Enemy's third album, Fear of a Black Planet. The song has largely served as the political statement of purpose for the group, and is their biggest single. \"Fight the Power\" was recently ranked #1 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop, further demonstrating the impact of the song. The single reached #1 on Hot Rap Singles and #20 on the Hot R&B Singles. \\n\\nAnother version is featured in the Chuck D Presents: Louder than a Bomb compilation, featuring a saxophone solo by Branford Marsalis.\\n\\nBrian Hardgroove said, \"Law enforcement is necessary. As a species we haven’t evolved past needing that. Fight the Power is not about fighting authority—it’s not that at all. It’s about fighting abuse of power.\"\\n\\nSpike Lee produced and directed two music videos for this song. The first featured clips of various scenes from Do the Right Thing. In the second video, Lee used hundreds of extras to simulate a massive political rally in Brooklyn. The extras carry signs featuring Paul Robeson, Marcus Garvey, Chuck Berry and Martin Luther King, Jr. Tawana Brawley made a cameo appearance. Brawley gained national notoriety in 1987 when, at the age of 15, she accused several police officers and public officials from Wappingers Falls, New York of raping her. The charge was rejected in court, and she instead was sued for supposedly fabricating her story. Jermaine Dupri also made a cameo.\\n\\nIt is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, #322 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, #40 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Songs, and #288 on Songs of the Century. \"Fight the Power\" was also voted #68 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s and #1 on their list of 100 greatest hip hop songs of all time.\\n\\n\"Fight the Power\" was voted \"Best Single\" by the \"Pazz &amp; Jop\" critics poll of 1989.\\n\\n\"Fight the Power\" was covered, tongue-in-cheek, by Barenaked Ladies for their original 1991 cassette, now known as \"The Yellow Tape\", a version later used in the soundtrack for the 1993 movie Coneheads.

It writes of this image (described as Figure 1): \"There were 20 adult stumptails -- 17 males and 3 females -- living in 10 compatible pairs (Reinhardt, 1990), 5 pairs in lower-row double cages and 5 pairs in upper-row double cages. All cages were equipped with sturdy, replaceable plastic plates that fit into the cage door openings (Figure 1). Each plate had a face-shaped hole (14 cm wide, 17 cm high) fitting an adult stumptail's head and two smaller circular holes (10 cm diameter) fitting its forearms. The arrangement of the holes was such that an animal could reach out for food offered and eat it while presenting its forehead for treatment (Figure 1) . The three holes enabled an animal to secure and eat the food offered, but not to grab or bite the caretaker.\"  \\n\\nRationale: Low-quality image; no monetary value; no reason to suppose the copyright holder would mind; no free-licence equivalent; being used for informational purposes in the section of an article about these methods of restraint.\\n\\n"}

With practice, you can learn to \"hang\" horizontally on the stroke and you'll feel no lower back fatigue at All. If your back begins hurting, simply lean and stretch forward on the next stroke. Stretch your neck and drop your shoulders every few minutes.\\n\\nPaddling upwind can be hard work but you can still make good progress against the wind if you bear down and paddle effectively. When it's really windy and headway is difficult, wait for a lull in the wind and then paddle hard to the next spot where you can rest. Work your way upwind as close to the beach as possible. Take advantage of natural windbreaks like points or rocks or kelp beds for rest stops. Don't try to power up the faces of waves, you'll wear yourself out quickly working against gravity, and your kayak will pound - slowing you down. By: www.kayak-race.com\\n\\n"}

This image is in the form of a television screenshot from the Australian television series Sea Patrol (2007-present). This series was produced by McElroy All Media for the Nine Network, Australia. Sea Patrol DVDs are distributed by Roadshow Entertainment. Only a small portion of the work has been used (1 low-resolution image) and the image has been cropped as to only include the person. It is the purpose of this image to be used in the article about the same person, Andy Thorpe. In this article it is used in the character's info box to illustrate what the character looked like. This is quite significant to the article and relates directly to what (whom) the article is about and is the main subject. I have used a non-free television screenshot because there is no free alternative. This is because, quite obviously, the person pictured is a television character and could be found in no other place but a screenshot.\\n\\n"}
